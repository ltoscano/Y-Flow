<5>	MASASABI nating mahusay gumimik ang dalawang aktor ng Philippine show business na sina Baron Geisler at Kiko Matos.	we can say that the two actors of the Philippine show business who are Baron Geisler and Kiko Matos do gimmicks well.
<6>	Sabi nga, an idle mind is a devil’s workshop.	as said, an idle mind is a devil's workshop.
<7>	Ang alam natin, matagal-tagal na kasing walang proyekto sa pelikula o kahit sa telebisyon sina Geisler at Matos.	what we know, Geisler and Matos have no projects on movies or even television for some time.
<8>	Hanggang maganap nga ang kanilang sapakan sa isang bar sa Quezon City.	until their fight in a bar in Quezon city happened.
<9>	Akala natin, ito ay isang eksena na magwawakas sa korte…	we thought it was a scene that will finish in court...
<10>	Pero nagkamali po tayo dahil ang eksena ay magwawakas sa Universal Reality Combat Championship’s (URCC) MMA ring.	but we were mistaken because the scene will finish in the Universal Reality Combat Championship's (URCC) MMA ring.
<11>	Ang daming napapalakpak at napa-wow nang mabalitaan na gagawing pormal na laban ang away-kalye nina Geisler at Matos.	many clapped and were wowed upon learning that the street fight of Geisler and Matos will be made in to a formal fight.
<12>	Pero nagulat din agad ang lahat ng napapalakpak at napa-wow nang muli nilang mabalitaan na pagkakakitaan pala nang malaki ang ‘sapakan’ na ‘yan.	but everyone who clapped and were wowed were also immediately surprised when they learned that big money will be earned on that brawl.
<13>	E mantakin n’yo naman, tuloy na tuloy ang laban sa URCC Fight Night this coming June 25, 2016 sa Palace Pool Club pero para mapanood ito ay kailangan gumastos nang malaking halaga.	imagine it, the fight in the URCC fight night will continue on this coming June 25, 2016 at the palace pool club but big money is needed to be spent to watch it.
<14>	Ang “Single Entry” ay P1,200 (1 ticket no consumable drink nor food).	the "single entry" is P1,200 (1 ticket no consumable drink nor food).
<15>	Sa Mezzanine Skybox, tosgas ng P60,000, ‘yan ay may 15 tickets at P20,000 consumable.	in the mezzanine skybox, worth P60,000, that includes 15 tickets and P20,000 consumable.
<16>	Habang sa iba ay gagastos ng P60,000, P50,000, P45,000, P40,000 hanggang P35,000.	while in others will spend P60,000, P50,000, P45,000, P40,000 up to P35,000.
<17>	Mayroon din consumable food & drinks.	there is also consumable food and drinks.
<18>	O ‘di ba?	right?
<19>	Hindi ba’t maliwanag na gimik o negosyo ‘yang sapakan at pagbabati ‘kuno’ nitong sina Geisler at Matos?!	isn't it clear that Geisler and Matos' fight and so-called reconciliation is a gimmick or a business?
<20>	Paging movie producers and television networks, bigyan na ninyo ng project ang dalawang ‘yan para magkaroon ng pagkakakitaan hindi ‘yung kung ano-anong gimik ang ginagawa para kumita!	paging movie producers and television networks, give projects to those two to have earnings instead of doing gimmicks to earn!
<21>	Kamag-anak Inc., umeepal sa Manila City Hall	relatives incorporated showing off at Manila city hall
<22>	In fairness, mayroon din talagang mga pinagkakatiwalaang tao si Yorme Erap Estrada na mapagkakatiwaalan at talagang nagseserbisyo sa bayan.	in fairness, there are really trusted people by Yorme Erap Estrada who can be trusted and really serve the nation.
<23>	Maraming empleyado ng Manila city hall, ang nakapapansin ngayon na may Kamaganak Inc. ang madalas na nakikialam na sa mga official function ng ilang departamento.	many employees of the Manila city hall, now notice that there is a relatives incorporate that frequently meddle in the official function of some departments.
<24>	‘Yun nga lang kapag hindi raw kikita ‘yung KAMAG-ANAK Inc., tinutsugi ang mga project ng mga seryoso, dedikado at determinadong opisyal sa Erap administration.	if the relatives incorporated does not earn, the projects of the serious, dedicated and determined officials in the Erap administration are terminated.
<25>	Tapos papalitan umano ng mga project na kikita sila pero ang gagamitin pa rin ‘yung opisina ng tsinuging proyekto.	after which replaced allegedly by projects where they will earn but the office of the terminated project will still be used.
<26>	Ano ba ‘yan?	what is that?
<27>	Parang gusto nating maniwala na kaya nasentensiyahan ng Plunder si Erap ‘e dahil sa mga taong hindi niya matanggihan at pagkatapos ay hahatakin ang buong pamilya.	we are inclined to believe that Erap was sentenced with plunder because of this people that he cannot refuse and afterwards pulls the entire family.
<28>	Araykupo!	ouch!
<29>	Mayor Erap, nasa ikalawang termino na po kayo, baka puwede namang magtrabaho ‘este’ i-check ninyo ‘yung mga ‘pinagkakatiwalaan’ ninyo na baka hindi ninyo alam, sa kagustuhang kumita nang malaki at easy money ay naililigwak na kayo?!	mayor Erap, you are on your second term, maybe it is possible to work "instead" check those you "trust" that you do not know, in the desire to earn big and easy money are harming you?!
<30>	Sabi nga ninyo, “I learned not to be trusting…”	you did say, "I learned not to be trusting..."
<31>	Gawin na ninyong gabay ‘yan laban sa mga taong nakadikit, nakabuntot at nagkukunwaring dikit ninyo pero inaabuso ang paggamit sa pangalan ninyo.	use that as your guidance against those people who are sticking close to you, trailing off and pretending as your close acquaintance but abusing the use of your name.
<32>	Baka kasi isang araw ‘e magising kayo na wala na ang mga tunay at mapagkakatiwalaang tao ninyo kalalaglag ng mga ‘malalapit’ sa inyo.	maybe one day you wake up without your true and trusted people being ousted by those "close" to you.
<33>	Unsolicited advice lang po.	unsolicited advice only.
<34>	All of war sa VK, wa epek sa MPD PS-10 at PS-4!?	all of war sa VK, no effect on MPD ps-10 at ps-4!?
<35>	Mukhang tablado ang utos ni MPD district director Gen. Rolando Nana na hulihin at kompiskahin ang lahat ng video karera machine (VK) sa lungsod ng Maynila sa ilang station commander niya.	it looks like the command of MPD district director general Rolando Nana to catch and confiscate all video race machines (vk) in the city of Manila to some of his station commanders is futile.
<36>	Karamihan sa mga police station commander sa Manila Police District ay tumalima naman daw sa utos ni General Nana kahit na may isyu na may ibang ‘player’ daw pala na siyang papapasukin at hahawak na ng video karera sa Maynila?!	most of the police station commanders of the Manila Police District apparently obey the command of General Nana even if there is an issue that there is another 'player' that will enter and manage the video races in Manila?!
<37>	Pero si P/Supt. LEONARDO, hepe ng Manila Police District Pandacan Police Station #10 at si P/Supt. MUARIP ng Police station 4 ay mistulang nagtengang kawali daw sa utos ni Gen. Nana?!	but police superintendent Leonardo, chief of the Manila police district Pandacan police station #10 and police superintendent Muarip of police station 4 appear to ignore command of general Nana?!
<38>	Ayon sa mga residente ng Pandacan, nagtataka sila kung bakit hindi pa rin matinag-tinag ang mga video karera machine ni alias TATA TALYADA sa kanilang lugar.	according to the residents of Pandacan, they were wondering why the video race machines of alias Tata Talyada were unfazed in their place.
<39>	Magkano ‘este’ anong dahilan Kernel Leonardo??	how much er what is the reason, Colonel Leonardo??
<40>	By the way, totoo ba na ipinamamalita mo na kapitbahay mo si incoming President Rody Duterte at kalaro mo pa raw sa pusoy?	by the way, is it true that you are spreading the news that your neighbor is incoming president Rody Duterte and he is also your playmate in betting?
<41>	‘Yan ho kasi ang ipinagyayabang ni alias Tata Talyado sa MPD HQ, kaya ‘yun mga opisyal na gustong mapuwesto nang maganda ay dapat na raw dumikit sa kanya?	that is what alias Tata Talyado was bragging about at the MPD HQ, so the officials who want a nice position should get close to him?
<42>	Paki-explain nga Kernel Leonardo!	please explain colonel Leonardo!
<43>	Sagutin ang isyu ng Lawton Illegal Parking!	answer the issue of Lawton illegal parking!
<44>	Boss Jerry,	boss Jerry,
<45>	Tama kayo sa ginagawa ninyo na huwag patulan ang mga walang kedebilidad.	you are right in what you are doing on not to pay attention to those without credibility.
<46>	Dapat ang sagutin nila ang isyu ng illegal parking sa Plaza Lawton na kinakaladkad ang Manila City Hall.	what they should answer is the issue on illegal parking in plaza Lawton that is dragging the Manila city hall.
<47>	Bakit hindi kumikilos ang barangay at PCP Lawton na nakasasakop sa area ng Plaza Lawton na pugad ng illegal parking?	why is the community and PCP Lawton that has jurisdiction on the area in plaza Lawton that is the nest of illegal parking not acting on this?
<48>	Tama ang sinabi ni Erap nang tanungin siya kung ano ang natutuhan niya nitong nakaraang eleksiyon, ang sabi niya… “I learned not to be trusting.”	Erap said it right when he was asked what he learned this past election, he said... "I learned not to be trusting."
<49>	Naramdaman daw kasi ni Erap na bina-limbing siya ng isa sa kanyang mga pinagkatiwalaan na sumasalok ng election funds mula riyan sa illegal parking sa Lawton.	Erap apparently felt that he was betrayed by one of those he trusted who stole election funds from that illegal parking in Lawton.
<50>	At ngayon naman, kinakaladkad ang kanyang pangalan ng matandang Burikak na siyang nagrereyna sa illegal parking na ‘yan.	and now, his name is being dragged by the older Burikak who is reigning in that illegal parking.
<51>	Kilala namin ‘yang ginagamit na ‘arkiladong manunulot’ ni Burikak.	we know that "hired cheater" used by Burikak.
<52>	Isinusuka namin ‘yan dito sa city hall dahil sa panununog ng pera.	he is rejected here in the city hall because of his dishonesty on money.
