<1>	SIDEKICK NI LOPEZ MAY RAKET	sidekick of Lopez has a racket.
<2>	NAKADUDUDA nang iutos ni DENR Secretary Gina Lopez ang pagsasara sa ilang maliliit na mining company samantalang pinayagan niyang magpatuloy ang operasyon ng mga malalaking kompanya na talamak sa environmental violations.	it was suspicious when DENR Secretary Gina Lopez ordered the closure of several small mining companies, while she allowed the operations of big companies with a lot of environmental violations to continue.
<3>	Taliwas ito sa ipinangako ni Lopez nang hirangin siya ni Pangulong Duterte na maging kalihim.	it was contrary to what Lopez promised when she was appointed by President Duterte as secretary.
<4>	Nangako itong ipasasara ang mga minahan na matagal nang nang-aabuso sa ating likas na yaman.	she promised to close down mines that have been abusing our natural resources for a long time.
<5>	Kaya may mga nagtatanong: May tililing ba itong si DENR Secretary o may iba pang dahilan kaya kaagad tinalikuran ang kanyang pangako?	so there are some who ask: is the DENR secretary crazy or does she have another reason for immediately going back on her promise?
<6>	Minarapat kong mag-imbestiga at nalaman ko nga mula sa DENR insiders na isang ranking official at adviser ni Lopez ang isang “silent partner” ng mga operator ng erring mining firms.	I decided to investigate and I found out from DENR insiders that one "silent partner" of operators of erring mining firms is a ranking official and adviser of Lopez.
<7>	No wonder now!	no wonder now!
<8>	At heto nga ang ilang kompanya na tinukoy na hindi pumasa sa DENR audit and inspection ngunit pinapayagan na makapagpatuloy sa panggagahasa sa kalikasan: Libjo Mining Corp; AAMPHIL Natural Resources and Development Corp; Krominco, Inc; Carrascal Nickel Corp; Marcventures Mining and Dev. Corp; Filmenera Resources Corp; Strongbuilt Mining Dev. Corp; Sinosteel Phil. Mining Corp; Oriental Synergy Mining Corp; Wellex Mining Corp; Oriental Vision Mining Phil. Corp; CTP Const. and Mining Corp; Agata Mining Ventures, Inc; Hinatuan Mining Corp; Benguet Corp; Lepanto Consolidate Mining Company; Oceana-Gold Phil. Inc; Adnama Mining Resources Inc; SR Metals, Inc. Nahalata yata ito ng Commission on Appointments kaya hindi mabasbasan ang pagkakahirang dito sa palpak na pagkapili ni Manong Digong.	and here are some companies that were identified to have not passed the DENR audit and inspection, but are being allowed to continue abusing the environment: Libjo Mining Corporation; AAMPHIL Natural Resources and Development Corporation; Krominco, Incorporated; Carrascal Nickel Corporation; Marcventures Mining and Develeopment Corporation; Filmenera Resources Corporation; Strong-built Mining Develeopment Corporation; Sinosteel Philippines Mining Corporation; Oriental Synergy Mining Corporation; Wellex Mining Corporation; Oriental Vision Mining Philippines Corporation; CTP Construction and Mining Corporation; Agata Mining Ventures, Incorporated; Hinatuan Mining Corporation; Benguet Corporation; Lepanto Consolidate Mining Company; Oceana-Gold Philippines Incorporated; Adnama Mining Resources Incorporated; SR Metals, Incorporated. this was seemed to be noticed by the Commission on Appointments, which was why her appointment through the faulty selection of Brother Digong cannot be approved.
<9>	Manong Digong should think twice before extending Lopez as DENR chief.	Brother Digong should think twice before extending Lopez as DENR chief.
<10>	She doesn’t care, anyway, if she is confirmed or not as long as the President keeps extending her term as DENR secretary.	she doesn't care, anyway, if she is confirmed or not as long as the president keeps extending her term as DENR secretary.
<11>	Ano bang klase ang takbo ng pag-iisip nitong si Lopez?	what kind of thinking does Lopez have?
