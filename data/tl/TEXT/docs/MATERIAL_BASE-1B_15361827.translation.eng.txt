<2>	August 18, 2016	August 18, 2016
<3>	MATUNOG na pinag-uusapan kahapon ang pagpirma raw ni Kris Aquino sa APT Entertainment kamakalawa.	Kris Aquino's alleged signing with APT Entertainment the other day is being loudly talked about.
<4>	Totoo bang nagtatampo si Kuya Boy Abunda kay Kris dahil hindi man lang siya kinunsulta nang pumirma ito sa APT?	is it true that Brother Boy Abunda is disheartened about Kris because he was not even consulted when she signed in the APT?
<5>	Nagulat na lang daw si Kuya Boy nang nalaman niya na hindi man lang ipinaalam sa kanya ni Kris.	Brother Boy is shocked when he learned that Kris did not even inform this to him.
<6>	Ang sabi pa ng aming source, hindi raw pipigilan ni Kuya Boy si Kris.	as our source said, Brother Boy will not stop Kris.
<7>	Pero sana, sinabi man lang daw sana sa kanya para maplantsa nila nang maayos kung ano ang tatakbuhin ng career niya sa pagpirma nito sa APT.	but hopefully, it could have been told to him so they can smoothen the run of her career when she signs in the APT.
<8>	Sinusubukan naming tawagan si Kuya Boy pero hindi niya sinasagot ang mga tawag namin.	we are trying to call Brother Boy but he is not answering our calls.
<9>	Sa aming pagkaka­kilala sa dalawa, parang ayaw namin maniwalang nagkaroon ng tampuhan.	as we have known the two, seems like we do not want to believe that they are disheartened for each other.
<10>	Imposibleng ­hindi ipaalam ni Kris kay Kuya Boy ang malaking ­desisyong iyun.	it is impossible for Kris not to inform Brother Boy about this big decision.
<11>	Pero ang pagkaka­alam namin, ang mga endorsement lang ni Kris ang pinapakialaman ni Kuya Boy.	but as we know it, Brother Boy only put his hands on Kris' endorsement.
<12>	Pagdating sa kanyang showbiz career, si Deo Endrinal ang nagha-­handle, kaya wala si­gurong kinalaman diyan ang King of Talk.	in terms of her career in show business, Deo Endrinal handles it, so the King of Talk must not have anything to do with it.
<13>	Pero dahil sa closeness nilang dalawa, malamang na na-open ‘yan ni Kris kay Kuya Boy.	but because of the closeness of the two, Kris could have said it to Brother Boy.
<14>	Wala kaming nakuhang detalye tungkol sa pirmahan.	we have not gotten any detail about the signing.
<15>	Hindi alam ng aming source kung program o managerial contract ang pinirmahan ng Queen of All Media.	our source does not if the Queen of all Media signed a program or managerial contract.
<16>	May ilang ­followers si Kris sa Instagram account niya na nagtatanong kung totoong pumirma na ito ng mana­gerial contract sa APT.	there are some followers of Kris on her Instagram account who are asking if it is true that she has signed a managerial contract with APT.
<17>	May ilang namba-bash na dahil kinukuwestiyon na nila ang lo­yalty nito.	there are some who are bashing because they are questioning her loyalty.
<18>	Kung totoo ito, ang ganda naman ng timing­ ni Kris.	if this is true, Kris' timing is really good.
<19>	Umapir muna ito sa grand opening ng Ka ­Tunying’s Café ng mag-asawang Anthony at Rossel Taberna at saka pumirma sa APT.	she appeared first in the grand opening of ComradeTunying's Cafe of the couple Anthony and Rossel Taberna and then signed in the APT.
<20>	Tuluy-tuloy siyang pinag-uusapan.	she is being talked about continuously.
<21>	May ilan ­kaming nariri­nig na mga reaksyon sa isyung ito.	we have heard few reactions on this issue.
<22>	Isang Kapuso ar­tist ang gulat na gulat na nag-­react sa napipintong ­paglipat ni Kris sa GMA 7.	one Kapuso artist is very shocked who reacted about the impending transfer of Kris to GMA 7.
<23>	Kung magkakaroon nga ito ng programa sa APT, siyempre, sa GMA 7 ito eere.	if she is going to have program in APT, of course, it will air on GMA 7.
<24>	Kaya isang Kapuso artist daw ang nagbitaw ng dialogue na feel niya kung gaano siya kamahal ni Kris dahil sinundan pa siya sa GMA 7.	so one Kapuso artist expressed a dialogue on how he was loved by Kris because she followed him on GMA 7.
<25>	Kung ganu’n ang mangyari, masaya ito!	if that is going to happen, this is fun!
<26>	Aba­ngan na lang natin!	let us just anticipate!
