<2>	Nauna rito ay nangako si Pacquiao na bibigyan niya ng limang milyong piso ang ­sinumang atletang Pinoy na mag-uuwi ng gintong medalya sa Rio Olympics. Muntik nang mapasubo si Pacquiao sa kanyang pangako nang kapusin si Diaz at magkasya sa silver medal sa pagbuhat ng 200-kilogram sa women’s 53-kg category ng weighlifting.	earlier Pacquiao promised to give five million pesos to any Filipino athlete who will bring home a gold medal in the Rio Olympics. Pacquiao almost ate his promise when he talked to Diaz and fit the silver medal from carrying 200 kilograms in the women's 53-kg category of weightlifting.
<3>	Siya rin ang unang Pinay at taga-Mindanao na nakakuha ng medalya sa Olympics.	she is also the first Filipina and Mindanao native to get a medal in the Olympics.
<4>	Hindi naman uuwing luhaan si Diaz kay Pacquiao dahil kahit konti ay may iaabot pa rin daw ito galing sa sariling bulsa.	Diaz will not go home empty-handed from Pacquiao because he will give even a little from his own pocket.
<5>	“Huwag na nating i-announce,” pakiusap ni Pacman kung magkano ang ibibigay niya kay Diaz.	"let us not announce it," Pacman requested about how much he will give Diaz.
<6>	Kasabay nito, tiniyak naman ni Senate Minority Leader Ralph Recto na makukuha pa rin ni Diaz ang five million peso incentive sa ilalim ng National ­Athletes and Coaches Benefits and Incentives law o Republic Act 10699 kahit na wala pang Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR).	together with this, Senate Minority Leader Ralph Recto ensured that Diaz will still get the five million peso incentive under the National Athletes and Coaches Benefits and Incentives law or Republic Act 10699 even if there are still no implementing rules and regulations (IRR).
<7>	“Kahit walang IRR, automatic ‘yan, as written in the law,”ani Recto ­bagama’t duda ito kung libre sa buwis ang insentibo.	"even with no IRR, that is automatic, as written in the law," said Recto despite doubting if the incentive is tax-free.
<8>	“Unang- una, dapat tax-free ‘yung five million prize niya. Tax-free din dapat ‘yung kalahati nun na mapupunta sa coach,”giit ng senador.	"first and foremost, her five-million peso prize should be tax-free. the half that will go to the coach should also be tax-free," stressed the senator.
