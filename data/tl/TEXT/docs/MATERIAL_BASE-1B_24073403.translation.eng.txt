<5>	PAK: Nabago ang pagtingin ng mga waiter at waitress ng isang bar sa Kabisayaan kay young actress na kung saan nagkaroon siya ng show sa lugar na iyun.	pak: the opinion on a young actress by waiters and waitresses of a bar in Visayas changed, when she had a show in that place.
<6>	Hindi lang alam ng aming source kung nakailang bote ng beer si young actress, pero tiyak niyang uminom siya roon at umorder pa ng ilang pica-pica para pulutan niya.	our source just doesn't know how many bottles of beer the young actress had, but he is sure that she drank there an even ordered some light food as her snacks.
<7>	Pagkatapos niyang uminom, binigay sa kanya ang bill pero bigla itong nagreklamo dahil ang dami raw nilagay sa bill niya na kailangang bayaran.	after she drank, the bill was given to her but she suddenly complained because she needed to pay too many things that was supposedly placed in her bill.
<8>	Ayaw na niyang ba­yaran ang bill dahil ang dami raw dinagdag na hindi naman daw niya in-order.	she no longer wanted to pay the bill because supposedly many things were added that she did not order.
<9>	Mabuti at nandun ang ilang production staff na nag-aayos ng show niya, kaya sinabihan na lang daw ang waiter na huwag na lang itong singilin, at sila na lang ang bahala.	good thing some production staff who managed her show were there, so they just told the waiter to not charge her anymore, and they will take care of it.
<10>	Bumalik ang waiter kay young actress at sinabi sa kanyang babayaran na lang daw ito ng production staff niya.	the waiter returned to the young actress and said her productions staff will just pay for it.
<11>	“Okay,” lang ang sagot ni young actress at sabay alis na nakalibre tuloy nang pantoma at pulutan.	"okay," was the only reply of the young actress then she left, getting away with free drinks and snacks.
<12>	Boom panes!	boom panes!
<13>	BOOM: Dalawang beses na palang nakasama ni Raymart Santiago ang mga anak nila ni Claudine Barretto.	boom: turns out Raymart Santiago had hung out with his children with Claudine Barretto two times.
<14>	Mukhang maganda nga ang pag-uusap ng mag-asawa sa harap ng korte, pero ang latest na narinig namin, hindi na naman nailabas ng aktor ang kanyang mga anak.	it looks like the couple's talks in front of the court went well, but the latest we heard, the actor was not able to hang out with his children.
<15>	May kinalaman kaya ito sa gulo ng mga abogado nila na ikinagalit ni Claudine?	does their argument with the lawyers, which angered Claudine, have something to do with this?
<16>	Ang abogado ni Raymart na si Atty. Ruth Castelo ang sinisisi ni Claudine kaya magulo na naman daw.	Raymart's lawyer, Attorney Ruth Castelo, is blamed by Claudine why there is chaos again.
<17>	Ang narinig namin, maaayos lang daw sila uli ni Raymart kung tatanggalin ang abogado nitong si Atty. Castelo.	what we heard, Raymart and she will only make up if he will fire his lawyer Attorney Castelo.
<18>	Kaya balak na sana ni Atty. Castelo na mag-withdraw bilang abogado ni Raymart, pero hindi naman pumayag ang aktor.	so Attorney Castelo was hoping to withdraw as lawyer of Raymart, but the actor did not permit it.
<19>	As of presstime, si Atty. Castelo pa rin naman ang legal counsel ni Raymart at hindi pa rin naman ito tinanggal.	as of press time, Attorney Castelo is still the legal counsel of Raymart and he has not been fired yet.
