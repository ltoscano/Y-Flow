<4>	By the way, ito na ang aming ika-20th year sa active service.	by the way, this is already our 20th year in active service.
<5>	Most importantly, ang tradisyong ito ay ginagawa namin para gunitain ang mga magagandang alaala ng aming mga mistahs noong nabubuhay pa sila.	most importantly, we do this tradition to remember the good memories of our squad members when they were still alive.
<6>	Dahil nasa Maynila lang ako nakadestino, minabuti kong sumama para muling mapadama sa aking mga namatay na mistah na hindi ko sila nakakalimutan.	because I was destined only in Manila, I preferred to join to again express to my dead squad members that I have not forgotten them.
<7>	Bawat isa sa aking mga mistahs ay merong halaga sa akin. Ngunit, merong iilan na may fond memories na nakaukit na sa aking puso't isipan.	each one of my squad members has value to me. but, there are some with fond memories carved to my heart and mind.
<8>	Nang nakita ko ang puntod ni Lt Col Ronaldo Sacatani ng Philippine Air Force, bigla kong naalala ang aming pinagsamahan sa Maguindanao noong 1997.	when I saw the grave of Lieutenant Colonel Ronaldo Sacatani of the Philippine Air Force, I instantly remembered our companionship in Maguindanao in 1997.
<9>	Allow me to share my memorable experience sa aking assignment sa balwarte ng mga Moro Islamic Liberation Front sa Central Mindanao nang malipat dito ang aking kumpanya, ang 7th Scout Ranger Company, noong January 1997.	allow me to share my memorable experience in my assignment to the fort of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in Central Mindanao when my company was transferred there, the 7th scout ranger company, in January 1997.
<10>	Maguindanao adventures	Maguindanao adventures
<11>	Dumating ako sa Maguindanao noong ika-3 ng February 1997.	I arrived in Maguindanao on the 3rd of February 1997.
<12>	Nahuli akong dumating dito dahil sa ako ang nag-transport ng aming Kennedy Type Jeep lulan ng barko mula Maynila.	I was late to arrive there because I was the one who transported our Kennedy type jeep aboard a ship from Manila.
<13>	Nang ako ay dumating, kakatapos lang ng aking kubo-kubo.	when I arrived, my hut was just finished.
<14>	Yari ito sa niyog, as in 'all niyog' ang mga raw materials simula sa bubong, dingding at pati ang frame ng aking papag.	it was made of coconut, as in the raw materials are 'all coconut' starting from the roof, ceiling and even frame of my bed.
<15>	Let me call that the Coconut Palace este Coco Hut.	let me call that the coconut palace I mean coco hut.
<16>	Ayos naman ang aking new assignment although naninibago ako.	my new assignment was all right even though I still felt new.
<17>	Ang aming kampo ay sa Bgy Mileb, Sultan sa Barongis, Maguindanao.	our camp was in Barangay Mileb, Sultan in Barongis, Maguindanao.
<18>	Katabi namin ang kampo ng 78th Infantry Battalion at mga dalawang kilometro lang ang layo ay nandoon naman ang 11th Infantry Battalion.	we were beside the camp of the 78th infantry battalion and only two kilometers away there was the 11th infantry battalion.
<19>	Mga 3-4 kilometro naman mula sa aming kampo, andoon naman ang Reina Regente Mountains at ang Liguasan Marsh na kung saan ay naglipana naman ang hanay ng MILF sa mga karatig na lugar.	some 3-4 kilometers from our camp, there was the Reina Regente Mountains and the Liguasan Marsh wherein the ranks of the MILF had spread in nearby areas.
<20>	Sa ikalawang araw ko sa kampo, pinagtyagaan kong i-supervise mismo ang pag-gawa ng sandbags ang gilid ng aking kubo para masalo naman ang ibang mga punglo at mga shrapnel na umuuulan tuwing magkaroon ng harrassments.	in my second day at camp, I myself diligently supervised the creation of sandbags the side of my hut to catch the other bullets and shrapnel raining down every time there are harassments.
<21>	Noong ika-5 ng Pebrero, nagpasya akong mamili ng dagdag na kagamitan sa bayan ng Tacurong na kung saan ay merong nag-iisang mall.	on the 5th of February, I decided to shop for additional supplies in the town of Tacurong where there was a single mall.
<22>	Sideline ko na rin noon ang pagkabisado sa roadnets sa area at kung saan ang mga lugar na may ambush areas.	it was also my sideline back then to memorize the road nets in the area and where are the places with ambush areas.
<23>	Bandang 7:00am noon, nang nagpaalam ako sa aking C.O. na si 1st Lt Jason Aquino para sa aking intensyon na mag-'malling' sa Tacurong.	it was around 7:00am back then, when I told my C.O. 1st Lieutenant Jason Aquino about my intention to go 'malling' in Tacurong.
<24>	"I-regards mo ko sa mga nag-gagandahang mga Ilongga sa Tacurong, Harold! Ingat sa ambush sites sa pagitan ng Mileb at ng Lambayong," wika pa noon ng aking boss.	'give my regards to the beautiful Illongas in Tacurong, Harold! beware of ambush sites between Mileb and Lambayong,' said my boss back then.
<25>	Dahil sa narinig kong marami raw magagandang Ilongga na girls doon, kuntodo porma naman ako bago umalis.	because I heard there were supposedly many beautiful Illonga girls there, I dressed up before leaving.
<26>	Suot-suot ko pa ang aking bull ring at ang aking golden pendant.	I was even wearing my bull ring and my golden pendant.
<27>	Maliban doon, halos maligo ako ng perfume dahil ayaw ko namang mangamoy Musang sa kabihasnan.	aside from that, I almost showered in perfume because I did not want to smell like a Musang in town.
<28>	Yon lang ang concept ko ng "winning the hearts" and minds sa panahon na iyon.	that was my only concept of "winning the hearts" and minds at that time.
<29>	Hmmmm.	hmm.
<30>	Saan na ang koneksiyon kay Lt Sacatani?	where is the connection to Lieutenant Sacatani?
<31>	Wait lang tsong.	just wait bro.
<32>	Let me continue.	let me continue.
<33>	Malapit na.	it is close.
<34>	So, binabaybay na namin ang kalsada papuntang Tacurong na sa estimate ay humigit kumulang 40 minutes ang byahe gamit ang aming Humvee.	so, we traversed the road toward Tacurong that in estimate is more or less a 40 minute journey using our Humvee.
<35>	Natatanaw ko na noon ang Lambayong sa may unahan ng mapansin ko ang tawag sa aking dalang hand-held radio. Nasa kabilang linya si Lt Aquino.	I could see Lambayong then by the front when I noticed the call on the hand-held radio I brought. on the other line was Lieutenant Aquino.
<36>	"Harold, abort mo yang iyong lakad. Me emergency situation dito. Kailangan ang iyong special skills ngayon na agad," sabi ng aking bossing na tila ay may pag-alala sa kanyang boses.	"Harold, abort your trip. I have an emergency situation here. we need your special skills at once," said my boss seemingly with worry in his voice.
<37>	Sa ganong sitwasyon, no more mental reservations.	in a situation like that, no more mental reservations.
<38>	Dapat aksyon agad at baka buhay ang nakasalalay.	must act immediately and maybe life is at stake.
<39>	"Wilco instruction sir.	"wilco instruction sir.
<40>	Turning around and coming back in 20 minutes or less."	turning around and coming back in 20 minutes or less."
<41>	In short, halos paliparin na ni SSg Antonio, ang aking batikang driver ng Humvee ang aming sasakyan para makarating agad sa aming kampo.	in short, Staff Sergeant Antonio, the veteran driver of the Humvee almost flew our vehicle so we can arrive instantly in our camp.
<42>	Hindi namin alam kung ano ang nature ng emergency ngunit handa kaming mag-responde kung kailangan.	we did not know the nature of the emergency but we were ready to respond when necessary.
<43>	Nang dumating kami sa kampo, nakita ko na may dalawang Huey Chopper na umaandar sa may helipad iilang metro lamang sa labas ng perimeter fence.	when we arrived at camp, I saw that there were two Huey choppers running by the helipad just a few meters outside the perimeter fence.
<44>	May naka-full battle gear nang mga tropa ang nakatayo sa labas ng aking barracks. Andon din si CO at ang aking Executive Officer na si Lt Mike Banua.	there were troops already on full battle gear standing outside my barracks. also there was my CO and my executive officer Lieutenant Mike Banua.
<45>	"Uy sir, anong nangyari at bakit tila ay may deployment tayo?"	"hey sir, what happened and why does it seem that we have a deployment?"
<46>	Don ko narinig ang pinakamabilis na mission briefing mula sa aking CO: "Na-pin down ang isang Infantry Company ng 61st Infantry Battalion sa baba ng Hill 292 sa Shariff Aguak. Kailangan ng sniper support at ikaw ang mag-lead kasama ang isang Section ng tropa.	there I heard the fastest mission briefing from my CO: "one infantry company of the 61st infantry battalion was pinned down at the bottom of Hill 292 in Shariff Aguak. sniper support is needed and you will lead together with one section of the troop.
<47>	Ang complete mission briefing ay doon na sa headquarters ng 61st IB.	the complete mission briefing will be there in the headquarters of the 61st IB.
<48>	Ang dalawang choppers na nasa labas ang sasakyan nyo.	the two choppers outside will be your vehicle.
<49>	Alis na kayo after 5 minutes!"	you leave after 5 minutes!"
<50>	Parang nabigla ako at na-shock. Takot? Kaba. Yes, kinabahan ako bigla sa di ko alam anong dahilan.	it was as if I was surprised and shocked. fear? worry. yes, I was suddenly worried for reasons I did not know.
<51>	Marami kasi akong inisip.	because I had many thoughts.
<52>	Mali ata kasuotan ko. Naka black suit ako. Me kurontong pa akong mga alahas.	maybe my attire was wrong. I had on a black suit. I was even wearing jewelry.
<53>	Yong gamit ko eh dapat kumpletuhin ko sa aking combat pack. Ewan, basta dami ko biglang mental baggage.	my equipment I had to complete in my combat pack. I don't know, I just suddenly had so much mental baggage.
<54>	"Sir, pwede after 5 minutes?	"sir, perhaps after 5 minutes?
<55>	Yong back pack at special equipment ko pa, aayusin ko pa."	my backpack and special equipment too, I still have to prepare."
<56>	Don naman nagsalita ang aking Ex-O na si Sir Mike: "Don't worry Harold, ako na nag-pack up para sa iyo. Sure na akong di ka magutom at may matulugan ka na rin. Andyan na ang iyong poncho at duyan."	there my ex-o Sir Mike spoke: "don't worry Harold, I already packed up for you. I am sure you will not be hungry and have somewhere to sleep too. your poncho and hammock are there already."
<57>	Napatawa na lang ako. Mantakin mo namang si O-Ex pa ang mag-pack up para sa akin. Wala na akong rason.	I just laughed. just think it was the o-ex who even packed up for me. I had no reason anymore.
<58>	Don ko hinarap ang aking mga kasama. 14 sila, kasama ang aking mga mandirigmang si Cpl Dimaano at Cpl Galamay, at ako ang pang-15.	it was there I looked for my companions. they were 14, including my fighters Corporal Dimaano and Corporal Galamay, and I was the 15th.
<59>	"Gentlemen, mukhang ma-aksyon tong puntahan natin.	"gentlemen, it looks like our destination is action-packed.
<60>	Di ko rin alam ang sitwasyon sa ground at mamaya pa ang final briefing natin.	I also do not know the situation in the ground and our final briefing is still later.
<61>	Magtiwala lang tayo sa Diyos na hindi tayo mapahamak.	let us just trust God that we will not be harmed.
<62>	Tayo na lang inaantay ng mga na-pin down nating mga kasamahan.	we are the only ones our pinned down companions are waiting for.
<63>	Rangers Lead the Way, lets go!"	rangers lead the way, lets go!"
<64>	Sinaluduhan ko para magpaalam sa aking mga opisyal.	I saluted to say goodbye to my officials.
<65>	Nagbilin naman si Lt Aquino sa akin: "Ingatan mo ang tropa Harold. Kaya mo yan!"	and Lieutenant Aquino ordered to me: "take care of the troop Harold. you can do it!"
<66>	Nang umangat na ang mga choppers na aming sinakyan, hinatid pa kami ng kaway ng aming mga kasamahan.	when the choppers we were riding rose, our companions even waved us goodbye.
<67>	Iba ang aking pakiramdam.	I felt differently.
<68>	Di ko maintindihan.	I could not understand.
<69>	Nagdasal ako.	I prayed.
<70>	Pinapanood ko ang malawak na kapatagan sa ibaba.	I watched the wide plains below.
<71>	Na-picture out ko ang aking bagong hunting ground.	I was able to picture out my new hunting ground.
<72>	Wala masyadong concealment maliban sa niyugan.	not much concealment apart from the coconut plantation.
<73>	Malawak ang marshland.	the marshland was wide.
<74>	Paano pag nandon ang labanan?	what if the fighting is there?
<75>	Mag 9:00am noon nang lumapag kami sa kampo ng 61st IB sa Shariff Aguak.	it was 9:00am then when we landed in the camp of the 61st IB in Shariff Aguak.
<76>	Sinalubong ako ng S3 na si Lt Ricky "Gary B" Bunayog, para magtungo sa kanilang briefing area.	I was welcomed by S3 Lieutenant Ricky "Gary B" Bunayog, to head to their briefing area.
<77>	Sa labas ng kanilang opisina, nakasalubong ko ang isa sa aking close na mistah na si Lt Ronaldo 'Sac' Sacatani, na noon ay piloto ng MG Attack helicopter.	outside their office, I came across one of my close squad members Lieutenant Ronaldo 'Sac' Sacatani, who back then was pilot of an MG Attack helicopter.
<78>	Magkasama kami ni Sac sa PMA Powerlifting Corps Squad at nakilalang 'magbabakal' sa academy dahil mahilig kaming mag-buhat ng daang kilong bakal tuwing athletic period.	Sac and I were together in the PMA powerlifting corps squad and known as the 'steel men' of the academy because we liked to carry hundreds of kilos of steel during athletic period.
<79>	Syempre, dahil mistah na nagkikita sa field, nagkakamustahan kami bago kami pumasok sa briefing room.	of course, because squad members seeing each other in the field, we greeted each other before entering the briefing room.
<80>	Di ko makalimutan ang kanyang kantyaw: "Bok, mabangis ka talaga. Ngayon ko lang nalaman na ganyan makipag-away ang mga mandirigmang Rangers. May suot pang alahas at ang bango-bango mo pa!"	I cannot forget his teasing: "Bok, you really are wild. only today I learned that warrior rangers fought like that. even wearing jewelry and you smell really good!"
<81>	Tameme ako.	I was speechless.
<82>	Hirap nga naman ipaliwanag.	it was difficult to explain.
<83>	Ako lang ang naka-Black Suit sa panahong iyon.	I was the only one wearing black suit at that time.
<84>	Naka-BDA naman ang mga buddies ko.	my buddies were wearing BDA.
<85>	"Bok, kami ang makabagong Musang.	"Bok, we are the modern Musang.
<86>	Pang-gyera na, pang-mall pa!	for war, for the mall too!
<87>	Ooops, wag mo kong pabayaan sa baba habang tinutulungan ko ang tropang na-ambush!"	oops, do not abandon us below while I am helping the ambushed troop!"
