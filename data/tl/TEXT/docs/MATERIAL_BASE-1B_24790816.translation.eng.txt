<17>	Wala pa siyang ideya kung ano’ng istorya ang ibibigay sa kanya ni Mother Lily at Roselle Monteverde, kung sino ang magiging direktor niya at kung sinu-sino ang makakasama niya, pero alam niyang malaki ang magagawa nito sa kanyang career.	he has no idea what story will be given to him by Mother Lily and Roselle Monteverde, who his director will be and who the people he would be with, but he knows this will do a lot for his career.
<18>	Kaya, habang naghihintay pa siya, patuloy raw muna niyang pagagandahin ang kanyang katawan, at tuloy pa rin ang kanyang workshops para mas lalo pang ma-develop ang kanyang acting skills.	so, while he is still waiting, he will continuously work on his body, and he will continue his workshops in order to develop even further his acting skills.
