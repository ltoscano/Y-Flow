<10>	Sa orihinal na idea ito ay patungkol sa kalaban na natalo sa labanan.	in the original idea, this refers to the enemy who lost in battle.
<11>	Halimbawa, pagkatapos ng isang matagumpay ng 4th Scout Ranger Company na pinamunuan ni Sgt Sabellina sa Davao, ito ang sinasabi ng mga sundalo sa NPA: 'Ayan, dahil ayaw nyo mag-surender, na-Ranger tuloy kayo!	for example, after one success of the 4th Scout Ranger Company led by Sergeant Sabellina in Davao, this is what soldiers say to the NPA: "see, you won't surrender so you encountered a Ranger!"

<18>	At dahil sa kanyang pananalita, isang maskuladong Ranger ang galit na galit na nagkompronta sa kanya at sabi: "Damuho ka porke non-Ranger ka, ano palagay mo sa aming mga Rangers, magnanakaw?	and because of what he said, one muscular Ranger angrily confronted him and said: "you brute! just because you're a non-Ranger what do you think of us Rangers? thieves?
<19>	Suntukan na lang!".	let's just box!".
