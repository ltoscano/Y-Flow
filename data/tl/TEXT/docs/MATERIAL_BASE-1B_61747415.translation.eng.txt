<3>	Mistulang hindi kinagat ni Davao City ­Mayor Rodrigo Duterte ang rebelasyon ng kanyang anak na si Sara Duterte na biktima ito ng panggagahasa.	seems that Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte did not take the revelation of his daughter Sara Duterte that she was a rape victim.
<4>	Sa social media account nito, sinabi ni Sara na “Not a joke.	in her social media account, Sara said, "not a joke.

<6>	Finally said it.	finally said it.
<7>	Good morning.”	good morning."
<8>	Pinaniniwalaang gina­wa ni Sara ang pahayag upang mapigilan ang galit ng publiko sa kanyang ama, dahil sa pagbibiro nitong “dapat nauna ang ­Mayor sa pila” sa pangga­gahasa sa Australyanang ­misyonaryong si Jacqueline Hamil.	it is believed that Sara made the statement to stop the anger of the public towards her father for joking, "the mayor should be the first in queue" in raping Jacqueline Hamil by an Australian missionary.
<9>	Diretso namang sinabi ni Duterte na hindi siya naniniwala sa sinasabi ng anak na si Sara.	Duterte directly said that he does not believe what her daughter Sara said.
<10>	Imposible daw na mangyari ito dahil may baril si Sara.	this is impossible to happen because Sara has a gun.
<11>	“She can’t be raped; she carries a gun,” sabi ng mayor.	"she can't be raped, she carries a gun," the mayor said.
<12>	Sa kanyang talumpati sa University of Visayas ay sinabi pa ni Duterte na “drama queen” ang kanyang anak kaya’t nasabi niya ang ganoong bagay.	in his speech in the University of Visayas, Duterte said that his daughter is a drama queen so she tells that kind of thing.
<13>	Tu­mang­gi ring humingi ng sorry si Duterte sa mga salitang binitiwan niya tungkol kay Hamil.	Duterte refused to ask for a sorry for the words he uttered about Hamil.
