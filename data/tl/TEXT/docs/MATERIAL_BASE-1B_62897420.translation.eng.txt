<1>	KASINUNGALINGAN NA NAMAN BA, PNOY?	is it another lie, PNoy?
<2>	ANG TAONG SINUNGALING AY KAPATID NG MAGNANAKAW!	a liar is a sibling of a thief!
<3>	Isang kasabihan na paulit-ulit at totoo.	a repetitive saying but real.
<4>	Sa pagdalo ni Benigno Simeon Aquino 3 (BSA3) sa nagdaang Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines (FOCAP) na inilabas sa Peoples’ Television at inere sa iba’t ibang himpilan ng radyo, buong tikas na ipinagyabang niya ang nagawa ng kanyang administras-yon.	in the attendance of Benigno Simeon Aquino 3 (BSA3) in the past Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines (FOCAP) released in the People's Television and aired in different radio station, with all his strength, he boasted what his administration has done.
<5>	Pinakamakulay raw ang pakikibaka ng kanyang rehimen sa korapsyon(?).	the struggle of his regime against corruption is the most colorful (?).
<6>	Tinanong siya ng mga Filipino at foreign journalist tungkol sa isyu ng korapsyon at ang kaso ng Luneta siege, tatlong taon na ang nakararaan.	he was asked by Filipino and foreign journalists about the issue on corruption and the case of the Luneta siege, three years had passed.
<7>	Unahin natin ang naging usa-pan nina Noynoy at opisyal ng China na si China Premier Li Kequiang.	let us take first what Noynoy and an official from China, China Premier Li Kequiang have discussed.
<8>	Sagot ni PNoy sa kung pinag-usapan ba nila ng lider ng China ang tungkol sa nangyari sa Luneta noong dumalo sila sa Southeast Asia Economic Leaders’ Forum na ginawa sa Brunei, HINDI RAW.	PNoy's answer if they he had talked with the leader of China about what happened in Luneta when they attended the Southeast Asia Economic Leaders' Forum held in Brunei, they had not.
<9>	Anak ng pitumpu’t pitong-puting-tupa naman.	child of seventy-seven white sheep.
<10>	Hayan, nagalit ang Chinese leaders at sinabihan siya (Noynoy) na ubod ng sinungaling!	there, the Chinese leaders are mad and called him (Noynoy) as full of lies!
<11>	Mismong si China Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying ang nagpatotoo na nag-usap sina Aquino at Kequiang tungkol sa paglutas sa Hong Kong issue.	even China Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hua Chunying himself have confirmed that indeed Aquino and Kequiang discussed in solving the Hong Kong issue.
<12>	Ano ba ito BSA3?	what is this, BSA3?
<13>	Ukol naman sa isyu ng pagbaka sa korapsyon, ipinagyabang ni Noynoy na unti-unti raw ay nakikita na ang liwanag para mawala nang lubusan ang korapsyon sa bansa.	about the issue of fighting against corruption, Noynoy boasted that light is slowly seen to totally dispel the corruption in the country.
<14>	Makakasuhan, mako-convict at makukulong ang mga umubos daw sa kaban ng bayan –noong panahon ni GLORIA MACAPAGAL-ARROYO.	those who emptied out the treasury of the nation - in the time of Gloria Macapagal - Arroyo - will be filed a case, convicted and jailed.
<15>	Sa FOCAP niya rin ginawa ang kasinungalingang ito.	he also did this lies at FOCAP.
<16>	Nang ibulgar ni Senador Jinggoy Estrada ang pabuya na P50 milyon sa bawat senador na bumoto para ma-impeach si dating Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona, una ay “deny-to-death” ang mga kapwa senador, pati na ang 188 kongresistang buwaya.	when Senator Jinggoy Estrada exposed the P50 million reward for each senator to vote to impeach the former Supreme Court Justice Renato Corona, at first, his co-senators denied it to death, as well as the 188 crocodile congress people.
<17>	Hindi totoo, sabi ni BSA3.	not true, BSA3 said.
<18>	Pero lumabas ang lahat matapos magsalita si Budget Secretary Butch Abad na bahagi lang daw iyon ng Priority De-velopment Acceleration Fund (PDAF) sa tulong ng Disbursement Allocation Fund (DAP).	but everything is exposed after Budget Secretary Butch Abad spoke that it was part of the Priority Development Acceleration Fund (PDAF) with the help of the Disbursement Allocation Fund (DAP).
<19>	Alam ng bayan ang ukol sa PDAF o pork barrel pero ang DAP, ano ‘yun?	the country knows about PDAF or pork barrel but DAP, what is that?
<20>	Habang ipinagtatanggol nina Drilon, Abad at PNoy (DAP) na maayos at ligal daw ang bagong “gatasan” ng Malacañang, nanguna sa pagpalag dito sina constitutionalist Joaquin Bernas, Prof. Benjamin Diokno, Prof. Leonor Briones, lalo na sina ex-Senador Joker Arroyo at Ping Lacson na nagsitanggap din daw ng pork barrel mula sa DAP.	while Drilon, Abad, and PNoy defended that it (DAP) is proper and the new "milking" scheme of the Malacañang is illegal, the constitutionalists Joaquin Bernas, Professor Benjamin Diokno and Professor Leonor Briones have initially revolted against this, especially ex-Senator Joker Arroyo and Ping Lacson who are said to have received the pork barrel from DAP.
<21>	Natural na magalit sina Joker at Ping dahil alam ng lahat na hindi sila kailanman kumuha ng kanilang pork barrel sapul pa nang maging senador sila!	it is natural for Joker and Ping to get mad because they know that they have not gotten their pork barrel since they became senators.
<22>	Tapos, buo raw ang P130 bilyong Malampaya Fund sa ilalim ng rehimeng Aquino.	and then, the P130 billion Malampaya Fund under the Aquino regime is intact.
<23>	Hayun, mismong ang National Treasurer ang nagsabi na said na, ubos na, wa na, nada, ang pondo rito.	there, even the National Treasurer himself has said that, it was spent out, nothing, no more funds here.
<24>	Saan ninyo dinala ang pondo?	where did you bring the funds?
<25>	Puro na lang ba kasinungalingan, PNoy?	is it all lies, PNoy?
