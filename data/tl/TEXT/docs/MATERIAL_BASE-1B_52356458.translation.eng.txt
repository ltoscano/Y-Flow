<3>	BAHAGYANG tumalbog ang siksik na tiyan ni Mario nang tamad na tamad niya itong idinantay sa harapan ng lababo.	Mario's big belly slightly bounced as he lazily laid it in front of the sink.
<4>	Nahuli na naman siyang kumain.	he was again the last one to finish eating.
<5>	Dismayado ang kaniyang mukha habang nanlalambot na tinitigan ang patung-patong na pinagkainan ng buong pamilya.	his face was dismayed as he softly looked at the stack of dishes finished by the whole family.
<6>	Hindi hiniwalay ang mga buto ng manok, kutsara’t tinidor at mga masesebong pinggan na pinagkapitan na ng natuyong sabaw ng kaldereta.	chicken bones were not segregated, spoon and forks, and greasy plates with dried soup of casserole sticking.
<7>	Dinagdagan pa ng mga baso sa gawing kaliwa ng lababo, pitsel na may tira pang isang basong iced tea at dalawang bandehado kung saan natuyo na ang mga latak na kanin at sabaw.	added with glasses on the left side of the sink, pitcher with remaining one glass of iced tea, and two platters where rice and soup has dried.
<8>	Mabuti at ang kaniyang ate na lamang ang inutusang mag-impis ng rice cooker at kalderong pinaglutuan ng ulam.	fortunately, his elder sister was tasked to clean off the rice cooker and pots used in cooking the viand.
<9>	Pinaliliguan ng kaniyang nanay ang bunso niyang kapatid habang lumabas na ng bahay ang kaniyang tatay, batid niyang dadalawin ang mga kumpare nito.	his mother took their youngest sister to bath while his father went out of the house, probably to visit his friends.
<10>	Siya na lamang ang naiwan sa kusina habang binabanlawan at sinasalansan ang mga kubyertos.	only he was left at the kitchen, washing and filing the utensils.
<11>	Buong bakasiyon na niya itong paulit-ulit na ginagawa.	he has been doing this repeatedly the entire vacation.
<12>	Sawang-sawa na siya.	he's already fed up.
<13>	Hindi na niya rin lubos akalain na maging sa araw ng Linggo, hindi siya patatawarin sa gawaing-bahay.	he didn't think that even on Sunday, he won't be given a breath from the household chores.
<14>	Ilang sandali pa, pinunasan na niya ang lababo gamit ang basahang nangingitim na sa kalumaan.	moments after, he wiped the sink using the rug, dark from being old.
<15>	Iniwanan niyang bukas ang salaan na lalagyan ng mga pinagligpitan at tumakbo palabas ng bahay.	he left the rack of dishes open, and ran outside the house.
<16>	Basa nang kaunti ang laylayan ng kamiseta ni Mario dahil dito niya tinuyo ang kaniyang basang mga kamay bago lumabas sa tarangkahan.	the end of his shirt was a bit wet because he used it to dry his wet hands before he went out the gate.
<17>	Sa ilalim ng orkidyas na itinanim ng kaniyang nanay, nakaupo sa bangketa ang kaniyang matalik na kaibigang si Anton.	under the orchids his mother planted, his best friend, Anton, was sitting on the sidewalk.
<18>	Nakukuba na ito habang abala sa paglalaro ng Pokemon Go.	slouched, he was busy playing Pokemon Go.
<19>	Tanghali na subalit halatang bagong ligo si Anton sa basa nitong buhok at kalat-kalat na pulbos sa dibdib.	it was already noon, but it was obvious that Anton just had taken a bath because his hair was wet and powder was all over his chest.
<20>	Maaaninag sa suot nitong maluwag na t-shirt na may cartoon character ang kapayatan nito lalo na nang sumiksik si Mario upang makinood sa usong laro.	you can see from his big shirt, with cartoon character on it, that he's thin, especially when Mario crammed to his side to watch the trending game.
<21>	“Tapos ka nang magligpit ‘no?” tanong ni Anton habang patuloy sa paglalaro.	"you're done cleaning up, right?" asked Anton while as he continues to play.
<22>	Walang imik si Mario.	Mario didn't respond.
<23>	Yamot na kinamot niya ang kaniyang ulo at ikinunot ang noo habang bahagyang nakapikit ang mata dahil sa tumatalbog na sikat ng araw sa aspalto.	he irritatingly scratched his head and wrinkled his forehead while slightly closing his eyes from the scorching heat of the sun on the asphalt.
<24>	Inilingan niya ang inalok ng kaniyang kalaro na Skyflakes na mukhang siya ring tanging tanghalian nito.	he declined the offered Skyflakes of his playmate which looked like was his only lunch.
<25>	“Tara sa bahay, maglaro na tayo ng Diner Dash!” anyaya ni Anton.	"let's go to our house, and play Diner Dash!" Anton invited.
<26>	Basa ang semento sa tapat ng bahay nina Anton dahil sa sinampay na mga basang damit.	the cement in front of Anton's house was wet from the hanged clothes.
<27>	Bumaba sila ng hagdan upang makapasok sa kanilang bahay.	they went down the stairs in order to come in the house.
<28>	Sa may gawing kaliwa, nakapuwesto ang kanilang telebisyon.	in the left corner, their television was displayed.
<29>	Nasa isang sulok ang tatay ni Anton na nakataas ang isang paa sa inuupuan at mag-isang kumakain.	Anton's father was in one corner, one leg on his chair, and eating alone.
<30>	Kinakamay nito ang adobong manok na nakalagay sa supot.	he was eating the chicken marinade in the bag using his bare hands.
<31>	Sa munting sala, salitan sila paglalaro sa tablet ang magkaibigan.	in the small living room, the friends were playing the tablet alternately.
<32>	Manghang-mangha si Mario at naisip na sana kasimbilis niyang maghugas ng pinggan ang babaeng karakter sa Diner Dash.	Mario was really amazed, and wished that he could wash the dishes as fast as the character in Diner Dash.
<33>	Sana simbilis lang ng isang pitik at naligpitan na ang mga hugasin na pinggan pagkatapos kumain.	hopefully, as fast as one snap, the dishes used after meals are cleaned.
<34>	Ilang sandali pa at napasigaw sa tuwa sina Mario at Anton dahil natapos nila ang isang level ng laro.	moments after, Mario and Anton were shouting with joy because they finished one level of the game.
<35>	Napatingala si Anton sa kaniyang pagkakayuko sa tablet nang marinig niya ang boses ng kaniyang nanay mula sa eskinita.	Anton looked up from his tablet when he heard the voice of his mother from the alley.
<36>	“Antoooon!	"Antoooon!
<37>	Hugasan mo na ang pinagkainan natin.	wash the dishes we used.
<38>	Kaninang-kaninan na ‘yan!”	that was still from a while ago!"
<39>	Humangos si Anton sa lababo upang sundin ang kaniyang nanay.	Anton went to the sink to fetch his mom.
<40>	Halata ni Mario na takot itong mapagalitan at mapahiya sa harap niya.	Mario noticed that he's scared to be scolded and embarrassed in front of him.
<41>	Hindi pa tapos ni Mario sa isang level ng Diner Dash, tumabi na muli si Anton sa kaniya, basa pa ang kamay at hinihintay siyang matapos.	Mario still not finished with one level of Diner Dash, Anton came to his side, hands still wet, waiting for him to finish.
<42>	Hininto ni Mario ang paglalaro.	Mario stopped playing.
<43>	Inihaba niya ang kaniyang ang leeg at pinagmasdan ang bakanteng mesa at tuyong lababo.	he stretched his neck and looked at the cleaned table and dried sink.
<44>	Tatlong plastik na plato, dalawang baso, dalawang tinidor at isang kutsara ang nakasalansan sa salaan…	three plastic plates, two glasses, two forks, and one spoon were drained in the drainer.
<45>	“Tapos ka na agad?” pagtataka niya sa bilis ng kaibigan.	"you're finished already?" he wondered with how fast his friend was.
<46>	Tumango siya habang hinablot sa kaniya ang tablet.	he nodded as he snatched away the tablet.
<47>	“You Lose!”’	"you lose!"
<48>	mensahe ng Diner Dash.	said Diner Dash.
<49>	“Bakit ang bilis mong magligpit?”	"why were you able to clean up so fast?"
<50>	usisa ni Mario na may halong pagkakagulat.	Mario asked with a hint of surprise.
<51>	“Eh kaunti lang ang kinain namin eh,” sagot ni Anton na malapit nang ipanalo ang nilalaro.	"we only used a few dishes," answered Anton, almost finishing the game.
<52>	Tulad ng inaasahan, Skyflakes ang merienda ng magkaibigan.	just as expected, Skyflakes were the friends' snacks.
<53>	Kinahapunan, pagpasok ni Mario sa kanilang bahay, hinahanda na naman ang limang plato, pares ng kutsara’t tinidor, mga bandehado ng ulam, isang pitsel ng iced tea at limang baso sa mesa.	later that afternoon, as Mario came in his house, five plates, pairs of spoon and fork, platters of viand, one pitcher of iced tea, and five glasses were being prepared.
<54>	Pinaupo siya ng kaniyang nanay na bitbit na ang nilutong adobo mula sa kusina.	his mother told him to sit down as she brought the cooked marinade from the kitchen.
<55>	Isa, dalawa, tatlo…	one, two, three...
<56>	Binilang niya ang bawat plato at kubyertos na sasabunan niya pagkatapos ng hapunan.	he counted each plate and utensils that he'll wash after eating dinner.
<57>	Natunaw na agad ang Skyflakes na kinain nila ni Anton kanina.	the Skyflakes he ate at Anton's earlier were already digested.
<58>	Kumalam ang kaniyang sikmura at sa pagkakataong iyon, mas ginusto niyang dumoble ang kaniyang mga hugasin.	his stomach rumbled, and at that moment, he wanted to double the dishes he was going to wash.
<59>	“Kain na po tayo,” wika niya sa harap ng hapagkainan.	"let's eat," he said in front of the table.
