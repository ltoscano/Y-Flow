<5>	MARAMI ang nakakapansin na parang for cinematic purposes lang ang paglalambingan nina Alden Richards at Maine Mendoza sa Destined To Be Yours.	many has taken notice how the sweet gestures of Alden Richards and Maine Mendoza are for cinematic purposes only in Destined To Be Yours.
<6>	Malaki tuloy ang epekto nito sa mga manonood.	it has a huge effect for viewers.
<7>	Halata kasing walang feeling of love ang actor kay Maine.	it was obvious how the actor has no feelings of love for Maine.
<8>	May nagbubuyo sa dalaga na idilat ang mga mata at hanapin ang tunay na nagmamahal sa kanya..	many advised the young lady to open up her eyes and find someone who would truly love her.
<9>	Kung minsan mahirap paniwalaan na isang super pogi tulad ni Alden ay mamahalan ang dalaga.	sometimes it is hard to believe someone super handsome like Alden would love the young lady.
<10>	Hindi ng aba nagkaroon na ng halimbawa sa relasyong Erich Gonzales at Daniel Matsunaga na nauwi rin sa hiwalayan?	to give an example is the relationship between Erich Gonzales and Daniel Matsunaga, did it not also end in separation?
<11>	Hindi tumagal ang pag-iibigan ng dalawa.	the couple's love affair did not last.
<12>	Sa teleserye nina Alden at Maine, nabanggit ng mga televiewer na parang napanood na nila iyong pagsisibak ng kahoy at pag-igib ng tubig ni Alden.	in the television series of Alden and Maine, television viewers mentioned how they have already seen the wood chopping and water fetching of Alden.
<13>	Kaya hindi makatotohanan ang eksenang napanood.	the scene they have watched was unrealistic.
<14>	At paano masasabing matagal ng panahon ang kinukunang eksena eh kulay pula ang buhok ng nanay na ginagampanan ni Janice de Belen.	and how could they say that the scene was shot set during the old times when hair of the mother is dyed red, as played by Janice de Belen.
<15>	Iyon ay simbolo ng makabagong panahon.	it is a symbol of modern times.
