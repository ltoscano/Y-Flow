<3>	Si Rex at ang Kanyang Pamilya	Rex and his family
<4>	ni Apolinario Villalobos	by Apolinario Villalobos
<5>	Nagkurus ang landas namin ni Rex (ayaw niyang ipabanggit ang apelyido niya) sa 7-11 store, tapat ng Robinson’s-Imus.	Rex (whose surname he doesn't want to be mentioned) and I have crossed paths in a 7-11 store, across Robinson's-Imus.
<6>	Nagkakape ako noon habang hinihintay ko ang pagbukas ng mall kung saan naroon ang store ng computers na may magaling na technician na naging suki ko na, si Allen.	I was having coffee that time while waiting for the mall to open where there is a computer store with a skillful technician who I always go to, he's Allen.
<7>	Nang umagang yon, ang suot na pantalon at polo shirt ni Rex ay halatang hindi na-plantsa pero hindi naman gusot talaga, at ang sapatos na suot ay mumurahing rubberized na itim pero naka- medyas naman siya.	that morning, the pants and polo shirt worn by Rex were obviously not pressed but it was not really that crumpled, and the shoes he was wearing was a cheap rubberized black but he was wearing socks though.
<8>	Napansin kong nakatingin siya sa kape ko kaya inalok ko siya, at nang tumanggi ay tumayo pa rin ako upang ibili siya.	I noticed that he was looking at my coffee so I asked him to have some, and when he refused I still stood to buy him one.
<9>	Sa halip na inumin agad ang kape, medyo nahihiya pang nagtanong kung pwede daw akong magpasa sa kanya ng load dahil iti-text daw niya ang supervisor ng inaaplayan niyang grocery, bilang merchandiser.	Instead of readily drinking the coffee, he slightly was shy in asking if I can possibly pass him some load because he will be texting the supervisor of the grocery he applied at, as merchandiser.
<10>	Papasahan ko na sana pero nalaman kong Globe ang gamit niya at ako naman ay Smart kaya hindi puwede.	I was about to do the pass but I learned that he was using Globe and I was on Smart so it won't do.
<11>	Binigyan ko na lang siya ng sampung pisong pang-load.	I instead gave him ten pesos for loading.
<12>	Bago umalis upang magpa-load ay saka pa lang siya nagpakilala at iniwan din ang belt bag.	Before he left to do the loading is the only time he said who he was and also left his belt bag.
<13>	Nang makabalik pagkatapos magpa-load ay nag-text agad sa supervisor ng inaaplayan niya para i-confirm na darating siya.	Upon returning after doing the load, he readily texted the supervisor where he applied to confirm that he was coming.
<14>	Ipinagtapat niya na naglakad lang daw siya mula sa kubo nila sa isang bukid na malapit sa isang kilalang subdivision.	he confessed that he only walked from their hut in a farm that is near a popular subdivision.
<15>	Wala daw talaga siyang pera dahil ang kinita niya sa pagbenta ng ilang taling kangkong at talbos ng kamote sa palengke ng Imus, madaling araw pa lang ay ibinili niya ng dalawang kilong bigas at apat na pirasong tuyo para may makain ang dalawa niyang kapatid bago pumasok sa eskwela….	he really doesn't have money because his earnings from selling several bundles of swamp cabbage and sweet potato tops in Imus market, from early dawn he already used to buy two kilos of rice and four pieces of dried herring so his two siblings will have something to eat before they go to school...
<16>	siya ay hindi na nag-almusal para may matirang kanin at ulam sa nanay niyang maysakit.	he didn't have breakfast so there will be leftover rice and viand for his mother who is sick.
<17>	Ang natirang barya ay ibinigay niya sa kanyang nanay para maipon at maipambili ng gamot.	The remaining coins he gave to his mother to save and use for buying medicine.
<18>	Bago daw umalis ay naglaga na rin siya ng talbos ng kamote para pandagdag sa inihaw na tuyo – almusal ng kanyang nanay.	Before he left he also boiled sweet potato tops to add to the grilled dried herring - breakfast of his mother.
<19>	Sa nabili niyang apat na tuyo, bale tig-isa sila at ang share niya ay kakainin niya sa tanghalian.	in the four dried herring he bought, they will have one each and he will eat his share for lunch.
<20>	Ang pambayad sana sa pagpa-repair ng laptop ko ay ibinigay ko na lang sa kanya at sinabihan ko siyang kapag natanggap sa trabaho ay ipagpatuloy niya ang ginagawa niyang pag-alaga sa mga kapatid at maysakit na nanay.	The payment meant for repairing my laptop I instead gave to him and I told him that if he is accepted for the job that he continue what he is doing caring for his siblings and sick mother.
<21>	Sa patuloy na pagkuwento niya, maliit pa lang daw sila ay iniwan na sila ng tatay nila, kaya kung saan-saan daw sila tumira, pati sa bangketa ng Baclaran hanggang makarating sila sa Imus kung saan ay nakakita sila ng matalahib na bukid.	As he continues to tell his story, even when they were small their father left them, so they lived from place to place, even by the sidewalk in Baclaran until they reached Imus where they found a grassy field.
<22>	Nagpaalam daw sila sa may-ari ng lupa bago naglinis ng lalagyan nila ng tulugan – actually, tarpaulin na nagsilbing bubong.	they asked permission from the landowner before cleaning a place for their bedding - actually, tarpaulin that served as roof.
<23>	Mga karton na palagi nilang dala ang higaan nila.	Cartons that they always brought were their bed.
<24>	Nakaipon ng mga kahoy ang dalawa niyang kapatid na namumulot ng junks kung walang pasok kaya unti-unti nilang nabuo ang kubo.	his two siblings who pick up junk when there are no classes were able to gather wood so they were slowly able to build their hut.
<25>	Noon ay tumambay daw siya sa Imus market upang magkargador at magtawag ng pasahero sa termina ng jeep.	back then he hung out at Imus market in order to become a porter and call for passengers at the jeep terminal.
<26>	Pinayagan silang magtanim ng gulay sa paligid at ang tubig na pandilig ay galing sa poso (deep well pump) ng may-ari ng lupa.	they were permitted to plant vegetables along the area and the water for sprinkling comes from the well (deep well pump) of the landowner.
<27>	Nang magkaroon ng pagkakataon ay nag-aral siya ng Refrigetation sa TESDA.	When the opportunity came he studied refrigeration at TESDA.
<28>	Ang TESDA certificate ang ginamit niya bilang patunay ng tinamong educational attainment sa pag-apply ng trabaho bilang merchandiser.	he used the TESDA certificate as proof of the educational attainment he obtained in applying for work as merchandiser.
<29>	Kahit matanggap bilang merchandiser, magtitinda pa rin daw siya ng kangkong at talbos ng kamote sa madaling araw.	even if accepted as merchandiser, he will still sell swamp cabbage and sweet potato tops in the early dawn.
<30>	Kung palarin, baka madadagdagan ang paninda niya ng kalabasa dahil ilang buwan na lang ay malalaki na ang bunga.	if lucky, maybe his merchandise may increase to include squash because in several months the fruits will be bigger.
<31>	Nag-usap na daw sila ng mga kapatid niya kung paano silang makatulong sa pag-ani ng mga talbos tuwing hapon na ibebenta naman niya sa madaling araw.	he and his siblings already spoke on how they would be able to help in harvesting the tops every afternoon that will then be sold in the early dawn.
<32>	Ang dalawa niyang kapatid ay sa isang public school na nasa tabi ng LTO-Imus, nag-aaral…naglalakad sila sa pagpasok at pag-uwi.	his two siblings study in a public school that is near LTO-Imus. they walk going to class and back home.
<33>	Si Rex ay 23 years old, sinundan siya ng 9 na taong gulang na kapatid na lalaki at ang bunsong babae ay 7 years old naman…ang nanay naman nila ay 52 years old.	Rex is 23 years old, followed by his 9 year old brother and the baby sister is 7 years old... their mother is 52 years old.
<34>	Nangako akong papasyalan ko sila dahil alam ko naman ang binanggit niyang bukid.	I promised to visit them because I know the field he mentioned anyway.
<35>	Kung ang KARAMIHAN MAN LANG SANA ng mga kabataang Pilipino ay tulad nina Rex at mga kapatid niya, SANA AY WALANG GAANONG PROBLEMA ang ating bansa….	if only majority of the Filipino youth are like Rex and his siblings, our country may not have that many problems...
