<1>	Dressing Formation: My 1st day as a PMA plebe	dressing formation: my 1st day as a PMA plebe.
<2>	Ang aking unang araw bilang isang plebo ay isa sa milestones ng aking military career na hindi ko makakalimutan.	my first day as a plebe is one of the milestones of my military career that I will not forget.
<3>	Malamig ang ihip ng hangin noong ika-1 ng Abril 1990 ngunit napakainit ng aking katawan dahil sa matinding pagod na dulot ng aming reception ceremony.	the breeze was cool on the 1st of April 1990 but my body was very hot because of severe exhaustion caused by our reception ceremony.
<4>	Tila matatapang ang lahat ng mga kadete na nakatalaga sa aking grupo.	all the cadets assigned to my group seem to be brave.
<5>	Nandidilat ang mga mata at panay pasigaw sa pagbibigay ng kadami-daming instructions.	their eyes were wide open and were often shouting when giving numerous instructions.
<6>	"Simula ngayon, kayo ay tatawaging Plebo!"	"starting today, you will be called plebes!"
<7>	"Bawal kayong mag-Tagalog kundi English sa lahat ng panahon na makipag-usap sa mga seniors."	"you are not allowed to speak in Tagalog, but in English, at all times when speaking to seniors."
<8>	Sa sobrang 'war schock' ay panay "Yes seeerrr!" na sigaw ang aming isinasagot.	in our utmost "war shock", we often answered, "yes sir!", with a shout.
<9>	Lumalabas ang ugat sa aming leeg at galing sa ilalim ng dibdib ang pagpalabas ng boses para mas malakas.	the vein on our necks would bulge and our voices would come from below the chest to be louder.
<10>	Ang aking grupo ay tinatawag na squad at binubuo ng 6 na plebo, isang Yearling (2nd year cadet) at isang Squad Leader.	my group was called a squad and is formed by 6 plebes, one yearling (2nd year cadet) and one squad leader.
<11>	Nagmartsa kami patungo sa aming barracks area na kung tatawagin ay New Cadet Battalion (NCBn) para maghanda para sa aming pinakaunang hapunan na kung tawagin sa cadet lingo ay 'mess'.	we marched towards our barracks area, which is called New Cadet Battalion (NCBn), to prepare for our very first dinner, which is called "mess" in cadet lingo.
<12>	Napakaraming bawal ang itinuro sa amin.	many restrictions were taught to us.
<13>	Kapag nasa formation area o kaya ay mag-martsa ay bawal ang makipag-usap sa kapwa kadete.	when in the formation area or when marching, it is forbidden to speak to fellow cadets.
<14>	No rolling of eyeballs.	no rolling of eyeballs.
<15>	No moving in ranks.	no moving in ranks.
<16>	Mahigpit ang bilin ng aming SL (squad leader) na parang naghahayag ng Code of Kalantiaw.	the instructions of our SL (squad leader) were strict, as if stating the Code of Kalantiaw.
<17>	Nakakatakot ang kanyang babala.	his warning was scary.
<18>	"Bawal sa inyo ang mag-connive.	"it is forbidden for you to connive.
<19>	Pag me mahuli kami, lips to lips ang abutin nyo!"	if we catch anyone, you will kiss each other on the lips!"
<20>	Pagdating sa aming kwarto, nakita ko na magkakasama kaming lahat doon at magkatabi ang aming double-deck na higaan na kung tawagin ay 'bunks'.	upon arriving in our room, I saw that we were all together in there and our double-deck beds, called "bunks", were next to each other.
<21>	Meron kaming tig-iisang duffel bag na puno ng mga uniporme at mga accessories.	we each had one duffel bag that is full of uniforms and accessories.
<22>	Me maraming underwear, handkerchiefs, shirts, sweatshirts, jogging pants at marami pang iba.	there were many pieces of underwear, handkerchiefs, shirts, sweatshirts, jogging pants and many more.
<23>	Ang pinakauna naming uniporme ay olive drab na kung tatawagin ay Drill B uniform, ka-partner ito ng combat boots na tila ay nag-aantay na aming suotin.	our very first uniform was an olive drab, which was called a drill B uniform, partnered with combat boots that seem to be waiting to be worn by us.
<24>	"Iyan ang inyong mga gamit bilang kadete.	"those are your things as cadets.
<25>	Alagaan ang inyong gamit at huwag kayong magkalat. Sa lahat ng panahon ay maayos ang pagkatupi ng kagamitan at malinis ang inyong kwarto," sabi ni SL.	take care of your things and do not make a mess. how your things are folded should be neat and your room should be clean at all times," said SL.
<26>	Kanya-kanya na kaming kuha ng aming uniporme nang kami ay binigyan ng kautusan na kumuha ng mga damit na kailangan para sa next duty, ang 'Evening Mess'.	we individually took our uniforms when we were given an order to get clothes that are needed for the next duty, the "evening mess".
<27>	"Gentlemen, lahat ng duties natin ay inoorasan.	"gentlemen, all our duties are being timed.
<28>	Hindi pwede ang pabagal-bagal at pabakla-bakla kumilos," ang bilin ni SL na matalim ang paningin lagi sa amin.	it is not allowed to be slow and to move like a gay boy," instructed by SL, who was always looking at us sharply.
<29>	"Ngayon, gusto kong suotin nyong lahat ang inyong bath attire sa loob ng 10 counts!"	"now, I want all of you to wear your bath attire in 10 counts!"
<30>	"One! ....... two! ..... three..."	"one! ... two! ... three..."
<31>	Kanya-kanya na kaming hubad ng aming damit sibilyan at kandarapang isuot ang bathrobe at tuwalya.	each of us took off our civilian clothes and scrambled to wear the bathrobe and towel.
<32>	Napatawa si SL dahil sa kanya-kanya naming porma.	SL laughed because of our individual appearances.
<33>	Paano ba naman kasi, pati pagtali ng bathrobe, pagdala ng tuwalya at sipilyo at kailangang nasa tama ayon sa kautusan.	how could this be when even in tying the bathrobe, bringing the towel and toothbrush, needs to be in order according to the command.
<34>	"Ang tuwalya ay naka-fold ng kalahati at nakaipit sa kaliwang braso. Bitbitin ang sipilyo at sabon sa kanang kamay!"	"the towel is folded in half and is tucked under the left arm. carry the toothbrush and soap on the right hand!"
<35>	Ganon na lang ang kalituhan namin kasi lahat pala ng gagawin ay merong 'rules'.	that was how confused we were because it seemed like all activities had "rules".
<36>	Sinunod namin ito lahat at parati ay pasigaw ang sagot na "Yessssssssssss seeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!"	we followed all of them and always shouted out our answer, "yes sir!".
<37>	"Plebos, we have 20 mins remaining before our first evening mess formation. Gusto ko makaligo kayo sa loob ng 10 counts!"	"plebes, we have 20 minutes remaining before our first evening mess formation. I want you to take a bath in 10 counts!"
<38>	Nalalabuan ako sa mga sinabi nya.	I was confused with what he said.
<39>	Paano ka nga naman makaligo sa loob ng sampung bilang?	how could you take a bath in just ten counts?
<40>	Parang natulala ako sa pag-iisip nang narinig ko uli ang boses ni SL.	I was lost in my thoughts when I heard the voice of SL again.
<41>	"In 10 counts, nakaligo na kayo! 10! ...... 9! .... 8! "	"in 10 counts, you are already done bathing! 10! ... 9! ... 8!"
<42>	Kandarapa kami lahat.	we all scrambled to our feet.
<43>	Nang naisabit ko ang aking tuwalya at bathrobe, gumawa na ako ng diskarte.	once I have hung my towel and bathrobe, I already made my strategy.
<44>	Sa kaliwang kamay ay ang tabo na nagbubuhos ng tubig.	on my left hand is the dipper that pours water.
<45>	Sa kanang kamay ay gamit sa pag-toothbrush.	the right hand is used for brushing my teeth.
<46>	Sinigurado kong mabasa buong katawan at makapag-sipilyo na rin.	I made sure that my whole body got wet and to brush my teeth too.
<47>	Umaalingawngaw ang boses ni SL sa harap ng aming kwarto.	the voice of SL echoed in front of our room.
<48>	"7! ..... 6! .... 5! .."	"7! ... 6! ... 5! ..."
<49>	Nasa numerong 4 pa lang, naisuot ko na ang bathrobe sabay karipas ng takbo pabalik sa harap ng nakangising si SL.	at only number 4, I was already able to wear the bathrobe while making a mad dash back in front of SL who was grinning.
<50>	"Tsuuuunnnnn!"	"tsuuuunnnnn!"
<51>	Ewan ko ano yong command nya.	I don't know what his command is.
<52>	Busy ako sa pag-aayos ng aking bathrobe habang humihingal pa.	I was busy fixing my bathrobe while still panting.
<53>	Ang ibig sabihin pala don ay "Attention!".	apparently, it meant "attention!".
<54>	Shortcut pala yon!	it was a shortcut!
<55>	Malay ko ba don?	how would I know that?
<56>	Sorry na lang sa mga nahuli kong mistah.	sorry for the classmates that I caught.
<57>	Meron na agad kaparusahan sa kanila.	there is already a punishment for them.
<58>	Ganon pala ang tinatawag na 'dressing formation' sa militar.	so that's what you call a "dressing formation" in the military.
<59>	Nakakainis ngunit nakakapawis.	it is irritating but makes one sweat.
