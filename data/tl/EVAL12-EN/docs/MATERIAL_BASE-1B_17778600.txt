It is not only four.

It is not enough.

You are mad because of the continuous increase in the price of oil and LPG, we are very angry because most of us continue to forget the high price of goods, instead, they are very happy because many of us continue to forget their system, instead, they are very happy because of lack of excessive profit.

You are angry but as long as you are just mad, we are angry but we will be silent in a corner, we are mad, not enough for us to just smirked, or not enough, just laugh at one corner, when you are not moving.

There are many people who are angry, but they do not really show their anger to the system of a few people who is organized, but not yet ready, because the majority who does not want to happen is not going to happen whatever we do.

Let us study the society together with our anger at a wide and direct action that will respond to our problems, so we should not rush in one goal, in one direction, to replace the rotten system that continues to be replaced with our integrity and personality.

We should be dependent on each other and the citizens should act promptly, but they will only take action that they would be able to see each other, if they will be able to meet the leadership of the workers, and welfare of the whole country is always in your mind.

Anger is not enough, we can only change our situation if we will take action, one of the first concrete steps is to enumerate our confidence towards one direction, going to our dreams, towards our dreams, towards the success of our goal.

Our every step towards dizziness!
