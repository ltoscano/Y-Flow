It has been four years since he was elected in Malaca√±ang for four years, but instead of solving the problem he found, you just do not know, Mister Aquino, if you arrived in front of you, you are all thinking about what you have left, your improvement?
The MRT and PNR, lined up because of your negligence, all the arrogance of your personnel or friends who are seated, they can clearly see that they do not have abilities.
Before, even if the MRT or PNR is being ruined and given quick action, most of the many passengers, there are no problems or complaints against your friends and friends, why don't you ask Jun Abaya.
