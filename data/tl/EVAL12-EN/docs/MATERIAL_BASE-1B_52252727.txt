Drilon force to force it.
By Al-Santiago July 26, 2016 - Senate President Franklin Drilon made the return of Manny Pacquiao in November 6 (Phl's time) in Las Vegas.
Because Pacquiao is already a senator and Drilon is the boss of Pacman.
It is hard for Drilon to be poor, if he prohibited Pacquiao, many will be angry at first that there are many fans of Pacquiao.

Their belief has no death because Pacquiao can still do.
Next to that are the prisoners and members of Team Pacquiao, because every time Pacquiao has a fight, they will also earn money because they are included in the preparation, whoever has the most weight and after falling out money.
And of course, it is prohibited to kill freedom under democracy.

Drilon knows that if he did not allow Pacman, he needs to have criticisms.
As senator, it's because Pacquiao has considered the state that almost cannot be mistaken, that is why it is like that.
Just imagine, in almost 400 session in the Congress, he only attended the congressman for almost 5 times but is he angry?
If there is still a proof, it is just a proof that when he won a senator on May 9, it will be released by the country.
Pacquiao is 37 years old and we can still see that when he called Tim Bradley last April.
Therefore, remember: When Drilon refuse, he will take care of the country.
