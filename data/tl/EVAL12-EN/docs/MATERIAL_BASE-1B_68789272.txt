Cavite are perfect for the gambling and statement of the Pope.

We admire the statement of the new Pope, Pope Francis regarding the issue of birthcontrol "and for gay people.
Why it seems that the decision of other officials of the church is very fast if the issue is about being gay, tomboy or transgender.
Especially for the issue of "one responsible" or controlling the gave birth, it is as if you have no chance in heaven if you are a gay, tomboy.
That if you don't believe that your parents should be given importance to the difference of their plea, it is just enough to tell you that you are followers of Satan!
Pope Francis is right that it is not right to be the price, lesson or belief of the church will serve as an obstacle to happen the unity of God's blessing.
Because what is happening here to us is that it's as if the church is looking for a way on how to raise the ta from this belief.
So, there are already many who went away from being a Catholic.
Hopefully, the bishops and scrutinize this have become aware of the statement of the Pope.
Hopefully, let us just allow the "Reproductive Health Law."
Hopefully, they will let each parents have their own freedom to plan their families and the type of the economic Planning because it will be used.
Hopefully they use the church and his lessons to fully achieve unity and not disunity.
And hopefully, hopefully, it would be better to stop being a hypocrite of the bishops and scrutinize it!
Hopefully.
Entice the President.
