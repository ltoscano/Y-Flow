Filipino was snubbed.

Congratulations!

The condition of the Philippine Contingent is lead to killing the situation of the Philippine Contingent is a murder of the United Nations Security Adviser in Golan Heights, Syria.
It's because it has reached Golan Heights, the destruction of the territory of Al Noni) and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) and the Islamic State of Iraq is Syria, although they are both fighting the government of Syria, and Israel.
It is part of Syria to Golan Heights but grabbed and conquered by Israel so that their attack will not be used in the end, the UN is conquered by the UN about the goal of not to be used by Israel and Syria in their own war.
There is a total of 342 Filipino soldiers in this place and the position of the 71 soldiers are in the middle of the fight while we are writing this after it was attacked by Al Nihonggo and jailed them.
The Filipinos followed the Filipinos but they did not give in and the weapons not given up were not given up, like what the Al Nenita, which is why they had an attack yesterday.
As early as now, our government also clarified that Filipinos should not give in and instead, they should stand up even if they will still risk their lives.
The government is set to speed up the soldiers on the coming October but what if they take a face in the war before the said month came and not only to the Israel and Syria, which is the real reason for their visit there?
As early as now, the government needs to explain to the country, especially to the families of the soldiers, in case there will happen and the Filipinos there will have a life.
One more thing that should be watched, make sure, the effect of the start of the war of Filipinos in Golan Heights in the Philippines, especially in Mindanao and in our ocean, and this is experienced by the terrorists in Golan Heights, all the bombing of the terrorists in Golan Heights.
