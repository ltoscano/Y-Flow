If there is an opportunity in the modern history of Metro Manila, almost everyone does not stop all the tasks, and he does not say every time the Holy Pope - the majority of the Catholic Church, and even if the majority of the Catholic Church still remains Catholic, and there is still a Catholic love for the Pope.
It was only four times when Papa went to the Philippines only once, I had no idea that his visit. Last 1995 was, like I was able to join the World Youth Day in Manila, but they were not able to join the World Youth Day in Manila, but according to the PNP, he was temporarily stopped in college.
We have been waiting for more than three hours in front of Papal visit to Taft Avenue for a few minutes before Pope John Paul II's window, which is more than anyone, who almost died from the Lord Nazarene, "Our Lady of Penafrancia in Hala, and many others, especially in a life of the Pope.

Despite the statement made by Pope Francis, the millions of Filipinos will not stop the millions of Filipinos who are hoping to earn money from the media, including the Papal visit, including the Papal visit, and using the rights of Pope Francis, this is an opportunity for them to declare this message.
It is not enough to be a holy and have a glimpse at the holiness of this world and have also active for the changes in this world.
