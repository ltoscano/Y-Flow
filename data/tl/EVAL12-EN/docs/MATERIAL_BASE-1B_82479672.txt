The military personnel added to US President Barack Obama in Iraq to exterminate the members of the terrorist Islamic State (SAF) group.
In the report of Almujemar azine, the US personnel sent the US again wherein at present there have been 4,650 US personnel who are guarding the security of innocent civilians in Iraq.
According to Obama, his personnel will help so that the security in the said country will be further strengthened even if Defense Secretary Ashton Carl said that the goal of the additional force to recover from the hands of the Islamic State of Iraq is the capital of Mosul.
Most of the soldiers are going to build a building in Baugio which is at a distance of 64 kilometers from Mosul.
Obama earlier sent to 250 soldiers in Syria.
