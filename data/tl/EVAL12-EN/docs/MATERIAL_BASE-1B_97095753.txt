Remove Commissioner David.

PNoy has made it a habit to face the complaints about the failure of his personnel.
Just like what he did recently in 72nd Avenue of the Bureau of Immigration, where he was in front of the alleged collar to escape the country the siblings, Reyes of Palawan.
The truth is, it is obvious that there is a coldness in Reyes, and some officials of the BI.
But it would be better if PNoy will just give it back to them and file a case against those who are guilty.
Or maybe they will be removed from being Commissioner Ricardo David.
Instead of reading the whole department, even the good employees are jealous of shame.
"Of this, judicial system, the poor for a president who will not experience the father of the house is not known how to be treated as the father of the country!
For an effective father, who is the only child who has sinned, "who are being punished, and in the right way.
He did not respond to the majority that even his innocent people are jealous in the tomfoolery of the few!
