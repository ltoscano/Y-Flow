What are you doing?
"Why did you not call me on the telephone without being able to talk to that.
Ah, it's because what I call here is that I am cleaning here in the house that's why I am cleaning the house so I thought that I am living in the house, because I think they are hungry; we are proud to each other.
Here is the root of me while I was cleaning the news that I have heard a lot in me, I have a big heart, that's why I have a big head and were talkative on what time you came.
It was eleven o'clock when it was eleven o'clock in your sister.
Ah, we are able to look at each other; we are able to go to school; she said yes to his story.
Not here in the living room, I have been in a living room here in the room, because we were able to leave the room, because they are not stupid; why are you not why there are food stall.
The trouble is your older sibling that is too much.
Later talk to them.
