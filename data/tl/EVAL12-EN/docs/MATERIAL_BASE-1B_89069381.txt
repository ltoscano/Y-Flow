One of my favorite joke is about the pictures being caught by his wife who was on top of another woman and said my husband was naked in front of the wife and said yes, I was not. "
This is the former explanation of Vice President Jojo Binay on the national TV last Thursday about the accusations against him by corruption especially in the destruction of Makati parking building.
Jojo's explanation was outside the nose, maybe even if he will believe what he is saying, if I will just be silent and let the case of plunder, which was filed against him and his former mayor of Makati, will lead to him.
Onse, in-time, I admired Jojo Binay that's why when he wanted to be fired by DILG Secretary Ronnie Puno when he removed his position as mayor of Makati, I ran to Makati City Hall in order to offer him.
Because it was the time of President Gloria M. Arroyo and we and Jojo should have resigned from GMA because of the severe corruption under his leadership.
If I just knew that Jojo and GMA are of bird of the very feasted in, I should not waste time because Puno should have pushed through the removal of Jojo as mayor of Makati.

According to the World Bank, the widespread corruption in the Philippines is due to the lack of chemicals, millions of our countrymen were in different countries for the livelihood of the family.
That is why because of the incessant stealing of money from the people, many Filipinos are suffering now or becoming an OFW, and now that Jojo is still the Presidential Adviser on OFWs), it should be Jojo Binay and your family so that we can go home to the Philippines. "
