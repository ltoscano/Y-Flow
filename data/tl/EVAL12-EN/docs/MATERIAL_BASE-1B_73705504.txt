Youngest shameless!

The youngest turtle (first Sunday of Adosto) there is a family of the turtle who planned to reconcile with them for a few months that they have prepared for a few months that is why they left for a place for them to look for their food and things.

They arrived in an island after six months because they called them for almost a month in cleaning and they were shocked because they had forgotten that they were not able to carry salt and if there were no salt for the turtle, he was not complete.

They look at the youngest turtle, "they said," because you did not go home for a month, but before he left, I did not go home for a month, but before that I did not go home to get salt, "now that I did not go home to get salt," this the first week of the budget that we have to prepare.

For sure, Jesus will come back to the two things that we can make as the preparation of our lives too much, but when our lives are too fast, we seem to be very fast on the whole day in life, that's why we don't want to be in a trip to a vehicle.

Complicated.

They buy things that may be implemented or cheap, but it is not needed so when it comes to this house, it is only hidden to make life simple and be ready for the arrival of Jesus!
