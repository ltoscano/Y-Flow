Coming from the same place.

The 17 City director of DILG in Metro Manila was a visitor of Marikina City last day to observe a "enious," of our City Council, led by Vice Mayor Jose Fabian, an adult.
Aside from this, he / she said that this is the only time of Marikina and even DILG Secretary Mar Roxas was impressed by it.
In Marikina City, tablet is used by the councilor for their Council session that they are reading all the documents that they need for the session this day.
This is in the initiative of Kon. Jojo Banzon that made sure that his project will push through.
After failing to meet the city director of the Department of Marikina LGU), one of them was asked how Marikina maintained its projects and how can they ensure that the new employees and residents can be assured.
"Condolences for home," this is the answer of a department head.
Marikina is lucky because all of us came from the same group, almost all of us passed through BF or Bayani Fernando and to MCPS or Marides Fernando.
Perhaps, perhaps, some of the people in Marikina did not know that our current Mayor Del R. de Guzman got a big part in the changes in Marikina as vice mayor of BF as vice mayor of BF as vice mayor of BF as vice mayor of BF as vice mayor, he was the one to happen to the progress of our city.
That's why although he / she feels awkward when he won last 2010 against the candidate of the Fernando Mayor Ernest Andres (who was also with Mayor Del Rosario in the councils and of Kabayani).
Even though many of the department cabinet are worried that they will be replaced or put in an aura and will not happen again, most of those that makes our city have no changed and are the manager of our city.
Our mayor is not only humane, he also knows how to be indebted to the people he has been with in the administration for a few decades.
