All sorts of store.

All sorts of store.

Only in the Philippines!

We are sad, Filipinos, when they want to start business, they think of the construction of various stores, not only one, and what is amazing is the same with the contents they are selling, "I think they are the same," are they still earning money? "

The reason for this is because we Filipinos want to get the profit from what we are doing so we immediately want to see the fruit of our hard work.

It is not bad, but sometimes we are putting it in faith and we just want it to be a result of all our prayers, we want to give immediately what we are asking for us to create.

In good news, this is also the age of many Israelites before that they want us to see the proof that Jesus will be able to see the proof that Jesus will be able to see and see what Christ is doing and from here he is going to decide when Christ is doing.

The Lord is not in a hurry as he has a plan and his plan is the best plan in fact that it has been a long time before he sent her son and at the right time, Jesus gave it first.

Even if Jesus is not easy, it is not easy to pass by a baby, being a child until now, she is not in a hurry to return to his return.

The challenge to us is for us to understand the plan of God for us not to be impatient if our prayers and personal plans of God's God's time will be answered, to God our prayers, to avoid our prayers.
