Witnesses to witnesses:
Jimmy and Jimmy Cantos or July 23, 2016, even if Senator Manny Pacquiao does not deny, his return to the ring will continue.
This is from his fer, Bob Arum who said that the Pambansang Kamao has already returned to November 5, and the fight will be done in Thomas and Mabog Center in Las Vegas.
November 5 is the date of the fight because the Senate is on recess of those times, the question is how he will compete in the training while the Senate is still absent, like what he did in the House as congressman of Sarangani?
Thomas and Maker is inside the University of Nevada in Las Vegas and it is not new for Pacman for two times that it has been fought back in the said location and defeated by the former last January 2006 and the second is on November of the same year.
What is being talked about now is that, according to Arum, he is going to fight the fight of Pacman in his last fight versus three names were mentioned by Arum: Jessie Vargas which is an welterweight champion, Viktor Postanes and a light-welterweight champion, Zheng Rongfeng.
Do you hear this name? "Vargas has a record at 27-1 while both have no losses in 28 fights with Postanes and Crawford.
Postigo also has a former partner of Pacman when he is set to fight Crawford on Sunday at the MGM Grand, and who will win will probably take care of Pacman's opponent.
All the negotiation have is done by Arum and he is undergoing a report to Michael Icz, the Canadian adviser of Pacman.
When will it come from Pacman himself that he will go back to the ring after he wants to express how many months have passed since he has already retired in boxing, in his last fight, Pacman defeated Timothy Bradley.
