The cooperation in Congress was a message of the Congress.

The National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) wants the most hot cooperation and greeting to the various generations of the Philippines, we will focus on our strong support to the citizens of the Philippines, we are again what we continue to support for the national release and real democracy.

We praise for your hard work to enumerate everything that is for defense, the workers, and who are the citizens who will be the citizens under the flag of SONAs, and fix their desire to become instruments for freedom and democracy for the citizens as Basque and democracy.

The Filipino people themselves are in life and their separate fighting for the national release and real democracy as well as they have a lot of abuse and abuse of the local government and poor people who are suffering and suffering from the human-prone US.

Despite the natural resources of the country, the big majority of the Filipinos are living under the limit of poverty because the local government and the foreign businessmen who are headed by the US will be taken into a huge wealth and the local government fund which is headed by the citizens of a decent livelihood.

To make this way that he would stop this kind of basic needs in the Philippines in different parts of the economy of the Philippines, the wage increase of the economy of the Philippines, together with the disputed territory of the farmers of the Philippines, together with the agricultural sector in the field of the Philippines, together with the agricultural sector in the field of the Philippines.

The Liberal Party of the Philippines is confident, and the 15-year-old organization of NDFP) will be disappointed with any attempt of a live-headed by the US-Aquino to weaken and destroy the Saligang Batas of the whole country, and the national success of the Pambansang Kamao in the whole country.

We are hoping that the strict unity between the disputed Filipino people and the citizens of Basque is going to be more effective in choosing this unity and true democracy if we hope that the SONAs will be effective in taking advantage of this unity and improvement of the struggle for a free country as Basque.
