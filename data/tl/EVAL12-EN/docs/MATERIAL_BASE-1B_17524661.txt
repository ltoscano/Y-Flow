In opinion.

It is a good thing that the medical community is preparing particularly the doctors to illegal drugs in the country.
It is said that this is not good for illness but temporarily remove the pain in the body because he has a high arch.
Even Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Leila de Lima did not agree to make marijuana.
If these attacks are legal, the Philippines will surely smell the smell of marijuana from the Philippines, especially the addicts and criminals.
So if there are lawmakers who are pushing to make marijuana, addicts, addicts, addicts, and irritated!
