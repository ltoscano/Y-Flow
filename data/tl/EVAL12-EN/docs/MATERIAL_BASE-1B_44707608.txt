New BPLO chief in Las Piñas City "paper in the afternoon, is it only in the afternoon," said Mayor Nene Aguilar!

It seems that the local government unit (LGU) of Las Piñas City of Las Piñas City has just been wasted in the new chief of Bureau of Permits, Licensing Office (BPLO), Atty. Glenda Lucena.
"Because it is possible that Atty. Glenda M." that is according to some employees of the Las Piñas City Hall.
According to him, he is really not really the same age as BPLO chief because there is really a real "traslacion" and he is the one who owns which, "I am going to approve the applicants who want to travel in Las Piñas.
It seems that even Mayor Officer 3 Vergel "Nene" will be sent back to his administration, which is why even the former BPLO chief, who said to be involved in beating up, or corruption, has been dismissed by the former system in the said office.
According to the investor and local businessmen who get their position in Las Piñas, their application goes to a aytono.
If we are not mistaken by Miss Bess Masangkay, the older sibling of Mayor Nene, who is losing a mayor in Muntinlupa City, is not mistaken.
Walis in fact?
That's why no matter how hard the effort of Attorney Glenda to fix the system of BPLO), he will not be implemented thoroughly because there is more powerful in him even if he is the chief.
A businessman who was arrested with us that will not be less than 1 million pesos, will not be less than 1 million pesos "will not be less than 1 million money" to get a position in the market there in Las Piñas City.
Tsk, tsk, is it true that Mayor Nene Aguilar is true?
"What is Atty." Glenda in BPLO) if Madam Bess Masangenos to the real "boss" and disconcerting there? "
