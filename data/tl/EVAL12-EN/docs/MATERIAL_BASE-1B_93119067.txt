He went there in Luzon.
Why is it in Luzon?
That you have been waiting for a long time.
Very kind; we were able to look straight and, of course I was able to understand that Uncle Janno are very pitiful; I don't understand even if I am not yet called, "do not even know if I have talked to it.
I thought you were the only one I can talk to me, i me, okay, "do you think you were able to hear each other; we have read that we have read," I have read.
Ah, it rains, like this yes.
I do not hear yes, but what happened to you is the largest ball.
But it is not like a few moments like this, that's why, we have talked to Boy, we talked with Boy calling me.
They have only made a headache to anyone who are in different kinds of interests; I still need money to send money to each other.
I am confused; we are even asking me earlier, but I am still asking for a while ago when I had a lot of money at the same morning, he / she said that he / she was having a lot of money, he / she was really his / her own children, which is why he / she was really with my own godchildren.
Yes, Boyet, we call to us so that I can't talk to him because I am too much.
In my opinion, he / she said that he / she didn't go to me, he said, he didn't go to me on Saturday when I did not give to me, she said she was not given to me, he said that he was not given to what happened to what Aiza said that she was not given to him / her, which was why I saw him.
Yes, but he / she allegedly took your way there and that's also what I left, that I did not even buy.
That is what I told me now, do you repeat, isn't it given to you first in Malabon?
What I wanted was changed, that is why we were fighting in the work of Botchok (it is it that it was in his work to do that, that's why the size of the amount given to him / her.
We are very noisy; he / she is very full; what sometimes, when you pay, you have to go to school first.
You went to me, Boys.
