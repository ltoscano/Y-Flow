The "Express" by Madame SoJ Leila, 52!

Postmaster by Jerry Yap.
On May 27, 2015.
In Bulabugin.

It was said that Justice Secretary Leila de Lima could still jump.
"Like that, just a little bit of fire," I was able to jump immediately.
In short, he loves to look at and get on the new issue of the country.
Just like Davao City Mayor Rodrigo "Digong" Duterte, who is connected to the feared Davao Death Squad (DDS).
Well, buttons of Madam Secretary Leila de Lima suddenly exploded.
Hehehe!
As a result: He was attacked by social media.
"If you really have something to take responsibility, then he will not file a case.
Is it a few years if Chairperson the Commission on Human Rights (CHR), Madam Leila, and why is it that now that he has ill feelings?!
If the Secretary of DOJ is really good with his statement that resulted in the statement of the CHR (Commission on Human Rights), he has not been able to file a case against the wheelchair of the CHR (Commission on Human Rights) but until now he has not been able to file a case against the lawmakers and officials of the government who are part of the 3rd floor of PDAF case?
Why is it that until now we still don't have clarity on the Ampatuan massacre case?
"That is not the end of the anomaly in Bureau of Correction (BuCor)?
"Are the irregularities in the Bureau of Immigration (BI) that is why Secretary de Lima will make it happy?
"It seems that even if it seems to be" distinguished (equivalent), which is the cause of demote to the employees and officials of the BI, "Madam Leila also does not know!
Isn't it that what Madam Leila should pay attention to?
"Well, if his strategy is like that, it is a big points for Madam Secretary" that, especially since he is dreaming of becoming a senator.
However, he is just joking, if Madam Leila was really serious to run for senator, "he should try to file a case against Digong Duterte.
He will prove to the court so that his name will not have clarity.
What do you think, Madam Leila!
