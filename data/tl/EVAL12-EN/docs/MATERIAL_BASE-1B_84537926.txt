Bishop Teodoro Vanglement and father of San JU.

We are proud of the issue brought to us by many supporters of the Catholic Church, this is true: We are not trying hard to intrude and other religion because we believe in the freedom of choosing our faith.
But with the number of people affected and because they are not in faith but this aspect, we don't put a blind eye on the situation happening in Immaculate Conception Parish, Barretto, Olongapo City.
Classes were suspended because of Bishop Florentino, father, Rodel San Juan last November 2012 because of the alleged abuse of the priest that happened before and the priest has been returned to his position because most of them were taken to church in said church because majority of Father San Juan were able to go back to school.
The arguments of August was completely ignited when he disappeared from the computer of the church that contains many important information, and was given 10 days to explain why he should not be punished for a criminal case which was filed in the Olongapo City Prosecutors Office.
Bishop Lavilo also intervened and wrote a letter from his position, and if not, father, Father San Juan, will be suspended.
This is the truth: The parish priest is suffering because of the conflict but the catholic bishops conference of the Philippines (CBCP) who came closer to the Parish council Council (PPC) of Urkupina will not care about the individual made.
They both Bishop.
If father.
If Bishop Lavarez was the one ordered by Alcantara, he stole the use of the church.
Hey, wait for a first time, even if there is a basis, there is a basis for Bishop's allegation that he is like a fake "who will defend.
Forgive me but this is the truth!
