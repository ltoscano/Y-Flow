What is a contract that should be signed.
By Al G. Mendoza, September 21, 2016, it is only right to have a contract between the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) and the athletes.
That is the advocacy of PSC Chair Butch Ramirez.
His reason is simple, in the contract, those in the contract are already gone and the athletes who are in the national training are receiving monthly salary from the PSC.
In the new directive of Ramirez, the full training of the athletes under their cowards.
It is prohibited that sweating can be prohibited for planting and giving training as a violation of the regulations that they are paying for monthly income.
Of course, the greater punishment is the firing of training.
There is a long time that the policies of the PSC have been like that.
But everything is not too late, as long as a plan is meaningful, it should be implemented even if it has arrived.
The PSC is serious to strengthen our sports.

If we will not be that serious now, when will they get worse?
In the contract of the contract, the foundation of the victims will get stronger in the international airport.
It is time for the PSC to form the meaningful direction of the Philippine sports.
