Napoles has already surrendered to PNoy. Billion pesos is missing from the country's treasury and just goes to the pocket of a few.

Earlier, I have watched on television that Napoles seems to be a high member of the Judiciary as well as the question of many, but the story of many is that it started in a small container, but the story of the mother and father will lead to the pocket of mother and father.

A while ago when I went home, I rode a jeep with two students who rode a jeep when they gave them the change, they brought it to them, they returned to them, "their older brother was given to give in exchange.

You should give in exchange for six million pesos, but when I saw the children in front of the driver, it is better that the Philippines still has a chance to reach the bus, but when there are passengers who are ready to reach the bus, there is still hope that the Philippines will still stay in the Philippines.
