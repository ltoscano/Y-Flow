The senators who benefited from PDAF, where are the senators who benefited from PDAF?

The Department of Justice (DOJ) is now focused on Ruby Tuason after he returned P40 million last Friday because of the exchange of money sent to Senators Juan Ponce Enrile and Jinggoy Estrada, which was led by Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, aside from Enrile and Jinggoy Estrada, also involved with Senator Ramon Revilla Junior.
But according to Tuason, it seems that the earlier discovered by DOJ Sec. Leila de Lima and the former senator is buried and now aside from three senators, there are still senators who are involved in the PDAF scam, what happened to this discovered?
De Lima was first known after talking to Napoles at the Hospital of Makati where he was watching over the PDAF scam, which is why he confessed to be a state witness of Napoles, which is why de Lima said, the request of Napoles is still being studied.
The direct report is what Lacson said that 19 senators are involved in the scam, according to Lacson, he was surprised when he read President Aquino who benefited from the PDAF and all allies of the current administration, he was surprised when he read the contents of Napoles' affidavit.
Why do they not want to name the senators who are involved, it would be better if they will reveal their names so they would not be able to know it and the public might just make noise to investigate this until the whole truth will be investigated.
