Fat!

Fat (New Year) I was going to enter the room because I had a lot of things that I have given to the door even if my two hands were holding my hands, "why did I have to enter the door even if my two hands were holding my hands," why did I have to enter the door now?

However, I found out that it is needed to put my hand in order to enter.

I learned that my hand is enough for the tasks that I want to do all the things that I want to reach everything, but I want all the things that I want to reach him, but I want all the love to reach him, but this is not his life.

We Can an only daughter, "We Can an only daughter, (We Can, is an only child to be an affair with the Tantos).

We'll be touched as Are Benetas, "we, we were we" we, the part where the God will keep on top of it!
