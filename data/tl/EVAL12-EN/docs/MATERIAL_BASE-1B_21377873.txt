Straight at least.

When PNoy is running for President, many of us are hoping that he will resolve his promise that we will be given a clean and straight path.
We believed before that through this, there will also be a chance to progress our country which has long been admired by the past leaders.
Before, when the President was not able to finish his promised straight path, we believe and depend on him.
She still continues to make his promised straight path, but as long as he is slowly being noticed that he is just giving a ball.
As long as long, we can prove that his said campaign against corruption and only appropriate to his opponents in politics and not his allies and accomplices in his allies.
Just like the Metro Rail Transit (MRT) General Manager Al Vitangcol, who is exiled in his position in spite of his failure to walk by our MRT system, he was also accused by those who are going to serve the Czech Republic Act (WBC).
But it seems that Vitangcol was wearing a thick face because instead of resigning, he even climbed up to his position.
In South Korea, Chance is resigned from his duty even if it has nothing to do with the devastation of the SEA Games that caused more than 300 people.
That is how important of them is their integrity, something that is not in the character of PNoy, like this with Vitangcol.
When his name was implicated in his name, technical Education (TESDA) Secretary Joel Villanueva of the pork barrel scam of Janet Lim-Napoles, who will just leave PNoy.
The names of his companions also mentioned several times on the alleged corruption but the stupid gang of the frying pan-pan.
That is what "Tuwid na Daan" will be broken as long as you are his ally.
