A liar.

They are pointing at each other, the "liar" asked the president of the organization of private hospitals and the President of PhilHealth.
This is one of the big issues currently affecting our countrymen who are hoping for PhilHealth every time they need funds for treatment.
The complaints of our patients are said to be a lot of hospitals that are not received or recognize PhilHealth cards since it is said that there are more hospitals that are not being received by patients who are just receiving PhilHealth to pay for the expenses in the hospital.
The President said to the hospitals, because they are not paid for an accident and right in the time of PhilHealth, the hospitals said and it is not true that they have debt on them.
The conflict is not beneficial, if you think about it, the documents of the documents are about to know if PhilHealth or violating their duties to the citizens are the hospitals.
The big problem here is really the bad effect of our fellow countrymen, especially the poor, who are still caught up to teach them what they are suffering.
What is obvious is the failure of the health services of this system wherein PhilHealth is in the middle of some politicians who are even used for the pull of PhilHealth cards since now they are losing their use.
This should be done again, if the system of PhilHealth is right or not effective, the health services especially to our poor countrymen is very important, it is not possible to resolve the problem between PhilHealth and the hospitals.
And the government needs to look at any more effective system now that what is wrong in this current way is being implemented for the duty of the state to give assistance to the poor people who are needy.
They cannot only act on who is lying, both sides should immediately sit and look for a solution to the problems that serves as a burden to our countrymen.
