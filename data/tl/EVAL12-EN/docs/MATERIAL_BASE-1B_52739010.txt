He was able to explain on September 9, 2016 when President Rodrigo Duterte made his statement on President Barack Obama of the United States, he said he did not understand why Obama said that Obama did nothing wrong to him or to our country.
The result of this, Obama has already canceled his meeting with Duterte and was distressed as Duterte that he will not allow his kind of words and speech.

After a few hours, our President already asked for an apology to Obama and said he does not want to fight with the strongest country in the whole world, hopefully he does not want to fight with the strongest country in the whole world, that is why he said that he will be a basis of our relationship and relationship with another country.
What will be the possible implication in case the relationship of the Philippines and the United States will finally be destroyed, we should remember that our families are living together in the United States because if that happens, there are a few thousands of Filipinos who are living in the United States, and if that happened, there are a few thousands of Filipinos who have lost jobs in our country.
The important lesson here is that Duterte should think first before he talks, he can give his opinion in proper way and when he does not curse the words to be spoken to our country, especially to the millions of Filipinos who have a job in another country, especially to millions of Filipinos who have a job.
