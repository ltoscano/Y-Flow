Witnesses, it is unlikely to happen in the PBA.
Jimmy and Jimmy Cantos or June 14, 20161079 share on Facebook tweet that means that the NBA never rule out.
This is about the day of Doctor GROs) imposed by the NBA yesterday which was the reason why the latter was not able to catch the latter in Game 5 of finals this morning against the Cleveland Cavaliers.
The foul smell was called Green because of the numerous motion that he did in the fourth period against LeBron James, Green and tried to gather the star of Golden State while he was trying to stand up.
What Green did, it is believed that his hand was to avoid and hit the sensitive parts of the body of James because of this, the two had shouting and called a double foul odor.
But this is not the reason why the NBA was suspended by the NBA but the reason was because it was his four-four foul smell in the league.
Chel-million system is called by the NBA and the intention is for them not to have a foul odor in the game.
We know that the suspension of Green will be a big challenge to the Warriors the day of Green because she goes with James. Eiffel Tower, as they say, Green of James.
The question now is who is the players of Golden State that can be done by Green in Game 5.
I called a friend yesterday and asked if there's like this kind of rule in PBA and the friend said, he did not remember that there is a rule.

He also said, every time the foul odor of a players has a corresponding amount, and while the foul odor of one athlete is increasing, the amount is increasing.

A lot of P5,000 is started with P5,000.
But instead of suspended a players in the playoffs, especially in the finals, it seems that it is unlikely to happen in the PBA.
During the time of Chito Salomens as commissioner, any celebration will be imposed on a players while it is playing in the finals, the game will be imposed so that a team will not be destroyed and the fight will not be destroyed and given a good show.
In NBA, they do not care.
