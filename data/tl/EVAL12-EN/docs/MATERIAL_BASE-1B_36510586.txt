Reversed.

On the first day of the overseas absentee voting in Hong Kong, the Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chair Sixto Brillantes will no longer be able to deny the reason why there are times that they are changed in OV, such as a sign that a person has changed.
But the more fiery emotion is what he said that the politicians will not increase in our country the budget for PV, which is why the number of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) will not increase.
Will the case be the basis of the right to vote the issue if there are still a lot of people or not in vote, when the principle is given, the principle is given to respect the state of human rights to vote?
Again, it seems that our OFWs are looking back to our OFWs as to why the number of those who are joining the V V will increase and the failure to undergo the budget will increase because of the lack of budget.
The filipino masses is the fault of why there are only few cases of players abroad and to why the voting was limited and far from where the OFW's sins were limited and far from where they are not reaching the embassy of the embassy of Regulations and voting in the legislative chamber.
OFW's fault is why they are losing interest in voting because there is no real change coming from the promises of the politicians themselves now that they will be saved from the rights of OFWs.
This is no difference with asking of crystal-Tetuan, and to his parents why the tragedy happened to her, or they chose to blame an OFW because they were put in a clean situation.
It is the fault of the masses.
The common victims of their rights are the ones who are guilty.
The mind of Aquino and the selfish politicians are really reversed.
