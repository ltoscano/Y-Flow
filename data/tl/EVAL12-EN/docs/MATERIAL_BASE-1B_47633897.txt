SONA 2014, for sure.

Just a few more sleep, what we will hear from President Benigno Aquino 3rd on his fourth State of the Nation Address (SONA) in Congress), there is a doubt that Aquino will not do in Congress because there is a threat of trouble?
Let's remember all of his lines in the past SONA, you are the one who told the country, did you fulfill something or happen to the secret or what happened to his enemies in politics and his clan.
The low level of our economy, society, economy and politics are looking for things and said by Bira 3.
Is it happy that the lives of the citizens are happy, right?
In the recent World Economic Cooperation, Aquino said that the Philippines has already recovered, especially in the field of economy, the citizens are full, and will be seen open to the greater miracle of the economy in his hands.
You are the people who say, the city is the price of rice, garlic, onions and the similar products of oil, that is why the price of oil is low, which is the price of oil, that is why the prices of oil and streets are destroyed, like that?
And in the coming 2014 SONA, what would be the concern for Pres. Noynoy?
Is there no poor Filipino?
If that is what he will say in his 2014 SONA, let us ask when we get the thickness of MUbers which is why he continues to be deceived!
