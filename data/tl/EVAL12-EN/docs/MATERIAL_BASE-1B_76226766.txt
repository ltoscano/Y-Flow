Issue on libel and FOI.

Just a few more sleep and the six-year administration of PNoy will be finished.
But even if even if he gets mad, there is still no change in his promises and has been used to it!
One of these is his absenteeism which if there are no corrupt, there is no poor! "
Is PNoy still not able to know that poverty in our country is not only widespread, rather it becomes worse, and it means that this is not only widespread in the government, but this has become worse now!
The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (FOI) is also included in the promise of Noynoy when he was still campaigning.
Because he believes that the FOI is going to help a lot to stop smoking from the government.
But when he became president, PNoy is one of those opposing the FOI.
King-mother, is it because he is one of those who are going to steal or possibly steal, what is painful, the FOI is not able to help a lot in order to reveal the corruption of the government, the "interruptible load of libel."
This means, they do not want to take the people's transactions with the government to protect the transactions in the government, which if the revelation is done through the internet, a bigger punishment is allocated!
Just like this in the steps of many senators to fully dismiss the case of libel, isn't it not right to take action on the lower chamber that is headed by "puppy of PNoy, Speaker Belmonte?
Because of that, we believe, that the implementation of the FOI is, which will not happen in the case of libel which will not happen in the time now, "Abby" and our government in suppressing corruption!
And while "Abaca," the people are still in choosing the appointed leader, we will remain in corruption!
