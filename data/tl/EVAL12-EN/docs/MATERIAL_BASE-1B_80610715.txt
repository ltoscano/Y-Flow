Commissioner Ruffy Biazon and Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim are.

Bureau of Customs Commissioner Ruffy Biazon and Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim Lim are two different people but are both officials of the government under the administration of Pres. Benigno Aquino III, which is why they are traversing the "straight path."
Biazon, former lawmaker, is not tired of fighting against corrupt officials and personnel of his agency who are members of his agency who are members of the country, while Lim, also did not stop their repression of cruelty and foolishness of the police in his jurisdiction.
Biazon has also tried for several times, which is why these are repeatedly doing the smuggling of contraband, however, in the end, they fail in attempting to gather using the personnel of the government.
The crocodile thought that Biazon will surrender and his loyal personnel just like those assigned in Ninoy Aquino International Airport (BOC-NAIA) and up to Task Force (BSP) and to "Task Force Karin," they will only be loose.
It was then that the victims were wrong when they tried to steal in drug smuggling and divers the other day (Sunday) in NAIA.
Because Customs Police District chief George Aliangan said to be alert, NAIA District Commander Col. Marlon Aleda to confiscated the contraband found in spite of the violation of Republic Act 8550 or the law which aims to improve the care of the fishes and other sea.
The said to be smuggled only for P75,000 and will be able to cross the cauldron, Taiwan, and lit up in China Airlines flight CI-712.
Because of this, aside from July when he tried to sneak the said eel that reached P2 million, it can be said that Biazon will really be different from the past chief of BOC.
What our protagonist is doing is not a campaign to start saving but that, that the members of the current government should be completed.
