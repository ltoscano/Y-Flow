Ice: P5 million for Medina? By Al-June.
Jularanne Calment of Germany is not preparing for Medina, 11-5, 11-6, 11-7, to make our 16-year-old medals in the Olympics for those with disabilities.
"I offered this to our country," Medina was born with Vicio, Medina used Ping's Ping "as an ally" in the bitter part of fate.
And with his taste of faith in the Lord and guidance of his father, who became a National player of Ping Lacson, Medina was the 14-year-year in 2012.
Last year, he is the removal of the ASEAN summit in Singapore.
"In God, it's nothing wrong, terrible," Medina said after he posted the power of Adeline Dampayan in the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
Just like the cave I was attending to the Rio Olympics, the success of Medina was not expected.
Even Senator Cynthia Villar has forgiven Medina: "Your win is proof that there is no limit to each person to live!"
The question: If Diaz has 7.5 million pesos in his silver program, Medina has also given P5 million pesos to the government for every Olympic Games?

Isn't it that a Olympics is also in the Olympics?
What should Manny Pacquiao say?
No Digong only wants to answer.
