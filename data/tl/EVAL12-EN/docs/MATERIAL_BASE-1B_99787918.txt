In!

The event that we did not get is the right to be the host of 2019 the World Cup.
The honor was given to China last week.
The truth is, his dream to defeat China on the bidding is really more than a month, if there are a lot of poverty taking of the game, that is why many of them were held in the Olympics eight years ago.
But it seems that in every city, there is a big commission where the game can be held.
Here in us, big players will be counted in Metro Manila to hold the game in GAA Arena and Araneta Coliseum, the Cuneta Astrodome, and Ninoy Aquino Stadium is small.
The Philippine Arena is a bit far but it is good and big.
They said that there are two decades that they will go down but they will only be built on by one near the GAA while one is in Cebu.
Of course, China will go up if there is a financial issue.
But this can be followed by Manny V. Pangilinan, but we know the feelings of MVP just as basketball and Philippine pride.
The true people who will talk about are the addicts of Filipinos in basketball, it is definite that all of the games on 2019 the FIBA World Cup will surely watch that, if we will be held there, we will not know if the Pambansang Kamao will be filled with China in 2019.
If he loves basketball, it is used in basketball that was used as a signal number 1 tablet for choosing the host, the Philippines has no losses.
