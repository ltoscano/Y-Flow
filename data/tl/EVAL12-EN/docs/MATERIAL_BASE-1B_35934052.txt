The Lord tasted.

Ginger Conejero - Father Edwards B. Liwag.

The Lord is compared to His words to increase the rain and flow of snow in the land to make the Word of God to make the words of God and blossom again of our hearts and think of a prosperous land.
The word of God is like the owner of the farmer who fell down on the road and turned a knife that fell from a thin ground and fell on a thin ground and strangled him.
The insult towards our life is giving a lot of meaning to our life, God is spreading us by hope, this is not lucky that this is the plan of God for us, so we should not neglect it.
Second, this is the course of God's words to gather all the Bible, read the Bible, let us talk to us, praise, thank you and ask forgiveness from the Lord our plans to teach us his plans in our lives.
Prayer is a way for us to socialize with Him for every moment of our life.
