Bangsamoro, Philippines?

President Benigno Aquino III will almost jump out of joy after the final example of the government of the Republic of the Philippines (RP) and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in Malaysia recently.
For the crazy dog to teach them their allies in the Congress, they said that they will be supported by the expected Bangsamoro State in the region of Mindanao who have said that what happened to the Malaysia and MILF will be considered as the peace of Aquino in the country and the citizens.
We have written on my position for a long time on the peace talks, who really wanted to live in a complicated town or community?, until now, my questions against G. Noynoy continued about his peace agreement to the MILF.
If ever the Congress can pass the Bangalibis as to be a free state inside the state of the Philippines, what is their race?
If they will have a police inside their international state, do they have control of the national police and Armed Forces of the Philippines, what is the truth in his own state, or only one of the questions that Aquino should answer to the Moro State and I am going crazy.
We do not want our filipinos to share that, I am fine in being out of conservation in the government for the improvement of the Bangsamoro Basic Law in the whole country, and if it can be considered that the Bangsamoro Basic Law would be considered, it is wrong for a few mistakes!
OPPEP head Teresita Deles and G. Aquino should be honest in this issue that they should not allow the muslims and involved sector in Mindanao to not say that the indigenous people or other natives are in Mindanao who are not Muslims.
We also advised that in the peace talks, it is back to study the whole agreement, "the bureaucracy of nature, should be clear, if there is a blessing that you will get, do not give it to all the new amount of connotation.
We are still in one race even if we have different kinds of belief, especially your faith!
