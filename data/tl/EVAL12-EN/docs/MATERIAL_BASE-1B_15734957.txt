What happened to Binay?

What if Jojo Binay becomes president and Vice President Chiz Escudero will be president in the next election?
That is the headache of President Noynoy and his Liberal Party when our government has changed.
The bet of Noynoy is Mar Roxas for presidency, but many are worried that Mar will not win for many reasons.
It has been two years and in the election and in the estimation of others, Binay would resign as the Cabinet member of Noynoy to be the true and active member of the Opposition against President Noynoy and the Liberal Party.
History of wedlock, to be a point, to be a case in Times Square because this is always what is happening in our country.
Ferdinand Marcos joined the Nacionalista Party which became an enemy of his-tandem Fernando Lopez, Vice President and Secretary of Agriculture.
Because of a dispute, Lopez resigned from the agricultural sector.
When Cory Aquino ran for President.
When Fidel Ramos is the president, Erap Estrada became Vice President and led the anti-crime commission.
The two of them are now separated and Erap is the ones who took place at Joe de Venecia, followers of Ramos.
These politicians were not carrying any of them as vice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo who was a member of the cabinet, after two years, he became an ally, "Gloria, and he attacked Erap.
Noynoy added that he asked Gloria Macapagal and aside from that, Noynoy still chosen Vice President Binay that he wants to run for President.
If Binay will win, the outcome of Noynoy and the members of the Liberal Party is also in jail?
