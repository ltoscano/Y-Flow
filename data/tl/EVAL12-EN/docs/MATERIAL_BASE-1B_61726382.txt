The one who is about to cross the issue of diets for the issue.

In the news that came out, now we proved that what President Noynoy Aquino is saying is true and his allies who are involved in the P10-billion pork barrel scam are telling the real issues that were assigned to "pork barrel queen" Janet Lim-Napoles and his accomplices in Congress and Executive.
They are saying that their sins in DAP were intense, while the real issue that gives them down and this is the pork barrel scam, which according to Benhur Luy, is part of the Priority Development Assistance Fund which is where they have not left a cent for the projects which should be sold by the funds.
In the testimony of Luy, the crying of PDAF only is 50 percent, which is given to the lawmakers that is given to Napoles, while 10 percent is going to be given to the Chief of Staff of lawmakers due to an equivalent value of an NGO used in the project.
An issue has been disconcerting to PNoy, about DAP, that the Palace will not allow the government to add up to other budget or projects because it is prohibited by the Supreme Court to use the President to use the government funds to increase the funds of money.
