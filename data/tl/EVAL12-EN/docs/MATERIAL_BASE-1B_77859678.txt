We can do it: Support for Jun Lobo.
According to Keh's September 2, 2016, I was saddened by the news that the court will be put in jail by our enemies in La Salle College when he was still living with his family in La Salle Greenhills because of the threat in his life after he admitted the wrong and nonsense of his life after former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.
If we can remember, Loiz said that our government will lose more than 100 million dollars if this agreement will go through the side of the government of the Philippines and the country China.
Because of the heroism done by Loiz City, this agreement did not push through, but instead, the 100 million dollars in our country are safe, and instead, the other employees of our government and the ordinary citizens are going to reveal or fight the corruption.
They are going to have two minds now because they saw that when they fought the big people, they might go back to them and put them in the hands of the law, and who still continue to steal, they are still continuing to steal in the hands of the law and rules in our country.
Let us pray and support Jun Lobo and his family.

Let us show to him that he is not alone in the fight for the truth and for the future of our country, we should help the people like Loiz City so that there will be more strength to reveal the nonsense happening in our government.
