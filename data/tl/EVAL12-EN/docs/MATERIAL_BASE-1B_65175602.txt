Those who are going to say!

The typhoon Yolanda hit the anger of the typhoon Yolanda because after more than 100 days, most of them have no orderly house and their future is not known where it is going to.
The United Nations (UN) himself said that there is no need for help from our countrymen who are devastated by the typhoon.
It appears that the government is all talk about the alleged action he is doing to help the victims of the actual, our fellow countrymen in the Visayas Region continue to suffer.
The lack of proper house is that they can endure it but the lack of right food is very difficult, it is very difficult for the failures of the typhoon especially that they know it rained fish from different countries.
According to the UN, poverty and lack of food will possibly be drug pushers in a knife.
It was reported that the sex being picked up by other moments is that they can take advantage of women who are hungry and the offer of bastard women in exchange of selling of the body is painful but it seems that the government does not neglect it.
The government has a housing (SWS) but it will not be easier for the government's steps to choose the piles of house that is reported to be implemented.
As the housing czar, Vice President Jojo Binay, Vice President Jojo Binay should rule the construction of the housing project to the victims because he is an enemy of politics, DILG Secretary Mar Roxas are meddling and his position is no use, which is why he's only one of him.
DSWD does not have any use for the relief operations where many victims will not go through, so many have died and get sick.
That's why our fellow countrymen in Leyte and Samar are saying, "they are all" members of the Aquino government so they can help them.
Don't look contemptuous, what means is no use, no matter or other words, the Aquino administration is useless.
