BE with Dacer July 27, 2016, a incident of murder of an official of the District Anti-Illegal Drugs-Special Action Force (DAID-Illegal Drugs) of the Quezon City Police District (QCPD) was washed away.
The kidnappers were killed in a buy-bust operation of Senior Inspector Ramon Castillo, who was said to be involved in the prevalence of illegal drugs.
The official in the buy-bust operation that was laid out in Barangay Greater Fairview, Quezon City two days ago at dawn and estimated to be 50 more policemen who are involved in the operation of illegal drugs were confiscated by the police who are involved in illegal drugs or were not giving protection to drug lords.
The chief of police of QCPD admitted that Castillo has been working for a long time because it is known in the exchange of illegal drugs from those who are caught.
We know that all the issues about what happened between Castillo but what happened to us should serve as a wake up call to other members of our police who turned around and surrendered because it has not been involved in illegal drugs because this is the only thing that President Rodrigo Duterte has to do.
For a long time, you might be together in making this foolish thing but in my opinion, you need to repeat it just like what President Duterte is saying because you will really love us.
The trend is not only in QCPD but also in many stations and district of our police in the whole country, so hopefully you will be able to bring back to their help because this government is going to bring back to illegal drugs and suppressing crimes.
