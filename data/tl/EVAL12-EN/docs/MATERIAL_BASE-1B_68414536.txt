The gift of our countrymen for the coming Christmas is now full.
There are a lot of gifts from the scattered bazaars and markets in different corners of the country.
But it is important to be able to choose the gift they will buy because according to the group EcoWaste Coalition (Eker), the said group is more active in buying toys to ensure the safety of the public, especially the children who will receive the Christmas present.
Along with this, the Ekonomopuolos of "tanim-bala" Toda was launched for a campaign against Zero Harper, Zombies "which was released by toy guns to use and full of gifts at Christmas and New Year after it was discovered by the examination of 93 percent.
The group referred to the dangerous toys are the following: Batteries, shrimp paste, knives, coconut husk, which was a sack of Pokemon cards since a high increase was high.
The plastic bags that took place was also brought as well because it was pointed out and was carried away by the child as well as a pellet gun which might get blind.
It is also included in the list that wild boar was cut off in the list of crystal meth, Port Area; however, it is a mini-Billiard Tournament that could have been washed away by the children because they are small.
We are busy because there are groups that are watching this kind of products to ensure the safety of our people that they give importance to, especially the children.
That is why our plea is to remain in this kind of research because this is a big help for us to have a guidance for our giving presents.
The price should not be the primary basis for choosing the gift but let us also give one hundred percent away from any kind of chemical that will bring danger to our evil spirits.
