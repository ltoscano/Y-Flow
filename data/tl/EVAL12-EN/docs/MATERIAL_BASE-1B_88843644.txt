You are not worried, Mister President?

Thank you to Oscar Pineda, Cebu based on Elections Star Ngayon that it was Eleonore Schoenborn, Oscar Malapitan!
President Noynoy Aquino cannot hide his anger after he is asked by Kuyang Oscar, why it has been more than three months that the regime is still lacking in helping the victims of typhoon dear President or Yolanda.
I remember ex-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (PGMA) then.
Motel is the favorite gift of GMA at Ateneo but he was fired! It is also what happened to the former Agriculture Secretary Arthur Yap who almost took a bath in the public and was caught in the act and complaints because of the negligence of his work.
The question of Sun Star Ngayon is right, but there is a bigger disaster in the lives of the victims of typhoon Sendong and Pablo in Mindanao during the time of G. Aquino.
The president was wrong when he pointed out his officials on the calamities and told the media to analyze and read the data of agencies involved in helping the victims of calamities.
What, Mister President, if you are all being arrested and lies in their report?
One of those is the energy that serves as a burden to our fellow countrymen in Mindanao because the calamity they experience is severe, causing their economy to bring down their economy!
If you are not even going to the places destroyed by calamity, it is likely that until now, what you know is all wrong based on the report of your officials!
Is it true that you don't know, Mister President, the ones to be a decent and liar for the report to you by your personnel?
As said by the former President and Manila City Mayor Eat Estrada, "it is bad to lie down, maybe you will be hit by lightning!"
Well, if it is true that you don't know, Mister President, if it is true that you do not know and believe that you do not know and believe that it is just based on their liar, you should not wait for it even if there is a lot of students to remove them from!
