Forgive them.

The path to intimate conversation is forgiveness.

If we want to achieve the treatment of the Black Nazarene, it is important that we make sure that we have a sad experience in the past, and even if we continue to resolve us, we should continue to solve it so that we will not be harmed in our minds.

We need our relationship to be close, open, and honest, especially when we are carrying the heart and ability to forgive each other, we can't be able to give it to other people like this, we can't be able to give in to our hearts, we will not be able to give them your feelings for each other.

Any of us wants to have a very kind, meaningful, and pure friends must have a short time.
