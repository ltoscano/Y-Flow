It cannot be paint.

A few years have passed when I push forward to Quezon City the resurrection of the proper recognition and respect for "zebras." In the whole city.
What I noticed before is that it's as if it's as if you have given importance to the white cloth that they have given importance to.
Motorists should almost respect the Aspe, instead of stopping to give way for the crossing, they are still coordinating with the crossing.
It is very dangerous for children and elderly.
Last week, the plan of the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) was reported to be washed away by the Emergency Shelter Assistance or zebras.
According to the MMDA, this is their contribution to the Department of education for the opening of classes on this day, but it is good that MMDA is thinking, but paint?
As one of the agencies of the government, the government should understand the proper flow of traffic and make sure that the safety of the citizens on the streets, more than what the citizens should do is more than what the MMDA should do.
It is time to take a peek at and will build the law in relation to the irresponsible lane law.
What are the laws being referred to regarding why there are those who are whispering among the crowded places in the city and what the corresponding punishment are waiting for those who violate the law.
It is not enough to paint that the problem on the roads will worsen, the accidents related to those who are unemployed and without undisciplined bus drivers are not a joke, not a joke, the bad effects of being rude on Road, such as Midzfar Yuno Nu√±o.
It is a big disaster for the citizenry to focus on top of laws on the streets and the seemingly lack of ability of our authorities to stop the foul acts of this.
What is lacking is the urge to make the lower lane line, it is possible to paint the solution.
