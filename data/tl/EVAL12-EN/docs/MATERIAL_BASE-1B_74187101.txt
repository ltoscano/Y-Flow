I am still my birthday.

Maybe unknown to the knowledge of many that the Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) is also covered with controversy like many controversies involving some of our politicians now.
Yes, while we are worried about the Filipino movies every December, there was hidden grief and complaints of the people in the industry of making movies about the MMFF.
It's because the Commission on Audit (COA) is also investigating the MMFF because the money they earn during the Film Festival is considered as the money of the country which should be allocated for the industry of making movies.
The complaint of the industry of the industry is said to not really go to the movie industry because the real motive is not being followed because the real motive is not being followed is for the development and improvement of the Filipino masses.
What are the complaints and source of controversy?
According to the report of COA, most of the money from the MMFF have not been used properly.
Some of an example of wrong use of money by the MMFF, according to COA report, is the spending of funds for the things that are not for the cinemas, which is why it is possible that the former MMFF Chairman, Libingan ng mga Bayani, and sometimes, the former MMFF Chairman, was able to endure for the funds of 1.6 million as "birthday Gift."
It is saddening that even the industry of making a movie is cut off and stinky, which is now widespread now.
Many say that this is not only now but the abuse or taking advantage of the country's funds are still happening but now it is slowly being monitored.
Maybe the money of the MMFF is small compared to the billions that will be filed at the Supreme Court where the lawmakers are involved but cannot be ignored.
We should also focus on it if we want to be able to watch a filipino movies every Christmas season.
