Wanted to be more effective MMDA chairman.
Jenny Reyes, July 18, 2016.
It is sad that President Rodrigo Duterte will return to Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Chairman Emerson Carlos because the people are looking for changes on the road, which is the first promise of President Duterte for his post.
How can we not be disappointed in the management of MMDA because we cannot see a comfort in the main roads in Metro Manila.
If before, even if the vehicles are starting to little by little by little, most of the vehicles are really parked in the length of EDSA that is why this problem will be solved if this is not being experienced in Metro Manila but also in all corners of the country.
So in my opinion, the local government units only does not need it if it is not for the national government's problem because we can clearly see that even in small towns there is a heavy flow of traffic.
In fact, even in progressive countries, the flow of traffic is already felt and it is an indication that the problem is very serious in need of action by the national government.
Because the national government is having a problem with traffic, there is a need to change the plan regarding the emergency powers with President Duterte, instead of being focused on Metro Manila, it should also be the implementation of the traffic problem in other towns and provinces which can be considered as a traffic problem.
Anyway, the proposed emergency powers should not be approved by the distant towns, cities and provinces like Metro Manila, the problem with traffic is still severe.
We know that through the said emergency powers, it should be better for the problem of traffic to make sure that somehow our roads and result will be productive.
