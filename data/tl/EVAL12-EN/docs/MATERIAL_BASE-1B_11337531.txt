Are you okay?

One news came out from the newspaper and placed in TV about the statement of Palawan Governor Jose Chavez Alvarez that his administration will not give a scholarship for the poor students of Western Philippines University (WPU) in Palawan.
There are a lot of agitated fishes and were surprised at the direct statement of Governor Alvarez said to the said report, the officials of WPU were shocked with the sudden decision of the university which led to the immediate action of the controversial plant due to the questionable issues released by the residents.
Governor supposedly does not hide his anger to remove his scholarship program because WPU is against his scholarship, the same company that released a mountain in the province of Zambales because of the operation of mining in the said DMCI.
Governor Alvarez supports the damage of DMCI in Palawan and as powerful governor, he ordered a scholarship for the poor students of a university who dared to express their opinion and opinions that their leader wants to happen.
Governor Luis personally owned the money he offered to his poor countrymen so he can take back if he is not in favor of what he wants in his jurisdiction?
But if he is his money in personal life, why is it that in what he did, Alvarez is not encouraging the youth of Palawan, even all the people there to use their freedom from a democratic community which is free to express their opinions.
Speech was removed when our Saligang Batas said that because Governor's rich DMCI will support his poor people who dared to object to him?
What if the governor looks like this in the whole country, what is the call of this kind of attitude?
