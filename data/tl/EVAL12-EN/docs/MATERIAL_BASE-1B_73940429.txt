There is a change in ARMM because of Robredo.

If there is a big change in AOIL Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) in the present, Gov. Faustino Dy Sr. Hataman) is full with what was due to the big contribution of the former DILG Secretary Jesse Robredo.
Camping himself is proud that the secretary is part of their implemented reform in the region.
That is why in the disappearance of the secretary, the entire Muslim community in Mindanao is also grieving.
Because the late secretary is active in supporting the reform agenda of President Aquino to ARhea, particularly the problems in politics and leadership in the region.
It can also not forget Robredo for a long time because he is always visiting Mindanao, which is why it is proven that ARMM came from him.
Aside from his smart idea, the secretary is so irresponsible because of any time he can call to talk to him.
And because of the good pork barrel that was left by the secretary to ARhea, we wish that it is just like Robredo or more who will be angry at his position.
Because the change started, perhaps this should continue.
So to you, Secretary Robredo, thank you and until we meet again.
Hopefully you will guide the one who will replace your position.
