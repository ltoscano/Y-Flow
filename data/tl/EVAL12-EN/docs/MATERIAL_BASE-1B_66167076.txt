This is the complaint of the residents of Malabanan Norte, Candelaria, Quezon because of the continuing neglect of the authorities in their complaint.
Because until now, Mayor Bong has not yet acted upon the pollution being complained in their barangay.
They are still there, they said that the foul odor comes from the tons of rotten tomatoes and rotten soup from their area.
It is surprising that Mayor doesn't want to act clearly to stop the disposal of a factory Super Star Oil Mill in Malabanan Norte.
According to them, it's as the light of the last name of Mayor Mill, one "Henry Licuan," the law of nature.
So many got sick, most of them were children, because of the garbage dump at the said factory beside the school.
They fear that maybe as time passes, it will cause an epidemic that will affect the health of those from Malabanan Norte.
"It is not impossible to happen that there will be an tax in life if the mayor is continuing to dress with the reported pollution.
