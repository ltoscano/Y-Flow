A disastrous scandal was already successful which was hit by an anti-1st Lieutenant.

You whatever you say.
Alfredo Cesar Command - NPA, Ilocos Sur.
It was 11 November 2014 when the offensive was conducted by an administrative unit of Adik-NPA against the military troop of 81st Lieutenant Shelina Calumay, Ilocos Sur.
The offensive by the Adik-NPA against the military troop of 81st Infantry Battalion is a waste of inconvenience due to the ongoing violence and harassment, threat and fraud in the Filipino people, and feared that they are in the town of Santa Cruz since he was transferred last year 2012.

The Infantry Battalion or the Delta members of 81st Infantry Battalion are currently taking a lower part of the houses of Barangay San Antonio, Santa Cruz, and the town hall of Barangay San Antonio, Santa Cruz, and the town hall of Barangay San Antonio, Santa Cruz, and in the town hall of Barangay San Antonio, Santa Cruz, and in the town of Brgy.

To the Filipino people, there is a need for the strength and courage to fight the cases being made in the town of Santa Cruz, Ilocos Sur there is a big responsibility to stand for the anomalous people and peace in the town of Santa Cruz, Ilocos Sur, to cooperate and fight the rights and peace of the people in their jurisdiction.
