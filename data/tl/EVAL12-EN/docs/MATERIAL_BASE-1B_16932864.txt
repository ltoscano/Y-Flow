"It means that (going to Kerry to the Philippines), the issue of the West Philippine Sea or South China Sea is very important to the declaration of the United States that is why it is important to the Sandiganbayan to follow the vice CA ruling and stop the military construction in WPS.
"It was also a part of the international community in China to be delivered to the PCA ruling)," said Alejano, which is why the Philippines should have been abused by the Philippines to get the help of the entire international community.
