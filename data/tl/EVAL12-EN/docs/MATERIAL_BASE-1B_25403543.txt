Witnesses: Don't it be?
By Jimmy Cantos or on September 19, 2016 were convinced that majority of those who are making decisions that La Salle College will not lose in the uites today on the 25th anniversary of the league.
Which if there is a team that can be given a good fight in La Union, this is no other than the National University of course, Ateneo won.
Everyone knows that when La Salle and Ateneo won, there are many things that can happen again and because Ateneo won, I do not know anything else but the fight of the University of the East and the University of the Philippines.

I remember last season where the officials of UP said that they target to reach the cemented finals.
I remember before that UP arrived two consecutive wins and was why I was not wondering when there was a discussion about a score of Suntok sa Garden Arena.
UP did not have the said target of this year but I have read a interview about one athlete of the team who said that he cannot understand why the game was not starting because the game was already in the mind of his colleagues.
Three losses have been experienced by UP, including the 77-83 wins in UST last Saturday and I will not be surprised if what happens to Roque.
For UP coach Bo Persist, the fight is not yet done yet but he is still convinced that UP will win a win but hopefully it will not be defeated.
Persist was happy for the game showed by his team against UST.
"" That's not "that" our best game, but we are still there, we are able to catch up, we are able to catch up, "the attitude of my biased."

Persist further added that his team is still being observed.
I am not able to talk to Roque coach Derrick Monasterio into but I know that they are already preparing for their "Champ" against UP before they meet two times when two teams will present two times.
What will happen if UP won in two fights?
Were Bonfire a fire?
