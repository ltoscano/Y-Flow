Mr. Scorpio (INTECAYETANO!

It is time for the rainy season and once we experience flooding, especially in Metro Manila, we think it is so delicious if we stay in the house to rest, together with the family.
But is this possible if we do not have saving so we are not prepared for this?
In Hong Kong, I met the Filipinization of their filipino countrymen who opened the door to our fellow OFWs there to save for their future.
According to shot, the said program started when Victor noticed that there were some of our countrymen in Hong Kong, that even after several years, they still remain to save for their family in the Philippines.
"The domestic helper, who is really no savings, goes home to the Philippines with no money, you berates him back here, so it's difficult," they said.
He also recounted to how to help those who are involved in the OFWs there for five years, which is why they need to save 200 dollars only for five years so that they need to save 200 dollars, so they need to get 200 dollars, so that they can get the interest to take advantage of it, "he explained.
They also admits that the start of this will not be that easy, because many of our countrymen have closed their minds that they should put up to the Filipinos there and they are slowly recognized and supported by them.
Many of our countrymen have helped and have been given a chance to have their own business, "the primary goal of our own business, and when they have a business to help them, and the same time, there is a business that will be sent back to the Philippines," he added.
It is a saying of the elderly: "If you're grossed out, there is still a chance to feed him, because there is time and opportunity for us to save, because we do not know what will happen tomorrow, it is better if we are ready for this.
