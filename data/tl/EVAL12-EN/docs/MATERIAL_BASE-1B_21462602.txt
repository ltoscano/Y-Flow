Hopefully, Recto stood up.

Senator Ralph Recto is going to resign from the Chairman of Committee on Wtch after receiving allegation and the proposal to lower the tax that will be filed by Palapal for cigarettes and alcohol in the country.
In the version of Recto, it was put up at the 15-20 billion pesos that should be held up for 15 billion pesos which should be held up by the government in case the "tanim-peso bill which is being attacked in the Senate will be passed.
According to some accusations, it did not become equal to the proposal shown by Recto to the Senate because of the said plant based in the place which was based in the place which was based in the place which was based in the place which is based in the treatment of "Ang" tax bill.
The additional tax that the government will earn for the proposed law should be added by the government in different programs and projects which can help our countrymen who need it.
This is a good way that if the additional tax will be passed, it is possible to stop using alcohol and cigarettes in using it to save for the resignation of Recto, what happened in the country or there is progress in the proposal which has happened in the proposal, "
If he really wants to prove that there is no corruption that caused him to lower the tax on the international tax bill, he should explain well the process and consideration of what he did and for the sake of that kind of proposal.
He couldn't answer all the accusations and concern for the resignation of Recto, hopefully it is not too late for him to clarify the speculation regarding his proposal in the "sin which needs to pass so that he would finally remove the committee he will leave.
In the "Atong" tax bill, the goal of the government is clean that the possibility to earn is clean so that the public can help to help the public who needs service and pro.
Wherein the proposed law will lead, hopefully the interest of the public will still be included in the sake of the public to make this final law.
