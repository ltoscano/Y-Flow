I am handsome now.

Because of the return of confidence and forgiveness of Hong Kong government in the government of the Philippines, the name of the former President and now Manila Mayor Erap Estrada is being swept up again.
Erap continues to implicate other presidentiable in 2016 because there are so many officials of the government, but only the former president of the country is working hard to lose the sanctions on HK government.
Erap is the only one who made a way to convince the Hong Kong to remove the unusual punishment and treatment in the Philippines because of the bloody crisis in 2010 which killed 8-K national.
Even the compensation brought to HK to 20 million is Erap will make a way for the sake of the government's funds to be lessened.
In a short word, now Erap and this should be guarded by VP Jojo Binay and Mar Roxas because there is a unique piece of points for the former President especially so many OFWs are in HK this is working hard for the betterment of their families.
Tourism in the country will surely rise again because of the success of Estrada because the HK government is also taking the ban for their National Police to go to the Philippines.
"That is what's being done now to other presidentiable because we saw the result of 2010 election which is where Erap has two children with PNoy.
If Erap was assigned by Iglesia ni Cristo last 2010, the story of politics in the country is certain because the former President in Malacanang has returned again.
A severe tactic is needed by Binay and Roxas to shoot Erap and that is what they should think and prepare for because the mother of San Juan is now the mayor of Manila.
