Visitors.

Visitors (LE. 1: 39-56) you have visitors?

When someone visits us, we are sure that we are busy in preparation.

He / she will prepare the house so it will be irritated and now that there is no delicious food.

There is still no one who is trying to get money from the guest who would like to be able to leave when we visit her cousin, who is pregnant, and sometimes we visit her cousin Elizabeth, who is pregnant, and not just once we visit her cousin, she is pregnant, but it's not just like when she visited her cousin, she is pregnant, and it is not like when she visited them.

It is hard to bring a person especially when she was in the first place, no hospital and the doctors who can be able to serve him until he stayed there, and he was the one who wanted to serve her and she was the one who wanted to serve her and she was the one who chose to serve her and she was the one who pushed him / her to serve her.

That is why it is not surprising that Jesus will follow the footsteps of Maria which is thinking about what is good to others.

NB, do not allow you to ask for your life for a long time so that you will take initiative to give... that happens: 00.
