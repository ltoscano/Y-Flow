Blind.

Blind (Less. 18: 35-43) it is difficult to be blind.

If you are blind about the goodness of others, you can't do anything even if there are simple things that you will expect that someone will attend you.

You will find it hard to get a job if you do not want attention to you.

It is hard to be blind, especially during the time of Jesus, they believe that if a person is blind or there is something wrong with his parents, that is why he has a disability, which is why he had a disability.

But it is not just his vision, Jesus comes back to the community.
