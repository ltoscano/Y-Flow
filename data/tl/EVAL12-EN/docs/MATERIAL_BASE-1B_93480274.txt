Too much.

The wife of a candidate for the barangay captain in Malabon was shot in the head and was killed last day.
According to the candidate, they have received death penalty since it was known that he will run in the coming election for the position received by Barangay Captain.
The severity of this is even the most low position that can be used to serve the country if there are killings that are really serious now.
Why?
It's because it's also not a joke, the barangay has its own budget and is powerful which is why the officials cannot give their positions in the barangay for a person who wants to serve the country or they just want to be holding power.
So I repeat, we need to stay near and take care of politicians to vote, but to a professional people.
This has been known for a long time by the members of Barangay Roxas in Quezon City that is why in this barangay, the fight is serious because there is a serious fight for running for running.
Even the young candidates are not hungry and are ready to run in politics like Atty. Niño Casimiro, youngest captain, which is possible that he chose to serve their barangay councilor even though he chose to serve as their barangay councilor.
Roxas is always news when there is a typhoon because the streets are often flooded here near the river where the leaders of the barangay are like Atty. Niño Casimiro and we hope that the corruption in the level of barangay will be forgotten.
We hope that there is a hope of good governance, only in the barangay level, so, to those who are to our barangays, there are those who supported us who are similar to Atty. Niño Casimiro.
The barangay is important and what we should put are people who will trust, good and has conviction.
