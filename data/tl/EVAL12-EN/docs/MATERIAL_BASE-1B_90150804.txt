SSS Bacoor.

A mission action, hope that it will discuss about the chief of LTO Navotas and it is very strong that he will say that his office will not be buried in a safe place because it is possible that the place will be transferred to the coast of North Manila Bay.
With what he has seen and view, it is possible that the public funds will be taken to their places which are registered to be affected and really stinky, and it is really stinky and really stinky, and because it is possible to be transferred to a safe place.
Most of all, can call attention, mission now, after someone is OJT, Aida, Aida and Fe, that is why I am looking for you to investigate and when it was known by LTO NCR Director Guadiz.
Weak.
Mr. Boaels of Navotas.
Isn't it?
It is sad that what happened to a member of the SSS is sad to ask for help from the mission of SSS every year because he has not yet been able to submit any benefits from his wife, he is still not able to submit his document because he himself will file charges.
That's why his mission was preferred to be brought to the Catholic Church for the process that was immediately given to Bacoor City, and he was able to talk to his employer that's why she was told that her employer has not yet returned to investigate the reason why she was already dead.
After a few weeks, he went back and looked for the newly-known acquaintance in the said branch but he was not able to go back and gave an advice on how they will go back to each other, and he will just go back to each other again, and he will just wait for help to what he will do.
