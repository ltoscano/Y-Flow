If you can't lead Mr. Benigno Simeon Aquino III (Bira 3), it is better for you to resign before you resign.
On Monday when you talk on television, as if you do not have an initial appeal to the television network, you said, you are successful with the strength of typhoon Yolanda, you have a good warning to our countrymen in the affected provinces and towns.
It is true that you are warned but the people understand the "storm surge," the "typhoon" or the super typhoon? "Do you know that many are dead if not included in the assigned evacuation centers?
You also spoke as if you report it as if you said, thousands of relief goods every second day, where are those who are giving help from the helicopter, which is the one who will give assistance from the helicopter that is brought about by ten sacks?!
In your interview with CNN News by the program Asibars, you said again that it was irritated, and you were removed from the main roads; not only the Filipinos are watching and they know that there is no sensible way to save and help the victims of Yolanda.
The words uttered by CNN host is painful if you understand him that what you are doing is clear, you are not ashamed of what you say in your SONA, "where do you get off the shortcomings of your personnel and continue to cover up the shortcomings of your personnel."
Now, the different kinds of reactions from our countrymen in many social media will surface or you have read everything or not to show to you your obsequious and lazy personnel?
One of the call that is focused on Facebook and other social media, "it seems that the people who are the only ones who are the ones who are the only ones from the Malacañang and the members of the Malacañang and are the ones who are the only ones to stop it!
