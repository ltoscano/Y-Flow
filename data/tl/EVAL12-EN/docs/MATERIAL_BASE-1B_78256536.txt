BOC, the Bureau of Top Rank Promotions?

We sympathize with some friends who are Customs brows last Sunday.
But in our last meeting, I think they were thrown at each other for four years, "the former energy of the face and crispy mudfish, and they were even asked, it was light and small because it was the trend in the Bureau of Customs (BOC) even before it comes to her.
They say, Commissioner John Sevilla, who is a child of Finance Chief Cesar Purisima, well, is really good that it means to go straight and have no corruption in BOC?
The broker made a grin in my question, here is the story.
In the very clean (clean) of Ariel Sevilla, the previous week that it reached two to three months, it's always right, the right thing, "commissioners of all of his personnel did not make sure of all the process that resulted in all the jobs of Cusipag.
As a matter of fact, all the BOC District Cologne, now seems to be coercion and in the initiative to realize the whole agency is just because of the wrong suspicion of his boss John.
District they did not need to process and if they do it, it depends on the position.
Businessmen who have a transaction with BOC have also wanted to go wild because of the slow process just because of the right process, "Sevilla said.
Just like someone who arrived at a ship going to a ship but was not allowed to anchor in the dock because of the right suspicion that only one month has been waited for almost a month.
Is your policies, John, what if only a small businessman is involved?
We are dead!
That is why the economy is beneficial than being lively, you know, the Small Town Lottery, whose medium built, is tired, and you think that it is tired and expenses that they will eat.
The style is, how much is the BOC be annoyed, maybe the Bureau of Mobiline, Mister John?
The quarrel between the two of your two people is not a secret and you have not seen him in front of your office!
