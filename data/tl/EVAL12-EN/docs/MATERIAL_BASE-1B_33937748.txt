Annabelle Rama believes that they are being monitored and guided by the Sto. Nino and Venice because Ruffa Gutierrez's two young lady, who saw their mother every time she is losing consciousness.
Ruffa's health condition was the reason why Annabelle screamed at the press conference at the press conference of this season of IT Tawz.
I remember that Annabelle was worried that, according to her, she died for five minutes and brought to the hospital of the ambulance who was called by Richard Gutierrez, because of what happened, she called her eldest child in the house of her eldest child who called him in the telephone when she had an emergency.
Ruffa became aware of the doctors, he has already undergone MRI (magnetic resonance imaging (WBC), but Annabelle was still not able to determine the root of his empty ammunition so Annabelle plans to bring him to a hospital in Singapore.
Annabelle has a doubt that it is too much stress is the reason why Ruffa became out of his own business which has no connection with the business which has no connection in showbiz.
