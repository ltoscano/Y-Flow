It is good to live.

There will be no one who will be able to sleep with yourself but you are the only one, they depend on others to avoid him.

True wealth, health is the health of all things that will be the next for this: Dreams, relationships, jobs, etcetera, and you will voluntarily stop, and without any amount.

Balos, not all; and even if it is on its bottom, you will not be brought to each other for every moment is focused on your safety.

Our body, even if we want to make it or not, it is not being treated as time passes by, it is not being treated if there is a disease, just like plants, just like plants.

This is being treated in every day; she is taking care of it, and we should be careful with the importation of things, instead, the foolishness of their nature, fresh and nutritious food.

Not everyone will be busy at work or all of them will only have money.

It seems like he is prison bars, his mind is imprisoned, and blind to the events in the world, but, in his last day, he said that it would never happen to his office or work, and even in his last day, he said that it would never happen again because the time is changing and no certainty.

There is a need to follow and sufficient discipline if you want to live healthy and peaceful, instead in the hospital and currently in a grave illness, there is a severe pain that continues to be built in your body, in their future expenses.

The bravery of a person is not how much the wealth she has received, but from his integrity and ability to make her feel positive with his loved ones.

It's just a simple rules and they can easily finish their studies.

Love your Buhay, make goodness, and live comfortably.

Only this and nothing else.

Are you directly doing these now?
