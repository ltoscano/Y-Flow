A justifiable Filipino masses is launched by the Liberal Party of the Philippines-Bagong Hala Bayan.

With their failure, the AFP is giving up lies and black propaganda to lower their statements that happened between the revolutionary movement and fight of the people with the objection and fight of the people with the worsening poverty and fight for the future of the National Police.

In order to discredit the armed people, the AFP and they are expecting that the AFP who have no fight against the American soldiers and those who were confiscated by the American soldiers and those who were confiscated from their responsibilities in front of the masses, and those who were confiscated from their responsibility and they are trying to scare their responsibilities in front of the people.

It is the Pukan in the revolutionary fight of the society who chose to remove it in order to change the rotten system of the country, the Botchok (HB), of big corporation, mining and other foreign interests.

The government of the government cannot accept the bitter fate of the soldiers who were wounded and died in the fight between the people of the Philippines (GPhilippine) and the AFP who were used to fight against the people, which is why the government needs to fight and use the orders of the citizens to support the people, which is why it needs to be approved and used in defending the citizens.

This serves as an inspiration for the people for the simultaneous offensive launched by Bagong Hunan Bayan.

While the AFP is getting tired of the attack of the southern part of the southern part of Quezon, Rizal and Batangas, the history of the AFP and the entire country continues to understand and get stronger on the history of the opposition of the AFP, which is why the history of the fighting between the AFP and the entire country continues to understand and get stronger against the foolishness and taking advantage.

The success of the citizens of Isabela is one of the success of the Filipino people for justice and their democratic rights.

Long live the Bagong Hala Bayan!
It will continue to push for the Pambansang Kamao in Bago-Mas higher level!
