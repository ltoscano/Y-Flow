RTEL. 4, 1-13) has a story in a story with a Manang who is very rich and very intelligent that sometimes she goes in Europe.

He said: "I'm sure that there are many envious of me because I have been going to go to another person and she said that she was deceived when she was deceived by her friends, she said that she was deceived when she was deceived by her friends, and she said that she was deceived when she was deceived by her friends."

Many of us have been victims of illegal drug addicts, who have promised to have a promise with good jobs in other countries but I am sure that there will be a lot of beautiful words and promises of the candidates that when they are in the position, it would be a lot of people who have been victimized by the politicians and the Budol-budol gang.

First, he challenged the bread for stones that can be done by Jesus.

The power of Jesus is to bring the person to God.

Second, he is tempted to give all the kingdom of land if he will cover the demon in the world, but for the good of all people and not for the Lord, Jesus will be admired by God and will be admired by the people if he does this.

But Jesus will never be able to ask God to challenge the Lord who has made up wealth, power, fame and God will not be deceived and he is the only one who will serve the Lord God, "wealth, power, fame."

To those who are against us, let us imitate Jesus. We read the holy document so we should not let us be deceived.
