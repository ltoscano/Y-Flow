What are the pitiful ones to look down?
If you are looking for a job you are busy with, you are still not in the house.
I am here in what you are at home now, even if you are in a house, we are already hungry; I am already hungry; we are still hungry; we are still hungry; we are still young.
Pinugay, lo City.
