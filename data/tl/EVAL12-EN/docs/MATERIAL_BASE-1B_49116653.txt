PNoy was asked by the SC, Tina Mendoza June 8, 2016.
Before he got out of his position, the Supreme Court wants President Noynoy Aquino to give his explanation on the questionable appointment of the two Sandiganbayan Justices.
President Aquino was given the SC for 10 days to file comment on the petition of National Bureau of the Philippines (IBP) where it was stated that Malaca√±ang has violated the Constitution when it will be placed under Associate Justice Geraldine Fault and Michael Macasaels in the anti-graft court.
According to the IBP, President Aquino violated Section 9, Article VII of the Constitution so he will not be placed in a vacant position in the Sandiganbayan which is against the 20th-list submitted by the Judicial and Bar Council (JBC) that it is against the ranks of nominees for the 16th government to choose the President.
It is stated in Article VIII in the Constitution that the members of the judiciary should be the care of the President from the list of Judicial and Bar Council that are prepared for each other.
