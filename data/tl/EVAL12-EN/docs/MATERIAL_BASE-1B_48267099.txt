The Liberal Party of the Philippines (PKP) convinced the Filipino people to dismiss the offer of "Pogi" which was allegedly done yesterday by the new US Secretary of State named John Kerry who was said to have helped in the rehabilitation of Foreign Affairs Secretary Alberto del Rosario.
"The Filipino people should dismiss this kind of offer to escape because it was made to escape from the local and international law which aims to escape from the local and international law which aims to enter the boat of the US so that they could not get on board the boat.

"The offer of the US and his escape from the violation of its violation to the laws of the Philippines is an insult to the Filipino people," said the military members from the Philippines so that they will not give up to the authorities in the Philippines.

"No matter what kind of damage to the flood, it can be proven that it will be someone who swallowed our national dignity and hope that it depends on our national dignity and if it depends on our minds, sovereignty," said the KP.

"Marcos regime should not allow his cheating to allow the government of the US to allow the law of the Philippines and for its not to file a case against the military of the Philippines," said PKP, "said the pension increase of the US and the pension increase of the US and the pension increase."
