Payment from Irrigation Project until December 31.

August 19, 2016.

City of Calamba, Laguna, August 19 (Pia) - it was clarified by the management of the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) on the payment of Irrigation Project (ISS) by the farmers in the whole country, until December 31 of the present year.

Although President Rodrigo Roa Duterte has a statement to take the payment for ISF, this will start on January 1, 2017, which is why farmers are trying to continue paying taxes until this year.

In a radio interview, Agriculture Secretary Manny Pi√±ol appealed to the farmers, "I am calling on our farmers that this year, we should finish the payment for ISF because if you do not pay this year, there will be a problem in NIA."

Sec. Pinol explained that the amount given by "No ConF," free irrigation is still in 2017, if the farmers will not have a problem because this is where the salary of employees and officials of NIA will come from.

"I hope you can't understand what we can understand.

Secretary Petilla stressed that if President Duterte promised, this will be fulfilled but it is just needed to pass through the right process and not to shock NIA because it will have a problem.

According to Secretary Petilla, it is being done by a different working group, what is the law that should be changed, what should be given to NIA to support the promise of President Duterte for free irrigation.

"I will repeat, this will be fulfilled of Number 2 because that is the promise of President Duterte, but we should wait for the law, the mandate of NIA because if you do not pay for it, it will have difficulty in operating for NIA," the end of the Secretary.

For the meantime, for the farmers in the province of Laguna, if you have questions, you can call Marias M. Dela Cruz, public utility officer of NIA Region IV-A-55407twenty-0-528064846728064846728060s), Pia A, Pia A.
