Correct, President Digong is important.

For the last corporals, the grades of President Aquino fell down because his popularity also fell.
The worst is, there are only few who trust his ability as President of the country.
He whispered to our economy to progress but this is not what the people feel.
According to the price of rice, the price of gasoline is still high because the price of gasoline is still high, supply of electricity and no proper public service is not enough, because the price of ordinary employees are not enough.
In other words, many are still hungry, many are still unemployed and many of the leaders of our country are going to borrow from the public funds.
The funds for the improvement of the lives of the poor (pork barrel and DAP) are being used by politicians for their own interest.
Their money is too much to support their families but they continue to raise the theft.
They prioritize the huge funds of poverty instead of the salary of the employees.
It was right that Caloocan Representative Edgar Erice was pointed to have left the 6-year-old president and this is long for the bad and corrupt President.
That's why it's only right that President Aquino will not last in the care of President Aquino "because PNoy is bad and not a good president.
What Erice thought is wrong that PNoy is the ones who saved the poverty of poverty in the country, the truth is, poverty can also worsen.
If you really want to help and fix the country, you will get out of your work and show to the people that you are serving for your interest.
I am always supporting the new President, we believe that he should be given a chance to give goodness and make it good for the country.
That is why in his remaining year and months in position, we are hoping that there will be a miracle happening in his service, and we are firm that it is not right through charter change but for me, what is being favored by our President is right, and not Sinsero who is right.
