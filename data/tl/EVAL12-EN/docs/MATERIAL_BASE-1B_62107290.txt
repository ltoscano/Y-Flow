"It is martial law in Taguig.

Because of a Temporary Protection Order which was released by the Supreme Court, the complicated "anti-cybercrime law should not be implemented yet."
But in a different class, the event in Taguig City is a different kind.
Because of the reality in the Taguig-Pateros District Hospital, someone posted on Facebook "about his failure.
And because they know the truth, there are 16 nurses who expressed their "epal."
"It's just that, make sure, and that is the reason.
Do you see if this is not worse than "martial law, so that the poor nurses suddenly lost their jobs!
And then he will let the people do anything else and it is obvious that Mayor Laarni Cayetano and it is obvious that the only reason for the abuse of the poor nurses.
"There, those from Taguig, your mayor's attitude!
What is admirable is, for those who have not yet known, Mayor Laarni Cayetano is the former "staff of his wife, Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, who also voted there, which is why the anti-cybercrime law has passed."
