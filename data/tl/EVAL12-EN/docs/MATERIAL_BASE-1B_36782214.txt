It is a big change in Andy Sevilla, September 26, 2016.
There is a possibility that the government's management will be returned to the Department of Agriculture because this is not given attention by the Office of the President.
This is the statement of Department of Finance Secretary Carlos Domogan, the members of the Islamic Liberation Front last week.
In our interrogation, Sec. Esperon also said that even before it was in the Department of Agriculture in the Department of Agriculture in the Department of the Agriculture in the department of the industry, many sectors of the industry of race was released from the Office of the country, which is why the sales and Revenue, which is being taken by the government, will be looked at.
It has been years since the race was hit by the sales of P8-billion pesos in the year 2004, but it did not succeed after more than 10 years and what was worse was that it went to the P7-billion worth of sales last year and are looking like it has also been an increase that is registered after the present year.
Are the resolved by the people placed in Malaca√±ang on the problem of the industry about the entry of many gambling and Gaming Corporation in the country such as casino, online Gaming, jueteng, that there are many others who are not able to answer.
So, how will this rise from the low industry of race in the country, if that is the case it is not yet given a solution to the problems he is facing?
It might be a solution to what Sec. Domogan, if it can be returned to the Department of Agriculture in this industry, a big change will happen here!
