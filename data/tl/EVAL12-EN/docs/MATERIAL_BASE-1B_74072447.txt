From my brother's to you, it was around four o'clock in the morning when his remains arrived at the Heritage Village at the armpit.
Where are you here who are members of the family and relatives because earlier we were able to talk to Ronie Quezon and Roel Dizon, their heartfelt gratitude is no one left and continued prayers so we should listen to what they said.
According to course.
We will go too much and you will really be happy to support everything that will bring you today.
Our year-year-old man became good but I heard it not to hear.
Everybody is complete.
You are handsome and deaf.
They are on and pick up.
There was a driver who still gave birth to my father, like General Santos.
She was still in grade.
For us to go to our town, who did not go to the Publishing back in the Agency (Agency).
They would like to meet their social interaction but they can see that you are also a little bit here at the Heritage Village, which will be opened this morning until three o'clock in the afternoon.
