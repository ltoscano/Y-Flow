Will the sacrifice in LTFRB be finished?
By between Dacer July 22, 2016) you should be annoyed if you have a transaction in the agency Land Transportation Office (LTFRB) that we wish to change under the Duterte administration.
In the past government, the agency's system is slow and complicated.
That's why we aspire to think and this is a new official in the character of LTFRB chairman Martin Delan, a lot of cases in this agency who are really distressed as the paper.
Many applicants have a franchise in the taxi and other kinds of public vehicles in LTFRB who almost lose hope of the process of the documents.
In my opinion, maybe it is not right for two years to wait for two years for the process given by the LTFRB like some of the officials who made the LTFRB for some of his request to extend the contribution of the person he is driving in.
I was not able to mention his name maybe he was hit by a taxi that there was a franchise and he changed a new unit and asked for a franchise and to transfer the said franchise of the new vehicle.
He was able to reveal all sorts and times to be followed up until the LTFRB asked to be followed up until he had told the said application for him to be returned to the legal and going to be returned to a board until he was returned for a board.
In other words, these words from the LTFRB are just repeating until the current month and year, they still do not have adequate attention only for two years to support his family.
This is only one of the many institutions that they are going through, and hopefully, under the government of Duterte, he will be able to lose it because of the political will that the chosen to lead the said office led by DOTC Sec. Arthur Tugade where the LTFRB is under.
