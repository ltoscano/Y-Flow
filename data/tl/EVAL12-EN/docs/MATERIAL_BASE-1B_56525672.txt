One angel.

One member of the Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC) is what I am confused recently.
You said, for him and for all the members of his family and the whole clan, Felix Manalo, the chief of church of INC, is an angel.
For most of us, the image of the angel came from its wing the character and not walking on earth.
But there are those who experience the image of an angel when the angel is a symbol of safety, peace, and road towards the door of the sky.
The angel was recognized, cleanliness and pity.
An angel is hope, faith and humility.
The ordinary creature is getting along well with an angel to get an insult to the Lord.
The angel, we believe that everyone is a followers of the Lord who can milk them to gather all the roads going to heaven.
According to the person I was talking to of the INC, they are fortunate that we are lucky and we are lucky because we, Filipinos, and a Filipina are one of the countries in Asia that have a strong belief and life to continue to live Jesus in our community.
There are people who have been reported to us like Felix Manalo, who had a point and on this point, he did not focus on all of the detration that is being followed by the INC.
The passing of this mother is the revelation of the continuing unity of the INC, to their continuing being an institution with the country to keep peace and order and meaning of the community.
That is why Felix Manalo is the one I spoke with is an angel from Asia.
On the 25th of July, INC is going to celebrate the continuation of their being strong and because of the strong belief of the person I was talking to, every time I see the tarpaulins that I see the image of Felix Manalo, an angel, in my mind.
