Hahaha!: Bargain.
Byan Perez, September 11, 2016, it will be known in November 5, if Senator Manny Pacquiao is still very proud of the boxing fans on his fight with WBO welterweight champion Jesse Vargas.
This is where it will be known if the fight between the senator against Vargas will be removed from the box office and PV V, which is part of many boxing fans on different parts of the world.
A lot of fans are supposed to take care of Pacquiao and not Vargas to face each other so that he can be able to go down and is not able to sleep with his decision to turn the fight of WBO super-governmental weight champion with his decision to put the fight of WBO super-governmental weight champion with Jessie Maganto.
Meanwhile, Arum ensured that it can be seen in Pacquiao's fight for the very amount of $50 which is almost worth $50, $300, $300, $300, $500 and most expensive to be the $700.
The $50 would be too bargain when Pacquiao's fight against Floyd Mayweather Junior, which the youngest ticket was $1,500 and the most expensive is $30,000 pesos.
Arum might have been burnt by the burial fight of the senator to Tim Bradley last April that was only PhpPV.
Aside from the threat of Vargas in the boxing fans, it might have no effect with the one-time promotion that the senator did at Beverly Hills Hotel, the day before yesterday.
This is contrary to his previous fight with a press tour in three big cities such as New York, Las Vegas and San Francisco.
