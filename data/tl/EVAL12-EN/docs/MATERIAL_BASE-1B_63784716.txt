Something happens with PhilHealth, SSS.

It seems that, he doesn't want to get free, rather, there will be more than many agencies and government officials and government officials.
The billion pork barrel and DAP were not yet finished, there is again one million bonus of the SSS official.
Just a few more days have passed, it was exposed that about 1.4 billion pesos, which was accepted by the officials of PhilHealth.
But at the back of this scandal, the Palace even defended the billions of billion pesos to the said officials.
According to them, they have to earn money, which is why the officials who run it should have received a bonus.
Right, but if millions will be thrown in the pocket of the said officials, is it not good for the members and an instructor.
One member, the debt of debt is just low in spite of the huge fund that the officials of SSS have been presented.
Just like the SSS member, the ftor of PhilHealth can only get a small help if they get sick.
It is just right that the officials of the two Gore C have a bonus to have a bonus, but do not be too much because there is something foolish there.
