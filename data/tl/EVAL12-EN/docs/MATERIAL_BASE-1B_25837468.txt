Are you sleeping?

Good memory should be used to forget the senseless rumors.

Many are sleeping in the whole afternoon even though they are awake in tasks or things, whatever they do, those things that need to be given appropriate attention should not be forgotten and nothing is related to the progress of mind, relationships, and finances.

We should consider two things that we should consider as your goal and spiritual events in this world, what's more important is to call the contents of the contents of this world, if all of them have forgotten, where you are going to, where you are going to, and what you want.

There are language; "the things that can't be seen is the primary important thing," similar to Pag-mindedness, body, and soul that we use and the real personality that we take for every day.

We are not sure what will happen in each moment, but what we need to know is it's good to see things that are not related to your life's life, and what's important is that you have nothing to do with the life of those who do not have anything to do with other things.

If you have love for yourself, do not consider the opinion of others about you because there is a different direction where you are going.

Stand for your real intentions, most of all, whatever happens to your fares, even if you are the only one who has the responsibility and will receive any result, you will be the only winner or lose.

Make sure to ask for permission, admiration, and praise of other people, "what's right is that you should focus on your own cooking oil anymore, and when you feel that you are important to see you, you should have forgotten to see you, in case you forget to see you, in case you seem to be able to forget to you.

If you understand your real personality, you will immediately forget your real personality, you will take the initiative to forget the cad of you, and you are just a show of your real mission in this world: A real Filipino.
