Now, more.

I have heard a lot of people saying that they do not have any Christmas this year because there are still many who have been victimized by the calamity, and now there are still some who say that they do not have any Christmas, but what kind of Christmas is, the day is still looking for each other, the day in commemoration of the birth of Jesus.
If there is no money, we will not be ready, there is no Christmas season, that is why there is no Christmas season, but some of our countrymen lost all the houses, things, that's why some of our countrymen lost all their houses, things, that's why some of our fellowmen lost their homes, that is why some of our fellowmen lost their homes and will not forget about this day.
Upon arriving at the Philippines, it is already Christmas in the Philippines, until the month ends, the arrival of the child Jesus will come out in spite of a new opportunity and a new start, Christmas is a celebration and thanks because of the given by MG ah.
So what we need now is Christmas, now that many of us will lose their hearts and their heart will be ruined and there is a proof that we need the Lord to face each other and we should not lose hope.
We need more Christmas today, we need to steal a small Christmas lanterns at our windows, no matter how much we are going through, it is better that we need to celebrate all the hope and the pirates that we will get, now, more than ever.
