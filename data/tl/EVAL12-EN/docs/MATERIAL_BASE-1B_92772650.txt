It's a good deed of PAGCOR, thank you!

It is against the morality of Filipino culture that the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) has been made up.
This is related to their research that the primary point is to increase the gambling dens in the whole country to increase the table and chairs in our schools.
Just like what I've went through, it can't bear the mistake in order to be right, it is proper that there is no morale that causes gambling and illegal drugs.
What I wonder about is why this kind of PAGCOR has been doing something like PAGCOR was there when Maricar Bautista is there or she is known for Ma'am Pilar's call.
Why do you think?
It means, that Ma'am Pilar is the one responsible for doing things such as PAGCOR, which in my perspective, he can be considered Mr. STS.
If I am Ma'am Pilar, I will stop these kinds of doing such a lot of commercials because aside from defending me, it is certain that this will surely block them by the Commission on Audit (COA).
Just imagine, millions of pesos are being spent by PAGCOR to make it through meaningless acts, but this should not be the priority of the agency, right, people?
What my hairs stood over was when we discovered that Ma'am Pilar has made it but it seems like she has forgotten her being a scholar of the Bayan.
For your knowledge, Ma'am Pilar is a wise person from the university of the Philippines who graduated from the course, dyed, and since then he worked with the two respected company of the media on television.
Just a question, Ma'am Pilar, what has happened to your intelligence, that is why you agree with Mr. STS.
Do you forget that a real scholar of the Bayan and decent journalists in the television since you took office from PAGCOR - the local motorcycle of gambling in the entire country, "if there's time!
