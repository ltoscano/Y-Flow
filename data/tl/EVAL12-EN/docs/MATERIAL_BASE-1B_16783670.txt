TV Patrol, November 3, 2014.

Slow Representative Proseso NID is slow in the municipal hall of Taguig.

It was just earlier that I was accompanied by my step to get documents for the search for work when we were able to ask for work for a few days since we started to take care of the papers at around 3: 00 in the morning when we arrived at the town of our barangay.

In the municipal hall, we first prioritized the Police Clearance or the trend for now, let the receipt show up, and then he will have to pay for the tuition in the City Hall, maybe because the process is not for a long time, maybe because there is only a little time that we go.

The next day we went to Postanes Office at the edge of the municipal hall because we have paid P450 pesos for the price hike which we have experienced, we went home first to take rest because we have no idea to get a NBI if there is no ID number.

Before I went back to five o'clock in the afternoon, I went back to my step at home and I told me that I could not help but even at five o'clock in the same time, I asked that it was just exactly 5: 00 in the same time, but I told me that it was just exactly 5: 00 at the same time, but I said that it was not good if that was the same time?

Because the others were almost fed up because for a long time, they still love not to avoid his thoughts from a long time, but when we suddenly lit up, an employee of the municipal hall and explained to us, that's why before, the service was quick in order to save the Postigo.

According to him, it is made by the local governments of the local Public Services Program, the mayor did not control the way of their services, but now, there was no change in paper, but instead, there was no change in paper, but instead, there was no changes in the paper, but instead, there was no changes in the paper, but instead, there was no changes in the paper, but it was not yet passable by a billion pesos.
