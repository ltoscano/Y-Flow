Danny Lim in NFA.

It looks like the news received by the retired General Danny Lim of the Bureau of Customs (BoC) will be held accountable for the former National Food Authority (NFA) Lito Lapid.
Because this is the talk of people who will be annoyed with different coffee shop in the country and other crowd because it is said that it is just a gunshot that is lacking in the seat of Lim in NFA.
Even in BOC, the transfer of Lim in NFA is still clear on the rays of the sun because it has already been released by Malacanang.
Lim said he personally appealed to the Palace to be transferred to the legislative chamber because he wants his own kingdom, according to BOC, he is only one of the personnel of the said agency.
Anyway, Lim is asking for any position that he received from us because the retired general is really good, aside from having a principle which is really based on the straight path of President Noynoy Aquino.
NFA won the moment that Lim can push through because aside from the hardworking family, the said agency will surely win out of its rotten personnel who are like rotten rice in the storage.
