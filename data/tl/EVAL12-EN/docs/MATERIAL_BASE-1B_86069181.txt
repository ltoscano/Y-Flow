State of Bangsamoro Address, welcome the SONA of PNoy.

By Magida Sali July 2, 2012.

City of Cotabato - the Filipino Moro will conduct a huge protest in the coming July 22, 2012 that will be held at 8: 00-11: 00am in Rizal Park to convey the real condition of the Filipino people.

The activity will not be in a pile of different Filipino organizations which led the 2-year anniversary of PNoy's leadership, this is not different from the past administrations that the Filipino people still continue to suffer.

Even if there is a flooding of projects in the community, it is not going to meet the economists that are of the citizens.

It can be seen in the community of Moro who are lacking in social service such as health center because its lack is severe, especially the most dangerous barangays.

Meanwhile, the giving of one million pesos to some famous politicians in the past Aspe, Region for Muslim Mindanao Command (Local Government (Local Government (Local Government) Convention Center in Davao City will be suppressed and ensure the victory of his will build a politician in the coming 2013 election.

The said money has no clear use, because it is a reward of PNoy to the chosen leader of the Filipino people for the true reform and those who are pushing for the rights in your own decision (Commission on self-Deo).

The group is calling the Filipino people to act and stand in pushing the real reform and achieve peace that is based on justice.
