After being blamed by the left behind by former president and now Pampanga Congresswoman Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, he still continues to blame Vice President Benigno Simeon Aquino III for his teacher in front of Foreign Cormorant in front of Foreign Cormorant in front of Foreign Cortabista, he also did his excessive destroying GMA in South Korea.
Over three years already, GMA still is in the brain and mouth of the question, is there really a hindrance or conclusion to his leadership in the country?, if there is, it is true that there is a disturbance in Quezon Avenue and Araneta Avenue.
Applauding the obsequiousness.
We have a pile of problems in the typhoon anger and land that are going to be buried in different kinds of calamities like the earthquake in Visayas, but it seems that the people are going to be buried in different parts of the program, that is why the people are just doing anything but those who are just taking care of the camera.
This is after extorting money from the previous administration is the negligence of our airports, especially the name of his father - the name of NAIA (WRL) in the world where you continue to neglect our door in the world, ah, it's the fault of GMA "that?

It is easy to cover the world of your quarrels or Aquino to do a projects and programs that can be seen, be sent to the meantime and our eyes and minds will remain in the end of our eyes and mind.
Do not be blamed, not all anger, you should just put the statue of your father - the door we pass in the world, the Ninoy Aquino International Criminal Court!
