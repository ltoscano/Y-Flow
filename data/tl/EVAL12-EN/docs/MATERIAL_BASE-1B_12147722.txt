There is no trace of garbage in Manila Bay.

In every part where you will look back then the one to witness the one to witness you will be the one to witness.
The garbage that was hit by the canals, the houses of the illegal settlers in every part of Manila which becomes the cause of speeding canal, due to the dirt and garbage that are done by the people who are considered.
The people continue to do not care of throwing garbage anywhere, they do not mind if the river is filled with trash, canals, canal and improvement of the garbage where the sea is coming back and scattered on the garbage.
Why is it that until now, the government is still not able to give their request? The leaders who built a shack in the inlet canals and canal in the Manila should be sent away.
They intentionally looked into it apart from causing garbage that is why the image of the Philippines is very dangerous to tourists who see people who are watching the shanties at the side of the road.
According to Manila Bay Coordinating Office (MBGHMC) Executive Director Noel Antonio V. Gellan, and the problems about those who have been poisoned?
The government already had a few programs that is about to be given a piece of land where we are going to be given a piece of land that they can use and give them a piece of land that they can use, and out of City which is the program for them that we give.
