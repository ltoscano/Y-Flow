The free College was held.

The House Bill Number 6577 or free College was approved by the Lower House of Congress in the content of the proposal to build-free schools, High School which can be allowed to go to State Universities (Colleges and local college and university.
It is also stated in this that there is no need to pay the College so the poor public high school students who are included in the leading 10 percent of their First Class.
The departure of the medical exam will give opportunity to the poor students to enter a good school where there is a financial help.
I believe that it is the HB 6577 - the suspension of the works on HB 6262 and HB 5186 which are also made by Taguig Representative Sigfred Uytengsu - it will help our progress in poverty.
