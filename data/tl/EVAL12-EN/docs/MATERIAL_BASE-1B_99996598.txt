PU Vs, isn't it?

It is probably in the end that the so-called queen of mine in the country will be buried in the end after Justice Secretary Leila de Lima recently will meet with Janet Napoles recently.
Attention, the people!
Well, you will contact it! Napoles will sing all his knowledge in the controversial pork barrel scam involving the famous personalities in the government.
It means, it is possible that Napoles can be included in the ranks of the so-called "State Witness Protection means, it is possible that Napoles will be included in the ranks of" Whisticated candidate. "
If it happened that Napoles is still a hero and absolved from any kind of plunder case, including the illegal detention case that was filed against him.
President Noynoy admits that there is no pillow! PR... that it is not like that! After you want the people to make the people fight against them, he will suddenly be in favor of Napoles.
The people are not stupid that you can persevere on your style, rotten, just to push for your personal interest in Malacanang.
There are still Filipinos who do not know how to know the masses but they are not stupid that they cannot understand what is happening in the country especially in any various activities.
It was clear what the "dog" of PNoy said was clear, the President had an important condition before he spoke with Napoles, and the direct report that changed his songs.
When Napoles is nurtured by PNoy, he is on his side with PNoy that is just like the simple point of Atty. Leila - one of the known who is called "Atsuko Dog" of PNoy.
But the first thing I got worried now is that the lower part of the lower part of PNoy is that when it is PNoy's ally, "that is if he is not included in the scene, it is also a possibility of envious people!
