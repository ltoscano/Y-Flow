Grand Slam, the Alaska is being discussed.

In!

A true competition can be considered by Alaska Milk team who is Wilfred Uytengsu.
As a proof, it is not yet done by Game six to the finals, PBA Commissioner's Cup between the Aces and Rain or Greg are already accepted by Uytengsu, their defeat.
There was one minute and a 22 seconds after he stood up from his seat at the back of the Aces and went to the place where the owner of Rain or Shine's owners are sitting and greeted him and greeted him.
That is the "First Republic" which can be considered.
The truth is, this is painful for Wilfred Uytengsu because they have been paying for three consecutive wins.
Isn't it that they have two children in San Miguel Beer in Governor's Cup last year and in the past Philippine Cup finals, they made the Beermen, 3-0 to the sake of San Miguel and won in the last four games for champion.
That is the very first time in spite of the league of the whole world that a team has returned to 0-3 and the championship was returned to 0-3 and it was granted to Alaska Milk that they have been victimized.
And as early as now, they almost laid to sweep the Rain or Greg even if they can be able to finish the X-ray.
But of course, on the same time for Alaska Milk, instead of putting up, they still have two wins and they are just short in the end.
The joke now is the possibility that Alaska Milk has not yet complete the Grand Slam, the Aces can't complete, but the Aces can do this, the Aces are in place.
Will Alaska Milk has to agree then, would I agree to really happen that it is more painful, isn't you going to forget this season where you can't forget this season, but you could not do it!
Certainly, Wiltshire and Alaska Milk coach Alex Comton is going to do everything so that the moments will not be repeated again and the end of season will not be repeated again.
