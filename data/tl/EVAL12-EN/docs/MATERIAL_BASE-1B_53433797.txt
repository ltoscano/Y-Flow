FOI seems good for the 17th Congress By Aries (June 5, 2016 with having a good hope for those who are pushing the Islamic Freedom Fighters (FOI) bill to implement the proposal under the Duterte administration.
The positive outlook in the FOI is confirmed by Misamis Occidental Cong. Jorge Almonte, Paranaque City Cong. Gus Tambunting this 17th Congress because of the alleged interest of President-elect Rodrigo Duterte to become a law to Access Road in order to be protected from the government transparency in the government.
"In my opinion in the 17th Congress, this is probably in the 17th Congress, he is interested to return to our President-elect, he is interested to become a law for the Access Road," stated by Almonte, the chairman of the House Committee on public funds that would lead to the proposal in the next Congress.
It is hoping that the process of hearing the proposal will be easy because this is a basis of the 16th Congress.
This is also the view of Tambunting who said that the debate on the proposal might be short because it has gone to the committee, because the congressman is hoping that this will not be a dream in the coming administration.
"Yes, we, but what's good here is that it has been passed by the committee... the debate will be the will of the country to be defeated," added a heated argument.
