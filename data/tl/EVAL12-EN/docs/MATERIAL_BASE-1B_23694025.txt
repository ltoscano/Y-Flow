Vice President Jejomar Binay crashed.

Postanes and his mind.
On January 14, 2015.
In Bulabugin.

It seems that the latest survey took the latest survey to Vice President Jejomar Binay.
"Is it a rock at the side of the ravine that was slowly burned but it does not stop.
In the latest survey, the Binay has two percent of 5 percent.
But his new Spokesman Attorney Rico Quicho said, "Quicho said, that it is okay because VP Binay is still a number one another.
That is true.
But we say, it seems like a rock is still a rock at the side of the ravine "that is a survey."
Aside from that, if there will be someone who will get a rock from it and threw him up on top of the top.
Anyway, on the other hand, it seems that the survey of VP Binay is like that because in the next week, you will see, give new houses (as if you have their own money.
Or the relief goods in Visayas will be distributed, even if there is no typhoon.
They will be deacing where and we can see that he is growing up in the market.
Or maybe there is another new gimmick.
Let us wait for it, maybe Binay's camp has a new style.
Bow!
