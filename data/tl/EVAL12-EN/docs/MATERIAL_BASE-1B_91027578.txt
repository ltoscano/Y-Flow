New year, new hope.

I will lead to you to the Manunuri ng New Year to maintain our fingers complete when it comes to 2014.
We have been dreaming of changes in our country, just like what I hope for the people there at the Land Transportation Office, Parañaque, there is still a bus of Don Mariano bus that fell in the West service Road in Bicutan, Parañaque from the skyway southbound, which was passed last Monday morning after seven days ago.
There was a taking of life in Parañaque Doctors Hospital.
Why are LTO and LTFRB for first, this is the LTO's invention of ID, which is why many accidents on the road are gone, "right, I do not want to depend on how many accidents on the roads are," they have already watched, "said," do not want to depend on it, "they said," do not lose hope.
In LTFRB, no matter how bad the record of a bus companies, you still continue to allow those who are going to travel, why is it possible for them to depend on LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez himself to sit on April only?
Will there change?
