On the blind hand, the punishment is wrong?

Misuari further added the situation in our country, wait, do you still remember what he did in 2007, which killed many people?
Why did the Security Group allow Misuari to post bail in his imprisonment, that is why he is doing something because of his protests after he was fired as ARNC governor last 2001.
According to him from the barism, where the billions of funds will go there for the development of the places which are jurisdiction of ARMM), there are even those who were assigned to Malaysia, but this has not been proven.
This is what he is now, which is why some of them died while there are still members of our Navy Seal, how about that?
Who will be liable there?
Misuari himself denied that Misuari and other officials of the MNLF have denied that they are leading the trouble, they said, the military just wanted to have a trouble to bury the issue on pork barrel.
It's because you are you, you are always being fooled and would be deceived by what you are talking to?
The government explained that it has been the issue that Misuari committed suicide against the agreement of MNLF and our government for ten years, and now, it's only now that they have lost in the election, and just because they have lost in the election it's as long as they have lost their protests like a young man?
What will happen here is that, "in Lamitan, Basilan, the Abu victim was surrounded by the military but they were able to escape.
The Filipino is really pitiful because he is always feasts in front of the violent actions and threats of other forces of Tiktik for China, 3 centimeters.
Shouldn't those released by Misuari back then?
There, in the whole country, a number of thousands of families evacuated because of this tire and some businesses are affected in this new conflict.
Too much! It is already right! Those who are guilty will finally be held accountable for whoever they are!
You are very much fooled by the Filipinos!
