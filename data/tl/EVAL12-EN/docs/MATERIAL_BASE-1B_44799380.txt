Awooooooo in government.

One time, Erap Estrada called the judge and magistrate to dominate the sanctuary.
The accusation of Erap has a basis for the public judge and magistrate to take advantage of the criminal cases, most about the bribery.
But the case now of the magistrates of the Supreme Court is unique in the investigation of Malacanang, the Bureau of Internal Revenue and Congress.
Maybe next is the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to investigate the investigation of the Supreme Court.
Mister Noynoy Aquino is leading the campaign against the magistrates, Mister Noynoy Aquino, who is asking for criticism of harassment and the pork barrel (SALN) that the goal is to know if the content of their SALN is true.
This is after the SC approved the provisions of PDAF and DAP that the amount was given by Noynoy to the lawmakers and agencies of the government.
The defense of Noynoy is the defense of PDAF and DAP or pork barrel that he made the PDAF and DAP in good faith.
What would be the excuse of the SC for possible to have something wrong with their SALN?
Good faith that can also be the cause of the SC?
There is a saying that the end of the end of the Philippines and the case against the SC, maybe the reason why Noynoy and his companions are faith in raising the SC?
What is the purpose of the Palace in the investigation of the Supreme Court? Only one reason I see, the magistrates will not be impeached, and they will be removed from his position.
Noynoy has a warning before to the magistrates.
In the collision of the Executive Department and the committee, the third and Co-Equal Employment branch of the legislative department, who are also involved in the wrong use of PDAF and DAP, might get involved.
And that is what happened as EP-fried / Raul Valino.
