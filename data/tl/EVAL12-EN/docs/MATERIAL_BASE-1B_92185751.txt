Get kind, Mr. President.

Former President Arroyo should not jump from happiness even if the Ombudsman dismissed the graft case against him in relation to the said misuse of the P530 million fund of the OFWs.
Because of the cruelty shown by the administration, we hope that every time the cases of Arroyo will be disappointed, surely there will be a new complaint.
They will lose a big bag if they will allow to return to life.
Madame Gloria.
That is why our advice to President Noynoy Aquino is that even if he is not the adviser of the palace at the end of his term at noon of June 30, 2016 when it is very clean and no trace of corruption.
And hopefully, he will not have a mark of emphysema or any respiratory infections are being used to and Mary, so that he will not have a hard time for the next administration like what he is doing to the vehicle named Gloria.
The ball is full, Mister President, that is why you need to mingle with you.
