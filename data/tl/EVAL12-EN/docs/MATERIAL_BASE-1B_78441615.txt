Grace Poe is really annoyed but Cunanan is not able to win.

Later on the interview of the radio architect of Senator Grace Poe.
Senator Grace Poe believes that Dennis Alcoreza is a boss of the Technology) Center, when he said in the Senate that he would not earn Ma'am, Janet Napoles, the brains of the P10-billion pork barrel scam.
Because of that, they should file a perjury case or lying to Cunanan's case.
Senator Bong Revilla also wants to file a perjury case.
Bong was famous in his performance of the movie Pandian, who was first famous by Da King Fernando Poe, Jr., father of Grace, who was also an accused of the accusations against Grace and Bong with the accusation against Grace and Bong.
Bong is also famous in TV Patrol who made it a "Kautism," and the Split if it does not have anything to do with her involvement with Ma'am Napoles, mother of the business partner of Kovalev.
It can also be related to the coming election that all of these are Kovalev and Ma'am, Grace, are fighting for a lot of residents or vice president of our country.
But we are back to what he got annoyed with Dennis Alcoreza (not Deniece Cornejo) and we should focus on the case of aka David Tan who wants to be imprisoned by the Senate in lying but suddenly continued.
Why?
The allegation of Benhur Luy has seen a lot of money which Cunanan accepted to Ma'am Napoles.
"I received nothing," said Dennis.
Who among them is the liar for how to file a case against Ma'am Pilar?
Anyway, Bong was initially said to have told Benhur, whom he was.
Will Ma'am Pilar do this?
