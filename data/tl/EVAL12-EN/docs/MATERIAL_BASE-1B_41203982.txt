Cayetano was on top of De Lima By Eralyn Pritil, September 1, 2016.
Senator Leila de Lima is again reminding the statement of Senator Alan Peter Cayetano that there is no extrajudicial killings happening in the country.
The senator insisted that Cayetano is not just acting blind but he is just pretending not to see any extrajudicial killings in the country when the Duterte administration started the campaign against drugs.
"How Campton, said to be the extrajudicial killings, We-INTRIGAB, declared dead, dead-known in the name of the name of the Philippines," according to De Lima, the senator has doubts that the Philippine National Police (PNP) is doubting.
De Lima contradicted the statement of Cayetano that more dead were seen during the time of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Benigno Aquino III.
This is allegedly not true because it is clear that only in the two months of the Duterte administration, it has reached almost more than 2,000 pesos in relation to his campaign against drugs.
