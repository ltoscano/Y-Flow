The payment: Alfred Vargas, just laughed into as drug lord!
By Jojo Cabinet July 19, 2016, Quezon City 5th District House Representative Alfred Vargas was laughed because of the wrong thought that he was the drug lord Herbert Colangco who attended the birthday party of Justice Secretary Leila de Lima in the DOJ-list last August 2015.
The video of De Lima became viral while he was singing of why, along with the veteran singer Imelda Papin, and a boy named Colangco, which is insisting that he has a connection with drug lords.
Alfred released a statement as a proof that de Lima is going to correct her and not Colangco is true, she was asked to be careful when putting on his eyes.
But despite the clarification of those involved in the issue, there are people whose brain is closed because they are still insisting the boy with the story of the birthday party of De Lima, a sad part of social media.
It is clear that the evidence is clear but it is still not believed because the anger towards De Lima is clear and to save themselves in shame that they are the ones doing it.
De Lima was noticed by de Lima but they have not criticized the opportunities that the lady senator is saying and wrong about the senator's political number.
Korina Sanchez, Jessica Soque was left behind by Jay-R-R!
Jay-R, in the blame, became a drug addict and pleading that she is given a Second Chance!
The Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soque is the interview of Korina Sanchez in Jay-R IOS in Rated K this Sunday because it was first released by Jessica Soho's interview, but it was strongly denied that he is a drug pusher.
The part of Korina Sanchez has lost its meaning of what happened to the life of Jay-R.
Aside from the thick smoke in the interview of Korina Sanchez, the statement of Jay-R is the same statement in Rated K and in the memorial program, the Kapuso sitcom, Soho.
