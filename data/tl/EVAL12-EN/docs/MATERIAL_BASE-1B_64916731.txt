Calamities live again.

Because of the severe rain and flood, the province of Maguindanao has declared a state of calamity.
This is a sign, for the arrival of calamity when the rainy season comes.
Anywhere, the possibility of calamity is always there.
Those who attended the place are going to be hit, like the passing of typhoon Yolanda, Ondoy and other strong typhoons in Mindanao.
Those who were hit by the previous southwest monsoon are not safe.
A big question: How can we prepare against the calamities?
Do we already have a safe place?
Do we have nothing to pay for the evacuation centers?
The truth is, it is very hard to answer these questions, especially on the parts of the citizens.
That is why, the question is what is needed about the government.
No matter how much the government does not know how to be dynamic again, especially at the right time?
We are asking, because they are often absent and slow in the turtle in the midst of calamities, especially those in high positions in the government.
It is often said that even if they see that it can't be seen that it is not just a shoe and if they are going to places of calamity, they seem to be campaigning.
Make the wave, hand, hands and other kinds of dizziness.
Yes right, the election in 2016 is like the smell of this kind of scene in the area of calamity.
PNoy himself said, when he is campaigning for saying that we will vote for the leaders of 2016, we should not vote those who do not do anything but to sing and look at what is written on the story of the movie.
And what we will vote for is those who do not want to step down in flood and vote, and then they will wait to the people that they are guilty, why are they dying and suffering?
And if you ask help, it is up to your life! "What to answer!
King-mother of them.
Let us look at all those who are politicking, however, they are politicking now and then they are charged even if there is a calamity in Maguindanao today.
