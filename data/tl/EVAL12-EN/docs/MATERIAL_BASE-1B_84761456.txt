Graft and plunder cases, an assurance?

It is clear on the rays of the days that the left battle of PNP Chief General Alan Purisima is clear on the rays of the people who were charged and were not granted to their wishes for the said official.
The graft case will file the graft case of Perfecto Yasay, Purisima, an indication that this is destroying the credibility of Purisima.
In a roar of Tagalog, he admitted that he has no evidence or basis for the case that he is accused of the said general.
What is painful here, the credibility of a senator was destroyed when he looked into the issue.
But what is curious about this is that, why is it that even Arsenio Evangelista of VAvena, the regional director of Region 3, Purisima, was caught by the regional director of Region 3, Purisima, who was caught by the group of Evangelista, who was said to be the suspect in the murder of the son of Evangelista.
Also stated by PNP Sevidal person of General Retiro ac also stated that they are going to file a score of donation for the White House in PNP Crame.
Sindac even explained that the line of donation is being done after the-turn of the project, and it is not new to do the said project because it will be one donation for the skin.
Gambling in Pasig, did not stop.
The gambling operation of the couple Cris and Rose in Pasig went down again in Pasig.
Almost in the town of Pasig, the couple was conquered by the couple, which is almost exposed to be defeated by the said city.
The couple Cris and Rose were not able to talk about anyone, even the child is being removed from gambling.
