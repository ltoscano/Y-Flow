Oh, why is Pacquiao still fighting?
By Al G. this November 4, 2016 testified against Manny Pacquiao that everything is famous and rich.
But why did he return to boxing?
"I can still do it," he said when he turned his back on the barism that he built after he defeated Tim Bradley on Sunday against Jessie Vargas in Las Vegas.
It was his 67 year-old man and there was a record of 58-6-2.
I do not want to think that he will lose, but the accident is under my mind.
Vargas (age 27) and hang out of WBO World welterweight division did not start the record of 27-1.
Pacquiao is no longer a child because of December 17, he is already old.
In fact, in the last 6 fight of Pacquiao from 2012, he lost in Bradley and Marquez 2012, Mayweather 2015).
It has been no strong strength for the last 3 wins as his last 3 wins (Rios 2013, Algieri 2014, Bradley 2015).

It was last 2009 when my last win was against Miguel Cotto.
That's why he only defeated Vargas (tall-4 inches) in the point that he has to pass the jail when he arrived in a deep sleep.
But the win or win, Pacquiao will still earn millions of dollars.
Is the money really the reason why he is against him?
