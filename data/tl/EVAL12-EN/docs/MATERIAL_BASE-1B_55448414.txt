Who is the real patriot?

Are you a lot of friends?

In this time, only a few of your true friends are true and not everyone is true and others are being judgemental and you need to just need a little favor.

What is difficult in your part of a friend is true to him but not, there are times that you should put something in exchange even if you have not made a way so that whatever time you call or drive there, you can't resist you.

Sometimes, because you are true that you are not thinking if what you are doing is right or you have a time to yourself or family.

In business, is it right that you are always free, sometimes it cannot be avoided because you have a relationship because if you have a relationship with you, right?

Sometimes, you will be hard to weigh out from a friend or family once, when you have a transaction about money and there is an equivalent in a big commission, expect that he will make a way for you to have an agreement or to give you it especially when you do not have an agreement.

You have a friend whom you think is for you and whatever he has, you are like you, but because you do not think that it is always like that because in the end you can still look for your things?

Do you notice that you are like a orders? Yes, those who do not want to do you are real friends, that's why you're the one who is at fault and that is what we should avoid, because this is what we should avoid, because this is what we should avoid.

So now, I have already learned about it because that is what I have been saying now, it seems that you are just used to use the life of your world now, but if it is true that you are always taking care of it, but now, it is not all that you prioritize, but hopefully, not all of your friends, but hopefully, it's not all that you're going to focus or not true.
