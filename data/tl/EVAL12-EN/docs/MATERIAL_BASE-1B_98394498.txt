By Bam Aquino this November 3, 2016, the protagonist is one of the important proposed laws that we are pushing as chairman of Committee on Education (COCs) but aside from your servant, five more senators are able to submit a proposal to make free education in SUCs).
Though these proposals are different and details of these proposals, there is only one direction that the unfortunate of our countrymen who want to end up in the said proposition will be held by different sectors that gave their comment and suggestion regarding the proposed law.
Some sectors already expressed their fear, especially in the departure of students from private school when they made free from SUCs.
Another fear is how the proposal will be implemented on those who said that he should have chosen the type of course, and there are other proposals that he is focused on the ability of the student to pay.
Some are saying that even if there is something or not, just inside SUCs, education should be free.
Aside from agriculture, others are also in favor of the proposition to be brought inside the proposal in the implementation of the proposal to help those who are in need to help those in need.
This is just some of the issues that needs to be resolved in order to ensure that it will fulfill his desire to give free education in college but the poor are still determined.
That's why it is scheduled to conduct a few working groups together with different sectors to be able to talk about and solve the fated issue.
