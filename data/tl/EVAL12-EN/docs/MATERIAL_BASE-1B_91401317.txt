Witnesses: The truth is By Jimmy Cantos, on September 12, 2016.
The truth came out that's why Pacman returned to the ring because he still did not accept his defeat against Floyd Mayweather, Jr. last year.
This is coming from his masculinity, Freddie Roach.
In an interview, Roach said that this is what Roach said, that he / she really loves Mayweather back in the ring (out of) if he would be able to imitate Mayweather when he returned to the ring while Jessie Vargas of Mexico, the World Boxing Organization welterweight champion.
They are scheduled to face November 6 in Las Vegas in Las Vegas where Pacman also fought for several times of the said game, 19,000 but sold the 7,000 dollars to be sold at the amount of 50 US dollars.
"He / she was able to go back to the presence of the fans that he / she has been looking for.

He / she was able to attend to $50.
For those who are asking about the rights of Vargas as the opponent of Pacman, his record is 27-1 that has ten years old while Pacman has a record of 58-6-2.
Pacman is no longer a child when his 38th birthday is approaching on December while 27 years old.
Roach is convinced that it is the reason of Pacman's Vargas fight, Roach said that Pacman can do something when he defeated Timothy Bradley in America last April in Las Vegas.
"We-an agreement that he will be the one to take a hidden case, which is why he / she had a hidden talent, he / she was able to make the fight that was lost, the fight fight, he / she was able to show his / her chance to go out of Manny," said Roach.

If Pacman will follow Vargas, Roach is expecting that Mayweather will go back to the ring if Mayweather will remain retired, to target the camp of Pacman and Crawford (28-year-old WBO) outpost in the welterweight champion.
Roach's insult was simple.
"Crawford (Crawford (Crawford (UVR 984).
Daang Matuwid will run as a move, it seems Mayweather also does not have anything to do but run in the time of the fight.
