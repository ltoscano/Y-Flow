Fix the system of PCSO.

The oral argument set by the Supreme Court about the legality of the Priority Development Assistance Fund and Disbursement Acceleration Program which is both known for the call of pork barrel scam, which are both known as the call of pork barrel scam, is at stake in this issue that was being played by some officials and the people's money.
These past few days, I personally witnessed how hard our poor countrymen are experiencing and asking for help from government agencies, like the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office.

But when he arrived at PCSO, he reached more intense difficulty with the thousands like him who are hoping for help in PCSO Chairman and because they are always animals, they seem to be an animal if Malacanang is treated in the strict security.
It seems that they are really difficult with the system to surrender the people and do not go back and do not go back and do not go back and do not think about those such as Janet Lim-Napoles, who were not able to think about it, like what they are doing to the poor.
So at last, the "victim was extremely hurt, his mother was crushed, it means that it was far from the amount of money that was given to him in front of these events but it is just right that the system is going to change about the way of the expenses of the country.
This should not leave the hands of the few and instead, it should be used in the right way and welfare of many of the poor people.
