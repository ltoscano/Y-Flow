Yes, yes, yes, I said yes, ah, it's okay that I am going home a while ago when I was still talking to me, my head-in-law, whose head.
Me, where are you now?
Because you are in the house at home.
Okay, because if I have not left you right now, I do not know how to look pitiful; but I don't know how to look pitiful; but I don't know that we are stupid; I don't know that we are loyal; we are not aware;
"Why didn't you go with your mother, why didn't you go with your mother, I am not here in the mall when you were not only here in the mall, that's why when it's okay, that's why it's okay to have a little bit of little by little.
Ah, what's that, because they are fixing that kind of age, they will be united; there is a good thing that is okay.
Okay, okay, okay, it was brought by a day we are going to each other last night, so we can go there last night when I go there in the house last night.
I went to you last night, so it is traffic here and what yes.
We have nothing to give in.
Baby was outside exactly one o'clock.
Jenny Reyes, as a while, father, to visit now, was able to visit now that's why we were able to visit now that's why we were able to wake up; that's why we wake up with each other.
I said it's because I told him.
