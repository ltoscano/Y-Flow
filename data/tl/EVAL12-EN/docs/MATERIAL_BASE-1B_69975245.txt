There is a need to always bathe.

My laughter will be more fiery than dignity.

It is more fiery than money, and it will be more harder to taste the heart instead of prayer.

Have you experienced those who laughed with a tears?

Your breathing can almost stop and hurt if all of us are not going to.

If the soap is for the body, laughing is for the soul that you are not poor if you do not want to laugh.

This is also a sign that you can face any problem in life when there is a smile on the lips, most of us are suspicious and ashamed because when you make sure that you are lost in the head, there is a bad belief that you cannot understand what you are laughing from our health.

Since we were still young, the old people were first beaten by the elderly not to laugh and be serious in life, but he respects the things according to them, instead, we are ashamed to talk to others, and we might be ashamed to talk to others, and might be ashamed that our mind will be shallow.

While in just a little pretending to be like others, there are some of us who get laughing even if the joke is rotten.

Laughing, we are one of the gifts to us as a person because, as long as I feel pity and sadness when you accept it, you will be able to breathe easier when you accept your true nature, to laugh everything and continue to move forward without fear.

It is the trait of real Filipinos in any gathering of a joke, this is what is showing our tradition; and when it comes to laughter, we have no one-control but to be happy.

Do you know a joke?
