The DSWD is negligent.

What are DSWD Secretary Dinky Soliman busy with?
According to the corner of the corner, the person who does not do is useless, especially if this person is an official of the government and they take advantage from the tax of the people.
Every day we go through the back of the Manila Papal Office to Liwasang Bonifacio going to the office of Remate in Intramuros, I can still see the youth who have long been broken by their parents who have not been neglected by their parents.
It is sad because it seems like there is no good future waiting for these youth.
It is also there in that place where other people who have gone home are there in the place where they have seen a woman pregnant, what if he had a baby pregnant, he might have grew up and will be able to go up to those who have gone down.
And not only in the Papal Office, in every corner of Manila, the children who had a heated argument ended up if Ma'am Pilar Dinky Soliman, he will see this truth.
To our youth, it is lead to a path.
Does the DSWD do not do anything to do?
If DSWD will be the problem of DSWD, it always comes back to the streets of young children, even if they are repeating it, they do not have a concrete program to make them learn and save their bad habits.
Do not go away from the provinces just like the DSWD in Metro Manila and they will see many of our countrymen who have no house, living on the streets and youth who were neglected in making evil.
