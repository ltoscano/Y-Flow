Don't have a good timing.

It looks like the statement of President Benigno Aquino III and even the congressmen in the leadership of House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte, Junior is not timely.
Even though I believe that the country should strengthen the fight in terrorism, for me, it is no longer needed to be exported and just do it properly and quiet.
Especially since Pope Francis is scheduled to visit the country next year and it is not possible that there is a threat for his security and safety.
And because of the initial statement of Noynoy, it is not impossible that militant Muslims will not think that this is a challenge to their ability.
Although the fighting in terrorism does not choose any day, it is better to be careful and vigilant of our security forces especially those in the intelligence community.
At present, it was said that the management of the police and the military maintained that they have not received any kind of threat from the arrival of the Pope.
But if we will test the experience, there is no need to accept threats to know that terrorists are planning something bad.
Just like an example in 1995 when Pope John Paul II is visited in the country, where is it is a assassination that was called Oplan Bowie, which is unintentionally stopped by our police.
If there was not only a fire in the apartment that was built by the terrorists that became the reason for the firefighters and police to responded, that might have something bad to happen to the Pope.
And if it's like that, it is a very big embarrassment for our side of Filipinos who are considered to be the only one to catholic countries in the region of Asia.
The intelligence firemen of the United States are still sleeping in a noodle house in the World Trade Center bombing last September, 11, 2001.
In other words, we should always be careful and vigilant, especially our authorities because we do not know and will not tell us that they will attack and vote for the violence.
