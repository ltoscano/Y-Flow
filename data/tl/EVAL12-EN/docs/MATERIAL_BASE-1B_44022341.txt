K + 12 junked.

When the children came to school in this year, in a rumble were the teachers of the public and the sanctity of what they can do for grade 9.
King-mother, there is nothing ready to blame or sure that the children are studying.
On September of October, it will be said that DepEd is going to have the teachers who are studying what they are studying before, "that's the first time," it is only temporary!
Even back then, we already felt that there is a problem with the K + 12 of Arlus said that there is a blessing from PNoy.
As long as long, the big problems that have the twin of K + 12 are coming out.
In 2016, from grade 11 and 2017 for grade 12, it appears that the classroom will become a big problem.
In Metro Manila, especially now, it appears that there is almost no lot of land for the new buildings of DepEd.
It will be more felt in the transfer of children from the SEA Games because of the suffering that their lives are suffering.
"It was said that PNoy did not show up to the State of the Nation Address last year, which was built on the classroom, just for 2010.
Luistro also put PNoy in a fake news so PNoy would just be able to sing on his boss?
It is also a huge problem where he will be stabbed at around 85,000 teachers in college for the First and Second, which will be hit by the K-11 and K-12.
These photos of government officials were made of action by the programs but there is no clear solution for those who appear and big problems.
Before the education of the youth can still be placed under the canal, can we also be used to the Americans but there is no corresponding fund, materials, people and others?
In my opinion, it is good to support the proposal of Senator Antonio Trillanes IV that the K + 12 will be charged until the problem here will be the cause of the derailing of education, lives of teachers and citizens.
