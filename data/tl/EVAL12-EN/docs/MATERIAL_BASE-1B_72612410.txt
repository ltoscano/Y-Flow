Hi-October 3: Bad or good?

"Krrrik," that's the time that I call for the big change in our society currently, which is why the members of the third sex, particularly those who have noticed that it seems like in a kind of high blood, is not less than 4 or more.
I asked my companion why this is what happened, but even he cannot answer anything, what is the reason why there is a "tanim-INGROs), which is because of climate change?
There are those who are saying that the change in the weather and worsening pollution is the cause of the apathal system, that is why there are more than a man who goes to a man, and this is the cause why a man is becoming coop in a case against women.
But it is certain that the church will not agree with this kind of argument and for them, these things, particularly the issue of LGBT which has been a priest who said that this is an illness that can be treated.
Is it positive or not the increase of LGBT (WHO, gay, transgender Jennifer) in the society? If I will be asked, there is no one who will be asked, but this is with the ability and life that should not be judged by the people based on this.
Are you saying that if you are being asked why are they increasing in number? Is this positive or not?
