Duterte was elected by "sorry" - Lacson By Boyet Jihadist, October 4, 2016.
If President Rodrigo Duterte once again apologized to the bad statement, the value of its bottom is reduced and it seems that the people are just fooling us, according to a senator.
Senator Panfilo Lacson said this after President Duterte asked for an apology about his statement on Friday that if Adolf Hitler was killed by millions of the Jews, he will be able to kill 3 million addicts in the Philippines.
It can be recalled that it reached 6 million tourists who were brought by Hitler in the World War 2 just because of the belief that this is giving a bad luck in Germany on that time, according to Lacson, the importance of burial of President Duterte will be reduced if he is moving forward to the public's statements.
"You know, that should be lessened but he should be careful with what I am saying so that you should feel sorry," that is why we need to apologize to you, "said that he should be ashamed of what to say," said Lacson.
According to him, this will not happen again for the apology of the President because if it will be repeated, it seems that he is just fooling the people.
