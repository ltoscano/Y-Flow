Good needs.

What happened next is an important part of leadership.

We need to be silent before we do not want to listen.

We need to listen before we can learn.

We need to learn before we can prepare.

We need to prepare before we can serve from serving.

We need to serve before we can lead.

We need this: Our minds have the ability to endure those with no certainty.

Do you know, that while darkness continue, you can see the stars?

Even if the heavens is dark and there is a looming calamity, it will still pass, and the day will be completed.

You will easily meet the person what is happening about others than to know him what others are doing about him.

We should learn how to wait for an inspiration before doing it.

Action is always start to have an inspiration because it will never start moving.

Some said that all happy people have a God in their depths.

Because you believe that I have the ability to act as gentlemen, I did it.

There is always space between intention and action.

Life is as if life is a short or life, it depends on how you will bring you two choice; and control your mind, or, let you control you.
