MILF endorsed SMAS.

The residents of ARMM came close to the start of the campaign last February 13, 2013 for the candidates for the national level and partylist even if it is said that the Liberal Party and United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) started to have a foul smell.
One reason, he said, is the lack of candidate coming from the region that in the opinion of some are the very first time that the ruling or opposition who are part of their ticket were not included.
The region did not fall short to having politicians who can be put to face even though it was thrown in the past two consecutive kinds of scandals, like Adel Tamano, who became spokesman of Uno but eventually transferred to Senator Manny Villar.
In a survey, the loss of the National Bureau of a candidate was seen as a big obstacle to be one of the witnesses.
On the other hand, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front led the candidacy of OIC Regional Governor Migz Villafuerte in order for the coming 2013 elections.
According to a known leader of ARMM, who does not want to identify themselves due to the sensitive to his position, the MILF Chairman of Murray asked the help of the rebel group in Hataman.
According to the payment, Murad ordered the form of the all the 25th anniversary team in the five provinces of ARMM, which included Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Basilan.
It is good for the rebel groups to win the victory of Hataman from the famous party of PNoy after they found out his readiness to step down from his position in the coming 2015 to give space to the form of Bangsamoro in exchange of ARMM.
It is not a joke that a official, which we know all that he will be in service in his position, is not a joke that is based on the appointed Constitution.
