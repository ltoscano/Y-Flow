The surrounding is green.

It is saddening that the elementary and high school students, now do not know the true story of EDSA Revolution.
Someone came out of a newspaper at the answers of some youth who were asked about what they know about what they know during the 25th of February. The report of the youth, but it is saddening that it is sad.
We might also be blamed for these children, because maybe their parents have lost interest in the memory of EDSA Revolution, or they are also disappointed with the situation now in our politics, that is why they are not disappointed with their children the real government and placed under a peaceful government through a peaceful or full of less.
What can be the lesson from EDSA if we are compared to the sectors that are happening in other countries now, where many are hurt and killed, many are damaged and properties.
In the EDSA Revolution of us, 28 years have passed, we became an inspiration in many countries and the Philippines became an inspiration because in spite of what is happening now, many are trying to destroy the remaining memory of EDSA that's why some are trying to destroy the remaining memory of EDSA.
For me, and as a parent, what I want to leave the memory of EDSA to my children is the success of the Filipinos before yesterday that there is nothing related to the success of the Philippines in EDSA that's why there is nothing related to the success of the Philippines against extreme corruption before, against the discrimination and abuse.
