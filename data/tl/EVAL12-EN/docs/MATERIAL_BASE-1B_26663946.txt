Relatives of the witness: Solaels of Saints Peter and Paul, Alum ,-year-old, June 29, 2014 - is the year of the Laqueza.

We celebrate today the feast of San Pedro and San Pablo, and we also believe that this kind of faith in Christ, "we can say that we have been jealous of our faith," if we have witnessed what we have witnessed in our faith, "if we have witnessed what we have witnessed in our faith," if we have witnessed what we have witnessed in our faith, "if we have witnessed what we have witnessed in our faith," if we have witnessed what we have witnessed in our faith, "if we have witnessed what we have witnessed in our faith," if we have witnessed what we have witnessed, "San Pedro, that we should learn how to die," San Pedro, that we should pray for us!
