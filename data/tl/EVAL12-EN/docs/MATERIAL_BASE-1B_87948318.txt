PRRD should be proud of every Filipino in any country.
BE with Dacer-September 9, 2016.
I rarely see a leader whom I need has a unique trait that I can see that no one else has passed by our country for six-years in their service, in the past administrations that I can say that many have been lacking.
First of this is the problem with the crime, especially the root of all these kinds of drugs.
It's just good to think that only one Rodrigo Roa Duterte is the only one we are waiting for to voluntarily surrender to our country the reason why every country has no right to give a lecture on what kind of country is, and we have no right to give a lecture on what kind of country and leadership we have.
It seems that it is just good to say and be proud of other countries that we look for our Filipinos now, that we have been given dignity especially our fellow Filipino Workers (OFW) for the courage and concern of our leaders in our country.
That is why even if we are not of our fellowmen, you have read about PRRD, I cannot be amazed.
Some of us only ask for help from our fellow OFWs in another country, one of the former poor people who were poor of repatriation of our country or repatriation if the media does not allow it to be very fast now in our current administration.
That is why, why is it that since then, it is not just a year if our countrymen, PRRD, is the only one who can do this for some years of suffering from some of our fellowmen abroad.
To someone like me who is going to go to the daily tasks, the problem of our fellow countrymen is to be proud of what our government is doing now.
