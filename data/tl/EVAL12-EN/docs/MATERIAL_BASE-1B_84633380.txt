God of the light.

Ginger Conejero - Father Edwards B. Liwag.

Every first week of January, we celebrated our fellow feast of giving God to the New Year, a new life!
That there is hope, according to Ib, we will be clear like this day. "
As early as now, we are calling the visit of the three Dilawan, Jesus Christ, the rays of the record in space, they have proven that they are the ones who have witnessed what happened in their visit to the baby Jesus Christ, they have proven that they were one of those who witnessed their visit to the infant, Jesus.
The gold medal can become the idol of God who was born as a symbol of the priest of Jesus in Bagong Tindan, that their visit to those who suffered a lesson in spite of the challenges and danger they did not come true, after all, they suddenly disappeared.
They know that the child of God is what they visited, they have no idea that in exchange for their gifts, what is important is that they are proud of our fellowmen, especially our love, especially our love, understanding and help to those in need.
