Emergency powers BE is Junila, September 4, 2016, the proposal to give an emergency powers by President Rodrigo Duterte to solve the problem of traffic.
It seems that Department of Transportation Secretary Art Tugade told Senator Grace Poe because he does not show any plan on how they will use the emergency powers so that our roads will not be allowed.
The senators are not against the proposal because they just want to ensure that the emergency powers are not being abused, for me, it does not need an emergency powers to fix the traffic.
The political will only have the political will and what we should do for so long and what should be done is what they have done and there are even acts of Japanese - but there is still no change.
What is needed is to do this permanent solution, even if it is expensive, even if it is poor.
Because if we do not waste the problem, the problem will worsen.
I'm greeting my daughter Dominic Ocampo this September 4, tomorrow it will celebrate the 120th birthday of my mother-in-law Anita and my mother-in-law.
