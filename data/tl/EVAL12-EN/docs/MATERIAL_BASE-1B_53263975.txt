Being treated is a total increase in anti-drug campaign of the Duterte administration with the leadership of the Philippine National Police (PNP).
This is due to the murder of the small-time-time people involved in the operation of illegal drugs.
Based on the comment of the critics, the small drug pushers and killed were quickly killed, while the mayor, who responded to the White House of PNP like Albuera Mayor Ronald "Bato" dela Rosa and said that the other involved in illegal drugs were immediately defended by PNP Chief Ronald "Bato" dela Rosa and said that other people involved in the operation of illegal drugs were immediately defended by PNP Chief Ronald "Bato" dela Rosa.
If the pulse of our fellow countrymen is really a basis, that is why the PNP should show and prove that everything is fair and there is no solid evidence involving them to the syndicate, that is why there is no solid evidence related to them by the syndicate, that is why it's as if it is just one of the numerous evidence related to the syndicates.
In our opinion, if it surfaced and admitted that the case is related to illegal drugs, it seems that no one is going to go home to their homes which is far away from the ordinary citizens who are involved in illegal drugs in their respective community.
