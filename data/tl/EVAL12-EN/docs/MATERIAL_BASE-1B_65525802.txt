The real government is pitiful.

The fight is really serious now with the Aquino administration because it is not that for the improvement of the economy of the country, the leadership of the country will not make sure how the mistakes of those who are in position will not be removed.
Most of the pet officials of the government have fallen, from relatives, friends, classmates and Kabarilan of President Benigno Aquino, if not even from the President.
These are all who wish to be elected in position to earn money, not only to recover the money they spent for those who are spending to each other but to strengthen their lives more.
That is why the people in the government are pitiful, those who worked in the government using their own intelligence and hard work because they are just being stepped on even though they are qualified for a high position.
When will the government focus on it, especially now that President Aquino is seated, the rights of the employees past to Civil Service examination?
How will the employees who take advantage of the eyebrows will rise in order to pass the civil service to pass, if they are always qualified, it will just be protected by those who are not qualified is close to Ponong Pilot?
What President Noynoy should take care of now is how to fix the course of the country especially in the economy of the country, it is said that the economy of the country will be strengthened even if the ordinary citizens are feeling?
The business of the rich is obvious but the poor workers, how, are the friends of the friends of the friend of the friend of the friend of the friend of the friend of the family who are giving their livelihood to the poor that they have not been paid properly.
