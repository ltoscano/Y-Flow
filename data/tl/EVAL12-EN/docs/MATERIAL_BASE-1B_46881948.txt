This is unlikely.

It seems that the dream of Ping Lacson to help the Aquino administration is going to help the Aquino administration, especially when there are many dreams in 2016 election, the one who has dreams in the 2016 elections, the one who has dreams in the 2016 elections, is the one who has dreams in the 2016 election, the matter how much his ambition is to become the president of the country.
To our acquaintance, not only the party of President Noynoy Aquino to the Liberal Party is not the only ones who have ambition in the country because all those who have ambition in 2016 are against reappointed by the former senator, especially since they know that it can be used in the said position to be enched.
It is clear in the present are Senator Mar Roxas, Chiz Escudero, Alan Cayetano and VP Jojo Binay, those who are allies of PNoy who have her ambition to become president of the country, that is why they are just starting to crush the former lawmaker who is in Cavite especially now that they were not able to join the pork barrel or the Priority Development Assistance Fund in the body.
It's because Lacson was the only lawmaker who did not accept his pork barrel fund since it became a senator because aside from what he knows that he is illegal, he is still full of elements of corruption.
We all know that people do not want the corrupt, especially those who received pork barrel, that is why it is only here that Lacson immediately responded to the people.
Another reason is that the news being harassed by Lacson has already exploded that is why this is already happening that this is one of the Presidential dees of 2016 where he will form his own ticket.
Mister CDO is Ping Lacson to the public now that is why the traditional politicians in the country are afraid because they know that the people are looking for an alternative person who will give protection to the state of the state that comes from people.
