Trust of the wife By Kuya Rom July 27, 2016.
Dear Kuya Rom.
I and my husband are the same focused on working and raising to our two children, I love him and he loves me too much, we also love the children, that we almost do not have time for each other.
Once we watch out of TV, someone called me and I need to stand, go away from my husband when I noticed that I was surprised when I noticed that my husband suddenly got sick and I was quiet and I was quiet and I did not know why.
He seems to be jealous, as if we have a relationship with my friend, even if I am living with a tomboy.
But now, it seems that he has no trust in me, do I need to do so that my husband will continue to trust me?
Dear Minda.
Give attention to the things that should be given first in English which is important because aside from working, it is important that your priorities will be popular.
First, your relationship with God and prayer is second, your relationship with your husband and romance is second, the presence of your children's life.
It means, live by a person who has been taking care of your priorities is to distribute your time for every priority so you will not be swayed or negligence.
Everyday, pray that God will continue to give you knowledge to do everything that is important to your romance, your relationship with your husband.
Give this time to do this priority to avoid jealousy from your spouse.
If it is true that you are not doing anything wrong, understand that your husband's jealousy is coming from you and you should wait for the moment your husband is in a happy mood to talk to her.
Ask him about the relationship of her father and mother before.
Your prayer to God is that may he act on your husband's life so that your husband's life is the root of jealousy and the God will answer your relationship with your spouse.
