The Philippines can't face any kind of threat to our security because our military cannot deny it, that's when our military bleeds.
As long as now, our military is ready for the destruction of weapons and other military on top, what happened to the AFP modernization program?
We had an intensive conversation and sold the private parts of the military so that they can collect the funds to buy modern equipment.
President Noynoy said, that is why China is able to make it a pitcher.
If I will be up to him, I will not ask a foreign help in front of a chambers of China in the West Philippine Sea, but it is no longer for others to surrender your sovereignty.
Many are fighting back especially on the side of the militants against the signed Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) of the Philippines and the USA in visiting this recently of US President Obama.

Malaca√±ang denied that we were the one who asked America to complete the agreement of the Palace, the EDCA was formed because of the understanding between the Philippines and the US in the held 2-NUCD-2 meeting in Washington DC last 2012.
This is in the middle of the critics of the administration about their agreement that they are pleading to complete an agreement because of China's bullying.
But if we cannot help us in front of the threats of China in our own territory, why would we taste the help of other countries like America?
But, the protesters are almost visible or with color of depression, it is noticeable that America is being endorsed while in the reported threats of the communists, they are just going to be blamed.
