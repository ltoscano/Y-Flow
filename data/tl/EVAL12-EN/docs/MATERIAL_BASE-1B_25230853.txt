The argument of Koko Pimentel in the ICC is wrong.

Senator Aquilino "Koko" Pimentel III confirmed the statement that he thinks, there is no need for the next hearing of the Senate in the anomalous construction of the Iloilo Convention Center (ICC).
Senator Koko Pimentel said that the witness has lost its credibility because it is said that one of the things that he used to prove that the ICC was the data from Wikipedia.
If the argument of Senator Koko "in my opinion is that they should stop the hearing of the blue ribbon committee of the Makati City Hall and 2.
But I am mistaken, in the first part of the hearing in the said anomaly, their witness Atty. Bondal and Wikipedia, to prove that there is an anomaly in building the said building.
I am not saying it is not right to use Wikipedia in the two said issue, however, I just want to be able to criticize Bondal when he once used it.
Many are thinking that because they are involved in the ICC anomaly, Senate President Franklin Drilon will be involved in the ICC anomaly, which is why they are quick in deciding who should stop when this incident happened.
What I know is that although Mejorada did not insist on his allegation, there are more other sweetened bying people who are scheduled to be called by the blue ribbon committee.
Maybe the people should just listen to what they will say for the same time to know the truth behind the allegation of Mejorada as Drilon regarding the ICC.
When the arrival of the conclusion, the people in the crispiness of the conclusion, it is certain that the people in the crispiness of the Pambansang Kamao will surely be able to ask the ICC's the ICC) to be able to meet the ICC).
