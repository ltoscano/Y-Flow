Stand.

Do not worry to face and keep on the things you believe, even if it is your alone.

Let us remember or not, there are many opportunities coming in our life that we feel alone in danger, if we continue to follow your heart and your conscience and it is clear that you feel that it is right, no matter how other people think about it.

Many of us are able to leave and avoid what is right and just because of the reason why many of our countrymen continue to meddle with it, "as they do not want to meddle with it," they don't want to get involved and fight for their rights.

Ever, you will not wake up every morning that it is happening for the thousands of surrender of your resolve and inhumane treatment of your fellow, only two movement is happening here: Those who patronize it: Those who patronize it, or those who are guilty.

Many of us still continue to sleep, sleeping, and trying to sleep on each other when we can wake up if it is only desired.
