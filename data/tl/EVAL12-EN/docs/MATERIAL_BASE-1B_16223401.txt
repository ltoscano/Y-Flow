Under the "case of Talk" Noel Abuan, July 28, 2016 was rushed by the Department of Labor Law (DOLE), which aims to reduce 50 percent of the "ENDO" before the year 2016 ends.
This is what DOLE Sec. Wanda Teo and Bello said, where he ordered all the DOLE Regional Committee to start cleaning the companies which are implementing "ENDO."
"But according to me, it is better to lessen the crooked path of 50-percent in the end of 2016," Bello said that the workers are receiving higher wages and have no benefits like the Social Security System (SSS), Pag-love and PhilHealth.
"Times of establishments that the workers implement illegal substance, holidays, and other benefits," said Bello.
In the first senior citizens meeting (SOM) of the department, Bello ordered the DOLE Regional Trial Court to submit a list of establishments that implement Martial Law.
In the said list, the DOLE Regional Office will know which of those establishments are using the "ENDO."
Bello also added that there are proposals that will come from different groups of workers how to prove the physical abuse or "selfies" in our country.
The said numbers, from going down and annulment of Department of 18-A, is currently being studied by Undersecretary Joel Magcities with other officials of the department.
