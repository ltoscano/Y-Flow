New police versus Kotong!

It is likely that deceased Secretary Jesse Robredo is likely to be light from his cemetery because of the mystery that came from his cabinet, the Department of the Interior and Local Government.
These past few days, it was confirmed that DILG Undersecretary Rico Puno already attacked the house and office of Robredo to convince the alleged "sensitive documents.
Atty. Leni Robredo himself said that Puno already did this and he needs to ask for help from Justice Secretary Leila de Lima to guard their house in Metro Manila.
De Lima also admitted that, but because he is a good puppy, he said he does not know anything about sensitive documents.
"Before the news surfaced, Rico Puno suddenly appeared at almost a billion peso contract in the PNP to buy a gun from his friend.
The guns, 59,74 pieces of Glock will come from the trust trade and partner of Glock Asia Pacific Pacific Economic Cooperation from Hong Kong.
Even though a gun is cheaper by P165,00, it still loves the price of Kelle group.
The approval of the day to declare Mar Roxas is the secretary of DILG.
Isn't it right for the Undersecretary to wait for the decision of the new Secretary before doing any steps?
Why is it that Rico Puno is very strong in these kinds of decisions? There is no fear, just for Robredo and now in Roxas.
Is he going to be in a hurry because there really is something wrong about him?
What is the content of the said investigation of Robredo in the PNP and almost all the officials of the PNP who have been the mistress of Rico Puno in Crame, it is being mentioned just like a sound.
It seems that it is deep, and it is scary to the authorities about the last action of the hand-called Secretary Robredo.
And when Aquino administration has not faced this issue of correct, this will surely be the ghost in his "straight path."
