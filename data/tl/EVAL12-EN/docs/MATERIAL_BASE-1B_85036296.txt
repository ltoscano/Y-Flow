14, PNoy talked to the family of the SAF 44.

President Noynoy Aquino made up for the families of SAF 44 that were opened to the NCRPO Custodial Center in Camp Bagong Diwa in Bicutan, Taguig City.
The President has reached 14 hours for the families of the Fallen 44.
He promised enough help and justice to the families.
At this point, it was a huge wave at the will of those left by the SAF 44 that were killed in the arrest of the SAF 44 that were killed inside the arrest of the MILF this past Sunday.
Yes, PNoy really made up for his not welcome to the company of SAF 44 in Villamor Air Base last Thursday, because he chose to socialize "in a car show in Laguna due to the extreme criticisms that he reached especially in social media.
The problem now of PNoy is the call of the majority for the suspension of the Bangsamoro Basic Law between the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the government.
How are you, Mister President?
Let us just wait for the next events that will happen in the very fresh issue.
Long live the Philippines... there is a country, one spirit, one AFP and one PNP!
