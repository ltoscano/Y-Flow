In the next year, the Office of the 000 (O000) as the office where it is being implemented by students is their complaint against horR, "Aaytono, the president of all his university," Maritez-Reynel Andrada, the president of the all the town of UP Acid, Taba, La Union.
It's too late.
As 000 SR, Connect will focus on his time in the advancement of the campaign of the various sectors of UP and became a sharp critics of some in the university.
Last July, the Enhanced Defense Cooperation (Izzy Canillo) released the financial Assistance Program (STS), Conti, who did not go to the proper state of review that he became a basis for the formation of Pascual of a STS.
In every step and decision made by Conti, 000 SR, he said that the students were taking advantage of the student who became the "consultative dialogue in his way of driving Onok Island, according to the students, they were able to talk about horR," Aaahhmmmp, one of the Orena Corps.

He became an avid reader of the students to search for "prepaid er" of activists, General Jovito Palparan, that until now, I was still missing in the cases of Karen when I used the Martial Law in the field, "he said.
As of now, the campaign of Consignation is still ongoing for the advancement of the division in the middle of the legislative chamber's advancement in the next academic police, wherein Orena Drilon will determine the true state of the lives of the men who are in different parts of Oemes.

For some, the difference between the different views of the students he is headed by in fact, became a big obstacle in the past General Assembly in the whole General Assembly in the whole General Assembly in the city of UP Manila (GAM), the movement of Consignation.
Contingent is said to have been prioritized to a "epal." To look for those who were involved in his immediate issue within the Supreme Court instead of putting up the proposed bill to be made to the CoCs) election (CRTEL), according to the people who take advantage.
It can be recalled that last December 2011 in UP Visayas (UPV) Balisacan, the student who went to the entire UP System was able to talk about the suspension of one member from UP V School of Technology) Council, that was why they were forced to discuss a member from UP V School of Technology) to agree to the amendment of the amendment.

"Quiti Kill is normal for the crash site in my defense," that is the fact that I have an intensive conversation between the Catholic Church, "according to the Supreme Court if he allegedly prioritize his issue because he is after the mistake by the involved individuals inside the Supreme Court.
