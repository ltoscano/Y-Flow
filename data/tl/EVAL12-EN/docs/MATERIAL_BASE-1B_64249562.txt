Because up to now, there is still no clear result in the order of the DILG boss to Gatchalian to clean the region of lawless elements.
And in the issue of the operation of illegal drugs, the request of Roxas to Gatchalian is "No." Policy "but the fact is the declaration of the policy" the existing law. "
Why are we saying this?

You will cheat on you, do not just call the Batangenos that it's going to be erased from the "distress operation of illegal drugs in Batangas.
