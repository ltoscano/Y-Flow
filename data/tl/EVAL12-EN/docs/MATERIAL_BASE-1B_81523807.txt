Wake up!

The person who knows, if he is resting is his safety, he cannot forget about the danger he will come and he is ready in danger, and he is ready in danger, and his properties, livelihood, and his relatives are intentionally being taken care of.

But what else will be done, especially our hope of the country that the government does not know, if no one is looking at them, it will be certain that even if they want to go to a knife, they will surely want to support the colonizers.

No matter what kind of tasks, they have entered, and for their bodies for a low amount of flesh, even if there is a stand in their own country and if there is a job, there is like a rag that has been paid by understanding and rich.

Let's taste and keep on their acts that are senseless, so that somehow you forget their rights so that justice can be broken and no one can make a sound and just keep quiet.

We are always looking for each other and we are looking for the reason of greedy and greedy; that the people who are struggling to lose hope in order to lose hope for the youth, but more unclear on the streets and make him completely.

If no one will take action, who will take action, and why are they hoping that, when there is no hope, if there is no hope, if they will let the aiman and robbery in the country's funds.

But to protest and fight, and end the damaged properties in our society!

No one will happen anything, if he is looking at and just complained.
