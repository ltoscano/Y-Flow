There is no clear talk about the house helper.

Last August 19, 1993, October 143 of Presidential Dec.Number 442) needs to pay house helpers to the SSS which is their house helper if they are being paid for 1,000 pesos every month.
If a maid who has a house helper who has been serving them for a long time will be counted by the SSS if they have not paid their maid for a few years.
There are a lot of employers because according to them it is very heavy! It is a burden for them, that is why in the end, the SSS does not think of it, because many thought the SSS is doing this law.
Because of the huge amount that they will pay in SSS, interest and publishing, one of a relationship with the house helpers is to prevent them from their employers so that they can avoid the huge expenses in exchange of Retiro Street.
At this point, SSS President and CEO De Quiros Jr., are the ones who got up.
The problem is not from them, they are only implementing the order from the authorities like DOLE who is the source of the law of RA-4855 for the house helper last August 19, 1993.
According to President De Quiros, what if they are already known or near 60 or 65 and this 2013 will only start, how will their benefits start, while they almost have grown old as their maid?
It will be given clarity on the misunderstanding about the Kasamhouse Law if the DOLE and SSS will be invited to sit and face the problems in this and to prevent any situation that will be worried about the events.
