"Oplan malignant creatures" and VK are everywhere in Cainta.

If it is true or not imagined by Vice President Jojo Binay's "Oplan malignant creatures" it is obvious that a Noguides of the issue of corruption and his family is true.
Just like what we are saying, that although we are saying that it is true that your servant is really busy with transactions in Makati, but we are not in favor with the timing in the investigation done by the Senate against the Binay family.
Because we are not sure if this is going somewhere after the election in 2016. In short, we can see that election is the only reason why it is being twisted.
Because if its credibility arrives, surely there will be people who will benefit from Mar Roxas!
However, nothing can be done to Nogued, I mean, Binay was unable to jump out, the cat from a basket! There is already there, and it cannot be denied by the attack of the Palace or the lawmakers who are investigating it.
If Binay really wants to save his dream of becoming a president, it is just right for him to face the Senate and present the documents that will prove that he is not malignant creatures!
What Binay is doing now is to appeal to the people that because they should not believe the issue that he is a thief.
That because he's being maligned because of the upcoming election, that because the investigation of the Senate is just due to Oplan Noguera or malignant creatures.
Mister Venancio, I mean, Binay, in what you are doing, it is as if you are saying that you believe that you are rotten or poor, we should just believe that you are saying that you are clean.
If you are clean, why do you not want to face the investigation of the Senate? Maybe it is true that you already had an illness, right?
Craving or ehek!
