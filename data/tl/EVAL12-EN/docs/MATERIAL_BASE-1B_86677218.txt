The PERA for DAP and 100 applicants have been wasted.

It seems that the officials in the government of President Benigno Aquino III are not fighting for the call of the irregularities in the use of pork barrel and even replaced by the fund of the Disbursement Acceleration Program or DAP.
Many Filipino people are calling out that they go down from position after getting out of the pork barrel scam, Janet Lim-Napoles, but it seems that there is no remaining dignity and refined in their bodies.
It is not just the law of people, especially by the lawmakers but also the lawmakers of God, many of them are seen to go to church, together with their families, but their conscience is very dirty.
Instead of the welfare of the people that they are going to serve, they put their own pocket and remove the DAP from the lawmakers and put it in a office where transparency should prevail in the implementation of the projects.
Um!
On Tuesday, around 100 days of service, Manila Mayor Joseph Ejercito Estrada said that there are many changes being implemented by the partnership of Estrada and Vice Mayor Francisco "Isko Moreno" Dooley, who will be ready for the benefit of the Manile√±os.
It is true that not everyone is happy with the changes being implemented by the two officials of Manila, especially those affected by their livelihood, but the changes being implemented are in legal way and aims to benefit from the majority.
Estrada and Moreno are lined up in programs for the benefit of the people they are serving.
They did not get the funds from the funds of the country because when they took office, the government of Manila is going to have a debt of debt.
They are working on the two officials who are applying at Manila to have a job for many of those from here, they are making a way to give them a proper and legal life.
