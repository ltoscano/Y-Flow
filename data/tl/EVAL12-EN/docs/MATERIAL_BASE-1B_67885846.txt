In Toda, there is a need to look into the LTO.

Why is it that the Land Transportation Office (LTO) seems to have no care for the tricycle and drivers who are driving and not only in Metro Manila but also in other parts of the country.
Maybe the LTO does not pay attention to the tricycle because they will not profit from them not just like the big vehicles especially those who are carrying or fired a van.
In the consecutive accidents involving the tricycle and motorcycles, most of them have no license, and if they have, these are students who have permits.
Yes, and there are local officials who violate the tricycle drivers but shouldn't LTO still need to check on its drivers if they have license?
Let us not go away, just here in Metro Manila where thousands of tricycle drivers are traveling, but this is not the monitor of the said agency.
I know that the people of LTO know this but they are blind and just pretending not to see it.
And every time a tricycle is an accident, its passengers are becoming pitiful because aside from the driver's driver, the motor is not registered which is why it is natural for its insurance.
Attach√© and Atty. Alfonso, Jr. LTO (Charisine, sir, you may have to check on your personnel "the license of the tricycle drivers" when there is time in Metro Manila.
In the inauguration of lily's Calvento Files, the tricycle drivers are not neglect the campaign of the local police related to the departure of tricycle drivers to drive without license because the reason of the drivers, they will only be next.
Lily's Calvento File are hoping that LTO will immediately take action to Atty. Alfonso, Jr. who in my acquaintance is an action.
