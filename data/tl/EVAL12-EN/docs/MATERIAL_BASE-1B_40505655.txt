Economic growth, okay the palace.

Let us give way to the reaction of a Filipino in relation to the increasing and growing economy of the country.
Let us read the reaction of many people who are proud of the Aquino administration that the economy of the country has been proud that the economy of the country has been tainted with PNoy, for PNoy, to those from Malacanang and for the giant capitalists, and rich.
We Filipinos living in the provinces, municipality and barangay have no effect if we are not included in their said economic growth, instead, we are having a hard work in other countries and because we are in number of low wages, the quality of life of the Filipinos are increasing.
That's why we call for Pres. Aquino and Malaca√±ang to be able to go out and is very handsome for the end of the word that the economy has grown up!
You are shameful!
