This day will be known if it will be money or a rock that will finally give additional pension for retired members of the Social Security System (SSS).
According to Bayan Muna Party-list Representative Neri Colmenares, it depends on the number of lawmakers that will be on this day which will be the last session of the 16th Congress.
"If the price of 192 will be placed on Monday (today), we will put under the election as a motion that will happen, based on the process of declaration of President Benigno" Noynoy "Aquino III in SSS, he needs to personally vote for 2 / 3 members of the Congress or equivalent to 192).
Because of this, Colmenares asked his colleagues in Congress to enter their last session this day to pass the said motion and give a little relief for the retired members of SSS.
Until last Friday, up to 119-congressman signed the motion to break and believes that it will reach 192) if all the lawmakers are going to enter.
"That's also our request for everyone to signed and has not yet signed, but it would have been supported to him that he / she said that he / she was given a session in the SSS which was supposed to vote in the SSS from President Aquino," says Colmenares.
He said that it is time to give a little relief for the SSS and pensioners especially that they will increase their salary based on Executive Order (NPC) 203 of Aquino.
