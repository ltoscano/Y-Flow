What the Lord did for you.

One of the issues this election is the rise of the eyebrows of some religious personalities who are allegedly endorsing the candidates.
The state of the Church has the separation of the Church so many will not agree to it.
That's why the priests who are noisy in expressing their thoughts about the issues of the community and government are accused of politicking and often criticized.
But the view of Pastor was a different perspective in Lighthouse Bible Bapist Church in Tatalon, Quezon City.
The statement of Pastor Balos, he is said to be busy and will not be campaigning for election.
This is good for those who would be supported by Pastor Rico as well because of his good reputation.
The lawyer of Pastor Ammute is strong.
For him, those with good hearts should be active campaigning for the welfare and goodness of the majority.
He added that while we are preparing for the nothing until the life of the convenience of the heavens, we should work hard as good citizens to help fix the life in the world while we are still in land.
If we are not campaigning for all good, it seems that we just neglect the bad people and there is no clean reason for them to do what they want.
Lighthouse Bible Baptist Church celebrated their 120th anniversary so a special statement of Pastor Rico as a special statement.
A message and warning is that we need to forget that we should not forget and give importance to the swelling of the good thing given by God to all of us.
In any time, let us emphasize what God has done for each of us.
Thank and give tribute to the power of the Lord and do not hesitate to share all the grace that we receive.
The open heart of all our good thoughts and dreams is a way of acknowledging the beautiful things that God has done for all of us.
