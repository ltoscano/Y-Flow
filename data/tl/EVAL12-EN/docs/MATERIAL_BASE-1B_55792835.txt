Fight back in K-12.

The government is lonely in following what the America wants to implement in the Philippines the K-12 immune system.
The K-12-12-12-12-12-12-12-12-year-old public education is okay because this is part in America, Britain, Canada and Europe, this is not appropriate for the Philippines.
In Europe and America, the public schools from grade 12 are complete, facilities are complete, and sufficient facilities and table are complete.
But not from the K-12 in the Philippines, the teachers are lacking in debt, most of them are money from debt.
Roads are also not enough, usually are rotten and are still in danger when there is a sudden rain.
The Teaching Hospital is also not enough, who usually answer to the teacher who will experience hardship because of their salary small.
Oftentimes, they will also feel bad for their barbells as they will not talk about anything and light a light to their classrooms.
This is true in our whole country, especially in secluded places that cannot reach any kind of vehicle.
But our government, are still trying to implement the K-12 because this is the only answer to the negotiations to pass, whatever it means.
Because of the K-12 that is not appropriate for the Philippines, there will be more information from the school Youth, which is why their parents will no longer learn to study them because of the loved ones that they want to send them to school.
And the lack of teachers and schools will worsen and our students would be more aggressive and the poor will be more aggressive.
Maybe even those who are rich would be rich, and other sharp objects in the Department of Education (DepEd) that are also famous in the field of graft corruption.
