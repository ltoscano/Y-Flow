From a unique city to progress, Makati and became the vice National Capital of the Philippines, "said that Binay was given free education by the youth, right or not, if it is not true, why is it not true why he does not want to answer?

In the midst of my work, I cannot help to write to it because Mayor Junjun Binay and his other siblings, Vice President Jejomar Binay, also did not want to leave each other in spite of the demolition of an operation against the police.

It was just an illusion that the burial of the law that was held by the law of the law? Is for the right side of live by live in a movie by Al Capone but it was good that there was no shooting.

Why do they not follow the law?

This is the only reason why they are being harassed by this, he can answer the allegations on him and face him and if they really do not have any fault, they will come out and instead of face the allegations of politicking, grand subdivisions and different gimmicks.

This is the attitude of Senator Nancy Binay... there is no one.

Not only because they do not seem to be coercion like Roxas Boulevard, that's how they treat them.

Who really is giving the order to them so that people will have a hard time here in Makati? Who is the head of DILG?

Here is the statement of Mayor?

We Are the financial center, we can show many things that we have done here, we are not negligent.

We are now here in a situation where our work will be difficult for you.

If VP Binay is going to run in 2016 and will win a big question to our corrupt Filipino, how can we buy Nancy Binay in his position if he does not have a strong vice mayor, why does Binay still remain in position?

Politics in our country is politics of convenience. If a politician is helped by a politician, you have a debt of gratitude for them and even if they steal in position, it seems that many are blind, and deaf.

"What can you say?
