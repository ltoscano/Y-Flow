The last piece of crystal.

Ginger Thy Walis name of Father Edwards B. Liwag.

Today is the feast of the owner of Jesus Christ, this is the last week during the common time of the New Year in liturgy by our church that was first week during the time of Adora.
The Lord God is investigating us that he will sit in the world.
Jesus Christ said to His men, "the son of the man as the King, together with all of the angels and will sit in His integrity," he got tired and visited by Jesus Christ, "he was used by the angels who have been used to us by the Father," he was used by the angel when he released the world. "
And for those who did not follow the holy commandments of the Lord, because we were able to ask help from my fellow citizen before the end of our life comes and let us know what is right now and let us see the Lord tomorrow and tomorrow it is open to one yesterday!
Let us all be together with the christians and celebrate our only peace in the coming celebration of Jesus Christ, King of the world, Chrismas, Cambot who will be the cause of Et Chrismas.
