Alden has a noodle house with Alden, not Maine!
March 21, 2016.
The Pambansang Bae, Alden Richards was once again defeated by her last concert in Ynarez gym last Friday night, in spite of almost up to 5x-Tropas that he is considered as one of the biggest artists in the country.
Alden may have grown up with the number of people who came to her only concert and in a far place of Antipolo, it was too happy with what his fans showed him.
"I do not think that you are going to be like this, but I have not yet seen each other, and I have not seen all of a big concert," we said, that's why, he just needs more time to take care of it.
We can say that there is a lot of Ynarez gym were filled with each other, which is why they are not listening to the side of Stage 3 which is really not listening to the people.
On the other hand, it is obvious that Maine Mendoza came out of the social media who allegedly arrived in the said concert of Alden, "that was the only thing she did not show up and just watched it near Verde, which is why they called Silent supporters and mystery lady.
But it is wrong that this is spreading in social media because Maine is not in the said concert, and we also know that Maine had a shot by one of his rival-time-law, which is why according to VTR, she only showed it.
Alden will leave and in Canada for her concert this Holy Week and Easter Sunday is his return.
