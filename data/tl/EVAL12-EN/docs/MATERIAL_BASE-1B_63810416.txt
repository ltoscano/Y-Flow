Miriam for President.

It is obvious that Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago was already going around, this is what our countrymen noticed because when he was seated in different parts of the country, the public immediately knows it because he is with the media.
Many are asking if Aling Miriam is going to run again as President of the country because it is noticeable, according to them, he needs attention and making noise to the issues of the country at present.
It seems that all the incident will be done to his fellow politicians, even in the Senate and Malacanang, because most of the friends of Aling Miriam are afraid that if it does not stop his mouth, it is likely that you will get back to it and be the one to get along with the accomplices of your biological friends.
Miriam Defensor-Santiago also said that it is time for a woman to handle the country, so everyone might have a reminder to say that he is interested in 2016 presidential election.
The question now is if the country is taking advantage of his promises to be spoken, or just let it be listened to by Miriam?
Many are also asking if the public has strong charisma on the public because he has long been in politics in the state, especially that everyone knows that he is the victim of Tabora.
The mystery should be answered by Juan Ponce Enrile because it is certain that what he will do is the issue of pork barrel scam that the public was really bitten by the public, even if it is on the direct attack of Miriam or by the pick up, it is really popular with the masses.
But we are sure that in 2016, whether Miriam is included or not Miriam, he will make noise that we cannot forget.
