Those involved in DAP.

On the SONA or the State of the Nation Address, President Noynoy went to the Batasang Pambansa. In Tondo, later on the SONA, people suspected to be criminals.
In Batasan, there are also a lot of criminals, those who stole the range of pesos, but they are not locked up because they are the ones being guilty.
In Tondo and all kinds of areas, the victims of the SONA are the one guilty in the SONA.
Butch Abad, the most guilty, according to the President, also the ones close to Noynoy, all of them.
It is unlucky for you to know if Noynoy is not an ally of Noynoy in Crame.
But the suspects are still lucky, like Juan Ponce Enrile, Jinggoy Estrada, Bong Revilla, Gigi, and Janet Napoles, they are not in the city jail due to a little complaint of the accused, they are an ambulance of them and free.
In Tondo, the accused are crammed in the dirty and hot cell in the pork barrel scam, they have a hospital for a pillow and air conditioner.
In the SONA in Batasan, on Monday, what could I share of Noynoy?
Few are the criminals who are from the government that are just the criminals.
Because the International Criminal Court does not have sex anymore, the officials of the Senate, Chamber and executive branch are already stolen.
There are only a few who are hungry and perhaps many of them might die.
The economy is grown, the economy of corrupt and not the economy of the people.
What will he say in the SONA?
He will no longer say that Nora Aunor is arrested for killing drugs.
Because it is lies.
He will no longer threaten the Supreme Court because he is hoping that the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) will be held again, which according to the Supreme Court is illegal, EP / Raul Valino.
