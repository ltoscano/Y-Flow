Many.

By Tomas, Santos-November 21, 2014.

The small boat will not be completed.
The weight of the feelings is left.
Without permission, understand and forgiveness.
They do not prepare.
The soul on patrol is a soul.
In grieving and moving.
By those.
You cannot control the brimming.
Whatever you get away from the body.
To be free, return.
And went down from the boat.
But the person in the back does not care.
Who continues to run over.
At the pond.
By those who are there in the glory.
