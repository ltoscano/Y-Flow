I do not know who is the owner of Vice-President Jojo Binay to put a contest on his relief goods for those who are damaged by typhoon Yolanda but that is really wrong, he became famous in the whole world because of being annoying politicians.
But it seems that Binay can be compared to Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte who is also one of those aspiring to become president in 2016.
If Duterte really has a good mayor, it is impossible that Davao has been going to go far from a major city in Mindanao but for a very long time, he still has not seen any change in the city.
It is easier to progress in the towns like Tagum if you compare it to Davao City, which is the biggest city in the entire Philippines, which is one of the poorest cities in Metro Manila, but this is also the richest in the entire country.
In truth, there are only many of our countrymen who are amazed by Duterte because they say, the country needs a brave leader.
Duterte is only good to make a gimmick and many of our countrymen are going to be cooked.
Do you not know that most of those who are killed in Davao City are not the criminals but critics and enemies in politics of Duterte, until now, there is still no justice for the murder of my friend the brooks who is Fernando "Batal" Linmei.
And to those impressed by Duterte, do you try to go outside the First District and go to the secluded corners of Davao City, you can see our fellow countrymen who have a bad luck because of excessive poverty in their lives.
You can also find out that even if Davao is a huge community in Davao, a lot of community are controlled by the communists New People's Army and this is a strong indication that a community is neglected, which is why the armed bandits were neglected.
"That is the reason why I feel pity that Duterte can be compared to Binay because if the issue is in service, there is no one from Davao City in Makati City.
