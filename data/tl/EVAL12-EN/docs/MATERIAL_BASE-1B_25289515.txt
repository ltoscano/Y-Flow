Martial Law in Sulu led by PNoy By Boyet Jumuad, June 16, the 20161.
President Benigno Aquino III considers the declaration of Martial Law in Sulu to catch the members of the Abu Sayyaf three weeks ago, but he did not continue in fear that the opponent of the government will increase.
In an entrapment interview in Jolo, Sulu, what President Aquino did was to make sure that he will consider the implementation of Martial Law in the province of Sulu.
PNoy explained why he did not allow the Martial Law in Sulu, "a lot of forces that will be used to be used by Martial Law in Sulu, but there might be an additional sympathy for the enemies," President Aquino explained.
President Aquino went to Jolo to personally know the date of the operation conducted against the Abu Sayyaf after the Canadian named Robert Hall.
After the crash site, the President ordered that the military and police implemented their operation against ASG for success to save for the remaining hostages.
