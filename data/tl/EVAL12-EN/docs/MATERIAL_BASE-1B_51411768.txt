Bocals, Chinese Producer.

In the increasing fight of the Philippines against China about the Panatag Shoal and some parts of the Spratly Island, it appears that our country is in danger of its goal of experiencing the said place which is known as "Bajo de Masinloc" during the time.

A defense of China is the understanding of 1947 in the time of Yuan Burleson, one astronomy, and that caused their defense, based on what they believe in the areas inside the South China Sea.

Meanwhile, the Philippines, the map of 1734, which proves the game of the Panatag Shoal which is made by the Philippines is one of the basis of the Philippines, which is the only way of our country in order to fix the said issue in the territory that is why China does not fulfill it.

That is why, every time there is an issue about the Panatag Shoal and the criticisms experienced by China in the Philippines, some of our countrymen cannot do anything but this is one of the words I've read every time there is an issue about the Panatag Shoal and Kalayaan Island which is said to be the territory of our country.

Some are saying that they will be able to donate modern weapons to strengthen our defense in the preparation if China continues to make a step on what is going to happen in the future, but our government are listening to our country?

If ever we avoid buying products made in China, how big is its effect on them?

In my opinion, all of the products in our surroundings are made from China, that is why, if there is a doubt that our country will weaken, it is sure that we will take advantage of the products made in China because it is sure that we will take advantage of the products made in China, perhaps it is difficult to fight China in the prices due to the machinery that they have made to do.

In the end, only the number of Filipinos and our leaders are needed in order to fight the actions of China against us now, are you only one of the dream to be faced?
