This was a mess.

These past few days, President Aquino was bombarded with criticisms due to the alleged failure of his government to bring help and fixing those who were devastated by typhoon Yolanda.
Chaotic and no system was made by the government to those affected, which is why there was even one who got hurt and robbery in some areas where Yolanda hit.
This observation might be the basis but it is not perfect for us to take the blame on the national government because for the immediate arrival of help for our poor countrymen in the Eastern and Western Visayas which passed by Yolanda.
Perhaps, any leader is really confident about this incident because of the consecutive calamities that visited our country.
Before Yolanda happened, thousands of our countrymen lost their homes and livelihood, and some were killed when he went wild at the MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari in Zamboanga City.
Just a few weeks have passed, Bohol and Cebu take a strong earthquake and the tragic fate of our countrymen there was tragic.
Even if we are not able to breathe easier from the tragic fate of our countrymen in Central Visayas, Yolanda hit the Eastern and some parts of Western Visayas.
Because of this, the construction of the government, which made it more hard for our countrymen in Leyte and Eastern Samar, can easily be taken off.
This is the reason why in this moment, I am not with the call for us not to be criticized by the government because of the number of calamities that broke our country within almost two months.
We need to support every action of our government that we need to support to fix his mission.
The people who just like to be good in one corner but do not do anything to improve the situation.
Even just this time we can help each other because while we take advantage of our strength to comment on the shortage of government, we should also use it to help our affected countrymen.
