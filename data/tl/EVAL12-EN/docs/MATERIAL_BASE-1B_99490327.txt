I do not want to fight back, he is ugly! By Aries (September 24, 2016.
"I do not want to fight back because he is ugly," this is the latest comments of President Rodrigo Duterte with Senator Leila de Lima.
In the gathering of the Police Regional Office 12 (PRO 12), Brgy. Tambler, General Santos City yesterday afternoon, President Duterte said that even before de Lima was mentioned by de Lima the leader of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR), this has no concrete case against him and all of them were made to malign him.
"De Lima, chairman of the Human Rights, Senator, did not tell me anymore, I did not expect that," I did not expect that, "I did not expect that," I did not think that, "I did not think that," I did not think that, "I did not say that," I told them, "I said," said Duterte.
He supposedly started beating de Lima due to politics.
"Fight IT in politics, all those who are dying there are those who were hit by her pictures of (ex-House Speaker Proseso) Nograles in the same time with de Lima that they are both ugly," he added.
