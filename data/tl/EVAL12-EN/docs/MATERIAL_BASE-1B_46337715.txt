Senator-cum!
Baba Perez July 17, 2016 although Senator Manny Pacquiao denied the statement of Top Rank Promotions, Bob Arum that he will go back in boxing, no one believes in boxing.
He is evaded, the mind of a boxing fans is already in good condition and the only thing that he is going to fight will be his fight in the upcoming fight and when this will happen.
Although Pacquiao said that it is not true that he will leave a boxing fight again, his sign that he will finish his retirement, if he will go back to boxing, he will make sure that he will not be busy with his work in the senate.
In the interview of Arum of the The Guardian, he said that Pacquiao has a blessing to look for a case and he will run against.
On the first release of Arum that on the date of October 15, it was reported that the Senator-cum-boxer could have brought it on Oct. 29 or November. 5 that is the new date.
About the possible fight of Senator Pacquiao, many are lined up like Betnovate and Crawford, Danny Garcia, Kyrie Irving and Lamar Odom.
But if the previous statement of Arum will be the basis, it seems that Crawford will be able to talk about each other, instead of taking advantage of the person who will be picked up by Radzmi Janairo, next week at the MGM Grand.
Arum said, anyone can win the Crawford (Postanes and the primary candidates who are going to fight against Pacquiao.
Postanes is the favorite training of the Social Welfare and trainer Freddie Roach if it is now as Freddie Roach.

But Roach admitted that if it happens, Postigo also wants Pacquiao to lessen it, his loyalty will be in the senator.
Pacquiao and Roach are together for 15 years and their father and son are together with each other.
