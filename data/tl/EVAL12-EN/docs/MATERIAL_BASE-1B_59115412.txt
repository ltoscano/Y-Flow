The Senate has the same for the people.

The management of the Senate is calling the people to help them monitor the national budget for the year 2015.
Senate President Franklin Drilon said, they do not want to close the Priority Development Assistance Fund or just like the funds declared by the Supreme Court.
After all, Drilon is right.
But, as a mother, does it mean that they cannot monitor Malacanang and their themselves in making any kind of PDAF for the national budget?
One more thing, almost all the lawmakers are united in saying that the only meddling of the lawmakers on the purpose of the projects that they are implementing in the national budget will be implemented.
The Palace has a call to the lawmakers to file a project that will be included in the proposed budget for the 2015.
It means, the lawmakers are going to give a project just like before, along with the thinking of Malaca√±ang in the projects and all of these will be given funds.
The point now is that the legislators of the projects can still earn or will earn money?
It's because before, they will insist on 20 percent of funds and 100 percent of their Ghost project.
Do you still have such human rights to the money money?
In the trend now that only prohibited is the meddling in the implementation of projects or programs that have a fund, who will say that the senators, congressmen, and from the Palace who are from the approval of the funds?
It will be said that corruption and corruption are quiet now, and if there is something coming out, only those in opposition will be hit.
The SC said, the orders of PDAF should return all the PDAF that they received.
Is there a lawmaker believed that he did it from PNoy that he also had PDAF last congressman and he was still a senator until all of the rules before the court had a hole on PDAF?
