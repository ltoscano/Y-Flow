Earn a "order to be held accountable.

President Benigno Simeon Aquino III ordered Secretary Leila de Lima to pay attention to the case of the kidnapped, Jonas Burgos, what's the outcome of the action made by de Lima when he remains active in the military and are still being swept in the position?
B. S. Aquino laid down the order after the Philippine Army and an official identified by Court of Appeals died from a mall in Metro Manila, coming out from a mall in Metro Manila, coming out from a mall in Metro Manila.
The style here in our country has been like this for a long time, which is only one of many kidnapped and killed by the military and police because of being activists.
In the belief of the institution military and police, they can do whatever it is because they are protected by the state and what happened to Jonas is proof of the widespread awareness in their ranks.
Just think that this is a very young official of the armed forces who graduated from the Philippine Military Academy at what the court said that this is a big role in the disappearance of Burgos and this is the reason why he learned the violence, the people fighting for their rights?
Jonas was a victim of fear and cowardice for the people who kidnapped him that's why they did not break the stand of the young man so they went into violence during their argument.
This is a clear proof of the weakness of their famous belief that they took advantage of the snatchers, which is why they took advantage of his non-fight and this is the reason why until now, he did not admit that he was behind his fall.

When will the administration of B. S. Aquino "be evacuated from our countrymen in South Korea, when the shooting has started to evacuate our countrymen in order to maintain the ports and airports in Seoul, it is certain that this administration will be saved from the coast and airports in Seoul, it is certain that this administration will be saved from the coast and airports in our country.
