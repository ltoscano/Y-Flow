Edious: A high hope for Duterte.
June 17, 2016.
The voters of President-elect Rodrigo Duterte has a high hope in the coming administration.
Even though he is not yet seated on the seat, a lot has already reached and he is celebrating all sorts of things.
From low salary, medical benefits, the additional pension increase in Metro Manila is still hoping to be promised for the traffic in Metro Manila, especially the millions of benefits of the government, especially those who have been visited by the Aquino administration, especially those who have been visited in Metro Manila, it is clear that more than 16 million people have been visited by more than 16 million pesos in their lives.
Some are not contented, not contented or not contented with PNoy, there are those who have been affected by the left crime especially in illegal drugs and there are also those who really want to make others better.
As well as well, they are just right to send a class for the service we want from the government because it is their obligation in the part of the government.
But the funny thing really is that the government will still depend on the government even the discipline.
Discipline should be in oneself and it is not a responsibility to anyone by his fellow countrymen who are being made into trouble and are just being done and the living room of each one is being done.
If even the discipline will be provided by Filipinos in the government, a big good luck "maybe the new administration will need it!
