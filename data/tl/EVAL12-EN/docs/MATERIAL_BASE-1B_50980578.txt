Should not be.

We believe that there is truth to the millions of millions owned by the Binay family in different parts of the Philippines.
"That is because Vice President Jojo Binay doesn't want to explain to the people about how much their loot, I mean, what really happened about the allegation.
And if the pigs are really true that the Senate Blue Ribbon sub-committee will not stop, only one means.
Even though many Filipinos know that the said investigation has a trace of politics, because Binay is silent, it will end here that the dream of Noguavas to be the first president of the country will end!
What's worse, is that he will be facing several complaints!
But if ever, the race in politics of Noguera will not be destroyed, maybe the Filipino people, SILG Mar Roxas, is not the alternative that Binay will make in the 2016 elections.
Let us not talk about it, make sure that its ratings in other Presidential survey will never be discussed.
Would we just let the issue on his left politicking as well as the victims of Yolanda who were neglected because he could not bring his own political interest.
In other words, for the sake of personal interests, Roxas is prepared to have closed his eyes while his countrymen are very down.
A good attitude, make sure that it is too dangerous for a president!
That is why we strongly believe that if Binay is not right for the highest position in our country, it is not right for the highest position in our country because it is not enough to steal from the treasury of the country.
It is good that Duterte is just!
