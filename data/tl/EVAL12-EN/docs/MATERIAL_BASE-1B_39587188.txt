According to him, June 10, 2016.
Many are criticizing the K-12 program in our government but I think it is good for us to give it first to the entire Asia that is why it is not surprising that it is easy for us to leave our neighboring towns like Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia.

Filipinos are great and intelligent, they should be given every quality of education and that is the purpose of the K-12 program in our government.
This school year, maybe some of us are hesitating to finish our children a good future, but if we still want to finish our children's power, we should not be working hard for our children's education, we should not have a hindrance in giving up to our children's dreams.
