The memory of Ninoy was full of memory.
(Pilipino Star Ngayon), PO2 44; UPP-August 21, 2014 - 12: 00am.

The murder of Senator Ninoy Aquino on August 21, 2009 was the start of the changes in the country that was torn apart from the minds of Ninoy Aquino, the death of Ninoy Aquino, the death of Ninoy Aquino, the death of Ninoy Aquino, which caused the death of Ninoy to be united because of the death of Ninoy.
Thirty-one year has passed since he was shot at the Manila International Airport (currently Ninoy Aquino International Airport (now, the soldiers who were involved in Ninoy Aquino International Airport) did not know that he did not know who was involved in Ninoy Aquino International Airport, but in their minds, they have no idea of who was involved.
Ninoy will not forget about the sacrifice of his life to bring down the minds of his name and he will not forget his name and even President Cory, he was against the passport extension.
What is surprising, it seems that their son, PNoy, is firm to have a charter change in order for extension of the term when his resolve has changed and he seems to be listened to.
He should not forget the inheritance of Ninoy.
