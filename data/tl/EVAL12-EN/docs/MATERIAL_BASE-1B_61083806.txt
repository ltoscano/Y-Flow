Binay was placed inside a different identity, a lot.

It seems that the result of Vice President Jejomar Binay's statement about her plan to run as President in 2016 is not good and the continuous strengthening of the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA).
Since he expressed his plan, some groups started to act to destroy him and destroy his relationship with President Noynoy.
The last year of being attacked was revealed in the news that Rappler said, where he learned the identity, which he sent to President Noynoy last January 3, 2011.
A lot is related to the case of former military Comptroller Carlos Garcia where they are making it look like in the report of website that he is fixing the case and the former general.
Binay was also laid down because he did not clarified on the report of Rappler that he was just advised by President Noynoy to not force the plunder case against Garcia and instead he will be charged with other cases in order to be sure of his name.
Binay is ill-tempered because he knew there is no other strategy for the separation but also inside the palace.
He's a bit scared now because they know that he is still having a lot of snack or the identity he sent to Malaca√±ang, which can also be used and given to others to destroy him in the eyes of the public.
For me, it is too early his plan for politics is the biggest mistake by Binay.
Maybe he should exchange some of his political adviser because they have not seen the negative effect of the early meaning of his plan.
What is painful is Garcia is having a taste, or a lesson because based on the point or what I have received, there are a lot of becoming more cruel, or those who will be released so that it will fall and be completely destroyed by President Noynoy.
So as early as now, he should be prepared to take care of their lives and the enemies are also being attacked.
