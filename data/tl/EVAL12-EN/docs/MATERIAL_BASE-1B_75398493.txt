Since Vice President Jejomar Binay seemed to say that he will run for a higher position in the 2016 elections, the former vice mayor of Makati City said that he / she said that Binay's name was coming back to the accusation of former Vice Mayor Ernesto Mercado, all the VP Binay said that he was just being dragged by the vice mayor of Makati City.
It is being accused by VP Binay because of the severe Makati parking building that was used when he was still the mayor, the amount of the parking building is about 1.3 billion pesos, according to Binay, he received a vacation from the building, he admitted that he also benefited from it.
VP Binay said, the senators are using the Senate to comment on his name and family because they say that it is not the same case for him to run in 2016, that is why he says the accusations against Vice President in the Senate will say it to the next hearing but he refused the invitation.
We can't understand why the invitation should be rejected, if there is nothing wrong to refuse the accusations, this is a good chance to clarify the accusation and he should remember that the people are looking for it to show that he has no fault.
