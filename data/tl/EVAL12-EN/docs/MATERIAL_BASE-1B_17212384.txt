Know your right and you have nothing to abuse.
SSeptember 8, 2016.
The government of Duterte does not have a limit or deadline until when will the state of the emergency will be implemented.
The declaration of the state of emergency will be taken back by President Rodrigo Duterte in the moment that the country is safe from the hands of the terrorists.
Along with this, the Palace appealed to Malaca√±ang that it would not be alarmed in the presence of the police and military in some main places in the country, this is part of the implementation of the state of emergency where there will be a checkpoint in the implementation of bad elements in society.
For us, the strengthening of security is not a problem because it is also our safety depends on this.
But for us, there is no abuse in power to do those who will implement the law or those who will conduct a checkpoint because it is clear in the release of the declared state of emergency in the proper implementation of the checkpoint.
We are worried because it is not unknown to our knowledge that many authorities are taking advantage of their power especially this kind of operation.
So aside from our call to the police and military in the proper implementation of the law, especially in the checkpoint, we call the people to know our rights on this opportunity so that it will not be abused.
