Mayor Joseph "Erap" Estrada made an alleged drug rehabilitation center at the Manila Boystown Complex in Marikina City the more than 400 drug pushers who surrendered to help their change.
Estrada stressed that the construction of the said facilities in 23-hectare of the Boystown Complex owned and run by the city government of Manila is started.
"We should just help," the drug pushers who want to change their lives, especially those who have no ability to help, "said the illegal drug industry," as long as we do not allow the illegal drug industry to help, "said that the illegal drug industry is still here," he added.
It was determined that the drug pushers and killed pushers already surrendered to the Manila Police District (MPD) this past week.
