Be ready.

Be ready (Less. 12: 35-38) two women were going home to Occidental Mindoro after they bought a ticket to Batangas pier.

They got out of the ship while they looked around.

They will fall asleep in life and that is also what is happening when it is not ready.

It will be approved by the path that's why in the situation that's coming, that is why it's a good reminder to the Lord Jesus to be ready for the arrival of the Lord.

During the time of Jesus, there are people who are waiting for the arrival of someone who is getting married for a long time, and also because of the long time that they are waiting for, we should always be ready for what they are waiting for now and not be ready for the return of the Lord.
