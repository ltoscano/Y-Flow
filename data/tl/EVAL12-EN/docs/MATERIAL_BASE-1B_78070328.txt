Pacquiao will fight again.
By Al G. Mendoza July 15, 2016.
Of course, Manny Pacquiao will fight again.
But for the two reasons.
First, in the right payment, second, if the body has a sound of body.
It cannot be denied that Pacquiao's income is almost in billions.
That is why billions of tax will be given to him by the BIR (bureau of Rentanglement).
Even Pacquiao will be questioned, even if that is the venom on him, the additional amount of additional money is still strong.
The person is lazy, with no covetous, if there is a laboratory that can be built, it also has money to attract.
When Bob Arum said, he / Pacquiao said, that Pacquiao has a fight on October, of course, Pacman could deny it because he's not in our side.
But in boxing, which is like that.

Arum will have a long time and who will question the power of Arum when it comes to boxing?
Pacquiao has been retired and he reiterated that he is focused in the Senate hearing but because October is the scheduled fight of Arum, Pacquiao has a August-September.
And when Pacquiao agrees with the challenge of Arum, she is sure that she will go back to it and besides that he will earn again.
She proved that in his last fight and he defeated Tim Bradley.
Whoever opposed in case Pacquiao will fight again, he will surely have criticisms.
Of course, in Pacquiao's yes, the consulate of the boxer prevailed again.
