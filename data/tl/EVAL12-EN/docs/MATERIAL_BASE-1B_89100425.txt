Unity and helping.
Bailagutan, October 21, 2016, it is hard to find a good benefit from the calamity happening in our country.
But only two of my thoughts, first are the calamities that this serves as a point to unite and help each other.
Second, in spite of this calamity, we can see hope like the inspiration because of your inspiration and light, after the dark, the cold of us will live again, will rise again and overcome the challenge.
That's why the preparation of all sectors, whether public or private, is very commendable.
A few days before the typhoon Karen arrived, it was followed by the super typhoon Lawin, that those that are going to save for the agencies of the government are now ready.
In fact, even if President Rodrigo Duterte is not in the country, it is in the four days of state visit in China, focused on the events in our country especially in areas affected by typhoon Lawin.
Meanwhile, some residents in the places which are directly hit by the super typhoon are Kurdi and forced to evacuate going to the evacuation centers to save their lives.
Most of all at this point, we want to dismiss the actual case of PAGASA in the way that the storm will pass through in the path of typhoon and the wind you possess.
Let us also include the media, who will give us a date on the middle of the danger that their constituents will face to serve as guidance for all the threats of the storm.
That is why in the midst of the damage caused by the record of the storm, what is important is this point that it has created it to unite and help each other, now that we will be part of the system of every Filipino people.
