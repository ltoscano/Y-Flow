She is very fond of sex, Kuya Rom November 16, 2016 with Kuya Rom.
My problem is 23, me 22, I felt bad for him when he got into an accident before and had been broken by two years on a wheelchair.
But it seems like I want to stay away from him, because I see our relationship with him being flirty with other women and sex, he promised to stop him, but it is difficult to accept, but it is hard to accept, but what I am doing is getting worse.
He said, you are the other people who are going to show up, because it seems that what I want to do is like what I wanted to do, it seems that she is very fond of having sex with another woman, so I should try to be happy.
So many changed her.
I pity him.
Dear Hala,
You are a good person, has love for others, he has courage to do something that will help you with your personality, but because of your beauty, you have a concern and helpful.
He has been abused by your love for a long time, because according to your story, she was flirty with different people and she is happy.
Maybe she became the flawless, because in the past experience, you are still young, you are still playing with sex, she has sex with an sex.
But it is not right to make the past make a reason to live in indecency.
He is challenging you to prove that you still love him, because he wants you to stay with him for four years when he is playing with your heart and body.
Is this the kind of man you want to be with while life? Is this the person you want to be the father of your children?
For this man, you have done something good, but he does not give importance to what he is doing to take advantage of your goodness.
You have the courage to do what is right and use this courage to improve your life.
You are still young. Someone just passed away from God and pray that he will give you a chance to find a man who is faithful to you.
