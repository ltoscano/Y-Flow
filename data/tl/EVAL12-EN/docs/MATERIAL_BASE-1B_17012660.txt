Useless!

.

The management of the Social Security System should not only be investigated by the issue of millions of bonus that was given by the officials for themselves.
Naturally, it is natural that the faces of the officials of SSS are really weak.
The officials of Governor's Commission for GROs) (GCG), led by Atty. Cesar Villanueva must take care of it because instead of stopping the officials of the SSS which made up, they still defended them.
For those who are not familiar to GCG, this is formed when the Republic Act Number 10149) or the "GROs C chief of 2011" said that this will be the monitor and a "Ginger C-C) like the SSS, government financial help and being called Philippine National High School (GCEve).
There are so many GROs C, GFi and GCE, and most of us do not know what is doing and what is the reason why he is taking a pillow from those with no job and friend of whoever is seated in the administration, this is probably the reason why he was founded by RA 10149.
Well, if it is not so much stupidity of GCG is done by GCG, it is not really obvious that GCG and SSS do not seem to be touched only with the call of the officials of the SSS which can create millions of bonus to the contribution of the contribution of their members?
There are also people who really do not know how to be ashamed just like the officials of SSS from the leadership of SSS Chairman Juan B. Santos and SSS President and Chief Executive Director Emilio de Quiros, "this is the reason why RA 10149 and composed of GCG is supposed to be affected by the thick faced.
But if it turns out that GCG is worthless, it is better to just separate them by the people and employees, as well as the money spent by the people for their office.
Maybe people behind GCG would be more helpful if they will just be placed in Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) to increase the cleaning of our inlet canals.
