Hopefully, PNoy.

It is possible that not just watching television, President Benigno Aquino III is listening the newspaper and reading the events in the country, especially the killings of journalists, officials of the local government and police.
The focus of Pres. Aquino's attention is focused on the use of the politicians of the Liberal Party which is trying to speed up the "pork barrel scam, while they are trying to step down on the" pork barrel scam, while they are trying to avoid him, "the best" of robbery in the country's funds.
PNoy should not pay attention to the killing of the mayors and police because these are all who have the ability to make their bodies cut off and defend themselves.
But the journalists have their own life and cannot bring weapons, aside from the brain and plaza, we should first put and help President Noy.
But PNoy was not able to pay attention to the events in the town of Juan dela Cruz, especially the "media killings, wherein last Monday, Nilo Bacordo, the 129 journalists killed in the administration of Aquino.
When President Noynoy will not be resolved if President Noynoy will not start the movement in order to end the violence that the President and even by the Philippine National Police, if the Philippine National Police will not be given justice, he could not be given justice.
PNoy should not wait to add the number of stray journalists in his office so that President Noy will not regret on his continue to sleep on their noodle house and sell it in Malaca√±ang.
Because one day, he / she woke up that his / her rival guards did not have anything to run away and he could not be followed and even was a victim of violence which he did not give attention, especially in the case of journalists.
