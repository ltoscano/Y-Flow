The news about a mother and his six children who were able to be saved from the explosion of typhoon Yolanda, flood and rain which was caused by typhoon Yolanda, "but died from the fire in a Temporary Protection Program in Tacloban last May 28.
The public made this tragedy so that the progress of the turtle-Remontadoses have been made for thousands of supporters, this would be a month after the devastation of our dear President.

In a mandate of the signed contract recently by Mayor Susan Ang and to be able to pay up to 1 Council Chairperson Eve Ang, the Larang Tantos will also be set to have three rooms for the central elementary school of San Isidro.
The Lalaurie of 70 kilometers per hour (20 years old, which is used to be used by water film fest season) in the city, will also donate school to be used by 7,000 students in elementary and high school schools in the municipality.
This project is very commendable but I am hoping that in the case of our dear president, the LMB will fulfill his promise within a year, that is more than the government's own program.
