There is no place for this woman in society because of his shortcomings, but for the Jesus Christ, his will be healed.

The woman might just be a garbage but for Jesus, this is an important wealth, if there is a good wealth in this time, there is no one else but the people who prioritize the goodness of the family and home.

They have a lot of sacrifice for the improvement of the family of his loved one, that is why she was able to go home for 15 to 30 months but when he saw his salary, it was too long for him to have money and rest because he needs to earn money because he needs to earn money because he needs to earn money because he needs to earn money for the needs of his family.

What is true is that we should tell that this father is a bit good because there are fathers who are married, they are still not wondering why when a man is married, this is the reason why the father wanted what we desire for the children!

Jesus knows the will of each one that Jesus forgave the woman because it is true that she asks for forgiveness, and because if you want to be mad at her, it would be better for you to be ill-tempered so that he would not be ill-tempered so that it would not be ill-tempered so that it would not be ill.
