Who should clean this August 29, 2016 there is still a chance, according to the Palace of Malacanang, that the names of those involved in the trade of illegal drugs are clean, particularly the approved names of President Rodrigo Duterte.
Cleaning the names of those who are involved in the operation of illegal drugs may be, said Presidential Communications Office (NPC) Secretary Martin Andanar, to do the one being accused of the moment he faced the court.
All who were named will have a chance to clean their names in court and to the Philippine National Police (PNP), the PNP can also accept the affidavit of those involved in illegal drugs to clean their names before it reached the court.
We salute the strong campaign of the government on illegal drugs that we know for a long time.
The only thing that is not acceptable is the order to clean their departed name in court or in the PNP.
For us, it is not a simple mistake by a name in the world of illegal drugs.

This is a severe challenge and the destruction of good names or reputation.
So we believe that no one else can be irritated with the names of each being involved in illegal drugs but the government or the president of the country.
