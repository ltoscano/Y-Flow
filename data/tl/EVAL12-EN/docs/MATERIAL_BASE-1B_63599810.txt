Good luck to us.

Waiting for this day, there are already many speculations, the criticisms are early and it is still early to say that what President Noynoy Aquino will say is worthless.
The Nation Address now (SONA) has a state of the SONA) and no matter what some say, all of us are waiting for what the President will say.
We will wait for what will be related to our life by PNoy - about the economy, in order and peace, in work and in suppressing hunger and poverty, even about politics.
For me, it is important to mention the administration's plan about transportation.
We have already discussed many times what is related to the issue of transportation in the economy and poverty of the Filipinos, that is why many times we have released almost 3,000 passengers everyday going to their jobs and going home to their homes?
Even in the train, it is still different when they ride in other parts of Transportation and where they are late or not going to go back to their salary, because of the non-term of Transportation, the business is affected, the economy is affected, the economy is affected.
That's why in other countries, like Singapore and in our exclusive city of Bogard, the country Colombia, fixing the system of transportation is one of the highest priority of the government.
In the country like China, the transportation is being focused on because China is one of the highest number of population and this country also has its ambition to become the strongest economy of the world.
In PNoy's SONA, many are waiting for what he will say about the issue of transportation, especially this week, the number of Filipinos already declared a hundred million pesos.
We are increasing in number, that's why there are more who responded and the improvement of our economy will be bigger.
Good luck in all of us.
