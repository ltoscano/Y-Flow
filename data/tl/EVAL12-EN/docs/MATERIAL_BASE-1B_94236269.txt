Road.

Road (JO-14-14) focus on an example when you go to a place where you do not know where the road going to your destination is right, then you turn left at the next corner, then turn right back at the next corner, then turn right at each other, and you might have not followed the way he is pointing at.

But when you say that you are going to ask him: I will accompany you to your destination because he is sure that you will reach your destination because he is still not telling the path, but he is the one who made the way. "
