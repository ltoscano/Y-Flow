The Philippine government is a government official "in the US, Nunber," Ang, the case of murder of Colonel James Rowe.

Do you want to know how strong is the government of the Philippines in the United States?
It's a good example of this, of course, the case of murder of a Filipino transgender Jennifer Laude has a good example but a good example is the opposite of what happened: A American soldier was killed by a Filipino, here in the Philippines.
I am referring to the case of murder of the suspected members of Alex Boncayao Brigade (which was also part of the New People's Army or NPA) to Colonel James Nicholas "Nick" Rowe in 1989.
It is considered a war against the US Armed Forces, Colonel Rowe, he is a veteran in the Congress War, and five years that he was fighting in the hands of the military by the US in South Vietnam, he was one of the few American soldiers who were allegedly able to escape from the captives.
Rowe was assigned to the Philippines in 1987 when he stood up as the chief of Army Division and Deputy Commander of Joint Task Force (WestMinCom), while armed men were driven by a Filipino driver going to Camp Crame, 1989, at the corner of Tomas Morato and southern end of the car, but the driver was hit and also died.
Rowe was a big challenge for the murder of the US in the Philippines, aside from war Hero, Rowe was asked to be an expert in the counter-governmental organization operation of the US Armed Forces to avoid travelling their enemies.
The Philippine government was tortured by the AFP and police, and to the government of Corazon Aquino, to catch the police who killed Rowe last June 1989 when the police arrested the suspect in the murder of Rowe.

What is the difference in handling the government of the Aquino administration and II in the suspect, Iheight and Consortium (to the murder of Rowe) and US Marine Brigade Joseph Scott Pemberton (of the murder of Laude)?
We know where Pemberton is now in the custody of the US in Kaklase), meanwhile, she was said to have been spared from the hands of the authorities of the police but according to the two groups of human rights, he was said that she was also members of human rights to the Philippine National Collins.
According to the force of the two, he was able to pay for a lifetime imprisonment in court, Iheight and Consignation.
In spite of the appeal of various human rights to free the two, he was allegedly tortured by the government of Corazon Aquino, Fidel Ramos, Joseph Estrada and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo when he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, which is why he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the murder of Rowe, while he admitted that he was innocent in the killing
It is clear in the way that the government handling the case of Consortium and Iheight that is the government of the US, that is why the government of the Philippines was able to go against the rights of the Philippines, according to the Philippine People's Army, that is why the government of the Philippines was sent to him and was forcefully brought to jail.
Meanwhile, any American soldier stayed in jail in spite of the crimes that was being accused of them, Lance Corporal Daniel Smith, just a few days ago in Makati City Jail before escaping with the Philippine government and Department of Justice of the Philippines to the US Embassy in 2006.
There is another point that Laude has given an emphasis on the two cases of civilians, which is why he is not involved in the war against Mobiline last November 13, 1986, and his companions in the US Marines and Central Intelligence Agency) who were victimized by the Philippine National Disaster and Central Intelligence Agency) who were involved in the colonization of the US Marines and Central Intelligence Agency) in the Philippines that resulted in the colonization of the US in South Vietnam.
Then, until now, the tactics of AFP from the counter-Tropas that the relationship of the US and the Philippines can be focused on the help of the US and the Philippines so that the end of the US Armed Forces) in the field of economy and politics, of course, this is the relationship of the two countries.
That's why it's not surprising, and it is expected that the AFP and government government in following the United States will get in danger even if both Filipinos are in danger.
