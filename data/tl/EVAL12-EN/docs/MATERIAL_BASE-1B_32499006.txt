The future is beautiful and confused.

A truth that each of the students should remember, those who take care of their parents, for them to finish studies and have a good future.
"It is often said by parents," take care of your children, because we do not have any wealth to you, but education that we feel like to be given to you. "
But why is it that there are many youth deaf to this call of parents, many have no interest in studying, while some are studying.
Many want to study, but nobody is studying because of the hardship of life.
Education is the most important inheritance of a parent to her children, that is why the parents can support the education of their children, this should only be given importance by these youth.
The mind of children who have parents should be clear and they are ready to be brave because you have a parent who will bring you good education, that will bring you good education in the future.
Work hard in studying, you will further pursue you to finish your hard work, illness, patience of your parents for the gold that they have given to you which can't be stolen by you.
