PO 3 44- huge protest versus pork, was launched in Makati.

Again, the growing movement of the pork barrel continues to protest again, it was belittled by the Philippine National Police (the estimated number of 10,000 people that were released by President Aquino to be released by President Aquino, and will also go to Mendiola).
But the different groups and sectors already showed unity in the previous actions at the Luneta, EDSA Shrine and Mendiola - some of the well-ranking officials of the city and nearby provinces have tried to answer to all of the public funds in Makati City, and asserted the use of funds of the country for public service.
What's still different from the said gathering, it seems that the price of the administration has become more sharp but also brought by some sectors to answer to those who are involved in the Disbursement Acceleration Program or DAP, the Aquino administration), that if you did not bring change, the Aquino administration has not caused changes, and even if you have not caused change, it seems that you have not caused change.
The Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of March, and militant group of pork barrel scam promised that they will continue the protest - especially since the expected approval of the 2014 national budget of Congress and the palace is approaching.
