The favorite place to commit suicide by Filipinos.

Fun - to have fun, opinion - opinions.

It is only this noon when I have read the text message of one of my friends, "there are some of those who jumped from Shaw Boulevard," WTF! Some of them jumped from the MRT or LRT?

Where is the favorite place to commit suicide?

1 - LRT-MRT - it's because I don't know if someone already committed suicide in LRT 2 but I know that someone already committed suicide under the train because he was hit by other people who committed suicide, isn't it?

2 - a high building, especially to the businesses that jumped into Ortigas Center for high building and broken bones, they have not even thought of their bad appearance if they jump out of the same life, right?

3 - in Mall.

I am wondering why people are thinking about to commit suicide? Well, I thought that I am really thinking about it when my dog hanged herself, and then I will fail in love with a tree of tomatoes, that is why I won't be able to escape.

"My ex-worker said," you are a nuisance, even when you are still alive, you are still a nuisance when you die!

Well, maybe there are many who have been thinking about suicide because of the difficulty of life, many of those who commit suicide have become a problem with the family and love which is frequent because of the severe blood pressure in life, shame or whatever it means that I am also wrong to listen to it because this is a great cowardice!

Let us remember that even if life is difficult, it is good that no matter how much the bad things that we need to look at, we are really confused that we look at the good events, we will not think about suicide.

And for those who committed suicide, I am sorry for you, that you are able to pity you, but in reality, there are many who love you, which is why you have not noticed anything.
