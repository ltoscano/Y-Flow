Um!

Many are hoping that the Manila Police District director Chief Superintendent Rolando Nana has been able to stop the illegal gambling stopped by Manila Police District director Chief Superintendent Rolando Asuncion after leaving his position and accept Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada.
Oh no, you will die with anger, especially his ex-General who says Mayor Erap and introducing themselves as mayor of a office in Manila City Hall but he does not have any person except for the sergeant who is a child of former Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim.
The name of a police official was destroyed because his name was used to collect the sergeant when he was not receiving anything.
The resolve and principle of General Santos is strong and he is ready for not to accept the weekly payola from the gambling dens which is trying to join the gambling dens which is why he contacted Mr. Clean who said that he is strong in the DD of Manila.
But it's just that, GROs, Mr. Clean was denied that it was the one who wanted to sell gambling this week, the general said that he should not destroy the money that should have been made on the gambling place, but he would not destroy his services just to acquire money.
Even if he cannot remove from position his officials asked by a few councilor of Manila to be fired from his position, especially if he knows that you are working.
He does not do anything in his new position if you do not have a model, look into the vehicle he is using, even in red plate, a former mobile patrol car.
It will be more better if the usual generals will not agree to spread on drugs in Manila, which is usually focused on illegal gambling that is why it is clear that the operation of his District Special Action Force (ASG) is clearly hoping that the operation of Mr. CDO should be stopped, especially in the video karera of Gina Gutierrez.
