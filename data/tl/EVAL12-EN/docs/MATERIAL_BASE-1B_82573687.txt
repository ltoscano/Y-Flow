If it reached 18 percent of the survey of Mar Roxas, it can be considered that we can consider this boils from VP Jojo Binay.
This is the observation of political analyst from the country because almost all commissioners of PNoy in the next year are PNoy, and almost all of this is endorsed by Mister Mar, the wife of Korina Sanchez.
If it is true that Roxas is saying that Binay is endorsing the new leaders of the Comelec, it is possible that Binay is going to be nervous because it is not possible to put any malice to the involvement of Christian Lim, former president of PNoy and Roxas, Atty. Luie Tito Sotto, former president of the National Bureau of the Philippines and one of the lawyers for the impeachment of former Chief Justice Renato Corona and Al-Feno, former member of the LTFRB board.
In the next year of February, three more boss of the COMELEC is scheduled to retire and this are commissioners of Lucio Tagle, Elias Yusoph and Chairman Sixto Brillantes.
It is certain that Binay will do any malice and doubts about the seven members of the commission that will cover-up the 2016 elections which is all assigned by PNoy, supporters and candidacy of Roxas.
It is very clear that Roxas is getting closer to Binay because of the heated argument between Vice President and that is probably the actor-called actor now on why Roxas is improving the rating of game.
But they cannot hide from the malicious mind of the public to stop it because up to now, there is still no suspicion that it has been made a way for Mar to win the election until the result of election 2016.
This is how the camp of Binay is thinking about this because, if in the past, he agrees that he agrees to be a Noguera because he knows the ability of the new commissioners of the Comelec.
It is clearly seen from the actions of PNoy that it is caused by Binay and that is the lower part of a leader who is seated in position in order to do everything to win, Roxas (ALNAs Womb of Alvin Feliciano.
