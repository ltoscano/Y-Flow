Understand what is the palace.

It was noticeable that in the last few days and week, Malaca√±ang became the center of criticism on various issues and issues that the Supreme Court did not survive even if the Supreme Court did not survive even if the anger of the people stopped and the anger of the people stopped.
The administration is also reminding the continuous increase in the price of oil, as well as the plans of the petition to raise the petition for all of these issues, I can say that the people have no reason to stop and inform the government that the rich businessmen are doing not right.
It seems that the giant businessmen are playing with the lives of Filipinos, that in every move they need to earn, they need to sacrifice the welfare of the poor, but there are also some proposals that the Aquino government needs to pay attention and understanding.
And included here is the increase of contribution for the contribution of the Social Security System and Philippine Health Insurance Corporation so that the proposed bill will become controversial, but I think it is needed to add the social protection program of the government.
At first glance, the plan is not acceptable but if the basis will be the basis, it is certain that this will be beneficial for the government economic Planning because the government should not always let the government do.
When the militant protesters are all complaining because what we believe will happen to the good programs of the government, it's because they do not know any solution to the problems of the country.
