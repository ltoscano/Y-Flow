Flow and Liwag.

Many have changed in the appearance of politics in Caloocan after Vice Mayor Egay Erice was able to return as mayor of the city this coming May 2013 election.
Erice is requesting the desire of President Noynoy Aquino to run as a congressman on the second district of Caloocan.
And in his return to the graft case, the Liga President RJ Echiverri and Cong. Oca Malapitan presented.
To whom to RJ and Orca, who will support Egay, in the survey, seems to have taught Cong. Close to the first district.
In some crowd and prudent, there is no negative statement from Oscar, instead of sweet stories about him, the theme of the agreement was the opposite of the hurtful words against Crib. RJ that his father, Mayor Recom Echiverri, served as the three term as mayor of Caloocan.
I cannot take away from the previous administration of the city that after a long-year term, the mayor, Boy Asistio and Rey Malonzo, after serving three Tempo why is it like the residents of Caloocan.
It has been many times when former Mayor Asistio and Mayor Malonzo in their roof, but they did not succeed.
With the flow of events, if will the theme of the conversation between Caloocan and be prudent in the people of Caloocan, this is in favor of Malapitan. This is a sign that the unexpected fate of ex-Mayor Asistio and Mayor Malonzo.
Anyway, the election is far, there are many times that the former candidate is strong at first, but also a race lacking in the end, but also a race in the end.
Because, not only the mayor is at stake, but also the congressman of 1st district, who will fight Mayor Recom Echiverri and Calaguas.
