For those who have long been able to read what Joel Rocamora was the former president of Akbayan as the chief of the National Anti-Poverty. "That is why there's a lot of things noticeable from his defense against the Leflawless,"
Many were identified as Rocamora as an official of Akbayan as well as his friend Mon Casiple, while she was impressed by the secrets of the Black Nazarene, while he was asking the secrets of the Virgin Mary, "Fidel Ramos, whom he did in books,", "Fidel Ramos," said to be a sound in books, but before he was made in books, that was what he did in books.
Whatever it is, he is the chief of NAPC yesterday and close to Pres. Noynoy Aquino.
But the huge weakness of him, that is what the reform means by the reform, that is what Noynoy Aquino said that he will give way for President Noynoy Aquino to implement that he will not go forward if President Gloria Arroyo said that he will not be charged with President Arroyo - which is not being held accountable.
And the Pambansang Kamao does not want reform even if it is a hindrance to the fulfilment of their real change, that is why there is no other choice but the national government of Hacienda Luisita, not able to give comfort to the citizens, that's why the government is getting stronger, and the national governments of the government.
But Rocamora was not able to comment on this account, he just wanted to scare the public, to make sure to be responsible for the president of the citizens, that is why he was caught to be blamed by the president of the citizens, that's why he was able to blame the sentiments of the president of the citizens.
This is like the Imelegging "and" Marcovetous, "but it was invented while Aquino is president.
