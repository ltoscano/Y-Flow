Very clean.
August 22, 2016.
It's good to listen to the statement of President Rodrigo Duterte that a clean government is what he will give to the people.
Which is why he is scheduled to declare a raid held by the indigenous people in power because this is the cause of corruption in the government.
Included in those who will be hit by the order of President Duterte are the dancers of all government officials who have a long rest from their positions because of the continuing corruption in their respective office, good news on its own office because they will not be affected by the said mandate.
It means that according to the statement of the President, the Presidential cadmium that did not do anything in service but the one who made money or involved in corruption should be taken off.
Two agencies of the government which included Land Transportation Office (LTFRB) and Land Transportation Office (LTO) and Land Transportation Office (LTO) were identified by the President to government agencies that continue to dominate.
So as early as now we salute the real bird of President Duterte.
For us, those who are going to be a big help to have the service to the government and most of all, corruption will be lessened.
It is only right that if there is a need to remove them from service because there is no benefits to remove them especially since it is only the power of the former who received the qualifications.
