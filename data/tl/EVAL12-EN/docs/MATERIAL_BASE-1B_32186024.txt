Perhaps in the Philippines, it is probably happening in the Philippines that like a long time waiting for a long time waiting in different location of the route that Pope Francis will pass, so that they don't feel tiredness, hunger, and so long as they are already in position when they are already in office.
For a glimpse, a glimpse of a glimpse of the Pope is enough for the Pope to reconcile with the citizens, and what if the airplane can run, especially the youth, and will explode in the whole country as a sign of the arrival of the Pope.
But most of all, aside from the masses's happiness, they are now disciplined at the welcome of Pope Francis, and instead they respect it, it is not easy for them to do a chaos, or violence which is as if the government is expected to help from the people.
"The security case," said the police and military, that is really what the Aquino administration will think of because of his self, he is afraid of the people and many sins to pay for the country.
According to him, the citizens are aware of the leader who should respect and protect them because Pope Francis showed that he is a leader who is simple, humble and close to the people, he is being rude to the hearts of the country.
But he did not pay for this name because he showed up the movement, boastfulness or wealth, but the cooperation of ordinary citizens, which is why those who are corrupt politicians or bad people who does not want to reveal to the public.
According to him, if the morale and appreciation of the leaders of society is high, they will reap the respect, protection and love of the country.
And if not, they will reap the anger of the people until they are removed from duty.
