Edious: You asked the person, Mister President?
October 22, 2016.
The citizens now have the sentiments of the citizens now, before President Digong Duterte gives a word, especially in the International Airport, he needs to consider the interest and condition of the Filipino people inside and outside the Philippines.
Even the lawmakers and the members of the cabinet, there is only one request for the President, it is okay to be friends with others, it is better to have a new leader in Asia, but it should be better that there will be another country in Asia, but they should not be fighting with other countries and they have to have a long-time friend.
The President should understand that no matter how great his plan is for the Philippines, he will not be able to prove that their future is a nuisance, and he will do what he wants, that he is not necessary because he has won and he is the one seated in position.
Nothing will be lost if you ask, consult and listen.
Just like the billions of fulfilling of President Digong to his China visit.

A big part of this is debt.
It is the fight and separation from the US for a long time, not only in the military, but also in the economy, how can the work of millions of Filipinos hanged in the US Industries which led to now they do not pay attention to the teasing of our leader.
There is a controversial statement of the President of China to say that "the Scarborough Shoal is really owned by China, why is it that the Filipinos are fighting for us," that's why we won the UN Arbring to Tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
This is the worry of everyone that maybe there is a sign for President Digong to China and Russia who are both European countries.
It is right that even the main leaders are right, but it is still important to be sensitive to the voice and true needs of the nation and the people should be clear to the people where the country is brought.
