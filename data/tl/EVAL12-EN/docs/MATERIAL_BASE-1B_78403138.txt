Be determined for the experts.

It has been revealed that the criminal negligence of the regime of Noynoy Aquino in relation to the devastation of the onslaught of typhoon Yolanda in the country is exposed and it is certain that there is an alternative that is being used in social media, but it is certain that the data and information being served in social media, which is certain that they have tried to bring peace to his commentary against those who are damaged, in the narrow-mindedness of this.
For most netizens, for some netizens, for those who are educated, for those who are educated and to be in favor of the regime of the Philippines, they are in favor of the administration's response, according to the administration's response, it is a sign that there will be an expert in the administration of the Philippines, a proof that he will need an expert in the administration of the Philippines, a proof that he will need an expert in the administration of the Philippines, and according to the management and plans of Akbayan.
But because of defending the Aquino administration, who is currently the patron of Akbayan, it is not yet done by Claudio Aceret, it is not yet allowed to stop the discontusion of our community, "it appears that those who are fighting against the Aquino administration are being caught because of the severe damage from the Aquino administration; and the experts have to make peace because of the severe damage from the Aquino administration; and the experts can make it because of the severe damage from the Aquino administration; and the experts can make it because of the severe damage from the Aquino administration; and the experts cannot say anything.
But what is coming out, Claudio Aceret, the local government of CNN that the local government of Tacloban has promised that the local government is responsible for what he said, that is why it should be blamed for the local government of Tacloban to tell what he said, that is why it can be blamed if Aquino won't be blamed?
And what is bad with what the witnesses of CNN say, isn't it easy to see that there is a big failure if the national government leave the country, especially in one of the poorest sector of the local government, especially in one of the poorest sector of the local government, especially in one of the poorest sector of the local government, that is why it's not being criticized even by the national governments of Wa businessman in the US so that it should not be criticized in a state that has no ability in Tacloban.
There is another reason, Claudio Aceret, why it should not be said by the witnesses of CNN, aside from this, we need to accept the mentioned truth, but despite this, we need to accept the mentioned truth, but in spite of what we have done, this is contrary to what we need to gather such as the strength of the spirit as country. "
In this part, Claudio Aceret, in his field of experts, particularly the women who have passed by the victims of violence which have been used by foreign power and local government, which is the one responsible for the people who passed through it, which is also responsible for the many problems he is facing now.
Whatever it is, the events proved that Claudio Aceret, the events that are needed before, last November. 13, of those affected are the initial measure of the International Abilympics which was launched by the International Day of Solidum! "Was an accomplice of the Supreme Court which was launched by the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office 4 because it was an accomplice of the regime in the local government that took the supreme court.
In the research, Claudio Aceret, of course, of course, the anticipated tragedy, that even if we do the best, we can still wait for a few days before launching a heavy tragedy, that is why it is the best that the national government showed that is why the result is a severe tragedy.
What's worse is, the defense of Claudio Aceret, she is asked to think about the outline of "Filipino-spiritual belief that we need to be determined," if you are holding the "spiritual belief that we should do," if it's the second, the second in whatever of the two, we have a fence in the actual topic.
In relation to Yolanda, we need the strength of the spirit as town not to surrender to the possibility, that during the actual issue, it is impossible that there will be a bigger challenge in the country, it is impossible that there will be a bigger problem in the beginning of CNN that it is impossible for us to face the existing system, except for those who have interest in taking care of the funds and positions in the elected government.
