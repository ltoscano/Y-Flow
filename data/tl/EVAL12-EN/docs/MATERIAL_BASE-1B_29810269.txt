When will the air that be removed from the QC.

The life of the Quezon City government failed to have an international tax right now in order to reach the different kinds of needs of the local government of Quezon City (QC).

According to Johnny Chambers, an avid critics of the current administration, are opposed to their plan on the increase of tax, and saying the QC will not increase in order to reach the public funds and improve the primary needs and service to the public.

He also appealed to the public and from Quezon City, to be alert and refuse any proposal regarding the increase of tax in the said city, because there is a reserved "pork barrel" because it is enough for the needs of all the expenses in Quezon City.

"There is no strong basis for the increase in tax and only one thing that Mayor Herbert M. Bautista is not given taxes as a wind which is now being treated."

He also said that the QC's 2 billion pork barrel for the calamity has not been used yet, while the office of the mayor has personal budget that costs 300 million pesos.

Meanwhile, Johnny Chance also said that last 2001, the increase in tax was just as mayor, and now he inherited 1 billion budget, and now he was left behind 1 billion budget when he was left behind the budget, which costs P100 million in the next year.

Listen to what Johnny Chance is saying, three days of talking (Jan 8-10) in the program "Health and Travel, to the public," at the Discipline Office of 9: 00-10: 00-10: 00-10: 00-10: 00-10: 00-10: 00.
