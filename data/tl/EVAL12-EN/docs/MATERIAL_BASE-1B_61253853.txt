Sacrifice.

Sacrifice.

(MK. 10: 28-31)

We are really familiar with the words sacrifice, that means that you have a better chance for a more meaningful and higher appreciation.

But you know that the words sacrifice will come from the word of Latin America, this word is from the words of Latin America, which means that this is a holy thing which means that this will be whole, this will be built next in the holy Week.

In good governance, Pedro mentioned their sacrifices and left their family in order to follow Jesus.

Jesus also said that because of their sacrifices, you will receive a reward and in the end you will achieve eternal life.

This is what is happening, when there is something that has been discussed, it will be good that it will not go to nothing and it will not go to no matter what we are saying and this is the most important thing, and this results are becoming holy and the person you make is becoming holy.

Do you have a lot of sacrifice in your life?
