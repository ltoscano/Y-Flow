Perfect for Si!

Did President Aquino take after his brother Kris? Or Christian Ita, the one who supported him... that he is the slave at her.
Well, if Kris could make it a lesson from this, it would be better that it would happen to PNoy.
Like that, it's as if he / she was able to look at her. "
Vice-President Jojo Binay has a trace of PNoy that only two President asked to talk in Malacañang recently, the conversation admitted by Malacañang was fulfilled.
Binay's media will strengthen himself in order to fix the president after that conversation.
Because Binay is envious of DILG Secretary Mar Roxas that they are two of PNoy who are involved even if there is a throwing of mud and maybe it is possible that it will be exiled by PNoy in the 2016 presidential elections.
But our beloved President has a priority.
It is not enough for PNoy to shout that VP Binay is a liar when he assures that the Vice-President is a liar so he supports the Vice-President to ask him to investigate the issue of corruption and ill-mannered family.
He / she was wearing.
It's not only that someone received a lesson, with the brains of PNoy.
Hey, in front of the foreign media, the President threatened his critics and the people who filed a case and will take revenge on him when he will be attacked by them if he is not in power.
If not a child, it is really a child.
Is PNoy threatening him not to try this or he is doing this so that he will not file a case against them if he is no longer in position?
It looks like PNoy already knows that if he is not in Malacañang, he will be hacked up by the cases, which is possible to be the cause of his imprisonment.
Do he think, he was even caught in the case even if he gets bitten by various complaints?
So you turned to me, our president.
Do you clean all of your Badjaos, that is why your fear might be true.
It would be obvious that you are afraid to be imprisoned in case of plunder, if there is something.
