PNoy does not wait for Chief Justice Renato Corona.

President Noynoy Aquino wasn't able to negotiate with the former Barangay Chairman Renato Corona.
It is obvious that he has a fault in the country and they violated the law so that he will be punished.
It is also clear on the 20 senators who are convict for Corona who did not pursue his SALN of all the properties which is why there is no need for what happened but this is only one of the Saligang Batas of the Saligang Batas of the country.
The people can also feel that the impeachment court is right under thorough investigation because it is clear in public opinion that there are only a few who believes that Corona is an accident.
It's because in the straight path that President Noynoy Aquino is taking advantage of its campaign against corruption and guilty in the country, that is why it is just right to apply for all people even if it is an ordinary employee or a tree of the Supreme Court.
The beauty of the past events, all politicians or men are woken up because what happened to Corona may end because it is clear to them what happened to Corona.
What President Noynoy Aquino wants to do is simple and that is as the day of thieves and crooks in the government even if you are serving in the past administrations or involved in the government for now because the straight path will be run over to everyone.

Customs Commissioner Ruffy Biazon is still so out of control.
It turns out that the campaign and change being implemented by Biazon in the agency he governs will not be put in order.
This is not only made by it quickly, but what is important here is that it is in the right path, because it has been a long time for the corrupt people to have a lot of challenges as the president of the country for a long time!
