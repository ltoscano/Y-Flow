Is it a promise that it is just the election, PDU 30?
October 4, 2016.
After the declared winner in the previous Presidential election last May 11, 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte and the leaders of his speech during the campaign period, he promised that the moment he will be elected as the president of the country will change his speech.
The President became controversial not only in our country but in the whole world because of his curses.
In fact, some of our countrymen are becoming in the same time and if President Duterte does not care about his speech, it is sad because instead of putting his credibility and his credibility ends, he might give attention to his credibility and that he gives attention to his credibility and his credibility ends.
Also because of the cursing, the speech of the President is different, which is why he is able to ask for an apology because he is used to ask for an apology because he earns criticisms from his critics and the international community.
That's why we hope that in the following days, a President did not prepare for everything.
Most of all should be worried about our President that he is one of the cursing except for fighting against illegal drugs, crime and corruption is what he promised to do in the moment the president of our country is.
