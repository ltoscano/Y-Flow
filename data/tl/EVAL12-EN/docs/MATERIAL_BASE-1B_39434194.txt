We can do: Duterte and Robredo, united for the country.
According to him July 8, 2016, it's good that the start of the new administration is good because instead of seeing our president and Vice President, they saw that President Rody Duterte and Vice President Leni Robredo ran away.
The campaign and election became hot so after the election, the conflict between their supporters is still ongoing, that's why they immediately see each other and talk to the entire Philippines that they can help each other so that they can help each other in order to provide aid to the problems faced by our country.
It is also good that Robredo expressed support to the administration of Duterte, because in what he did, it is sad that Robredo and the LP have no dreams that it is possible that there will be a President of our country, that is why there is no truth in the rumors coming out because instead of helping it to our country, it will affect our country.
Duterte also said that it would be good for Robredo to visit him in Malaca√±ang, according to Duterte, Robredo's part is part of the administration that is why it is important that they work together for the betterment of our country.
If this kind of relationship will continue, it is not far to fulfill what we want to achieve the crime in our country and to improve the crime in our society and to improve those in our society and to improve the Lord Almighty for them to lead good and sensible people in our country.
