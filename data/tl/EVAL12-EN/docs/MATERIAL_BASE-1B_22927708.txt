I am confused.
I was the one who said that he / she was the one who told my voice.
They think about it.
You here, whatever you are here at work, you think you are at work.

We talked to each other when Baby James was still talking to you, "when we talked, we talked to each other.
Yes, i'll go to school; I said, "I was still on duty; he / she was still on duty, she said that many were able to tell something like that, and I was not talking about something like that," I was not talking about something like that.
She said to me.
"What could be done in me, that's why it's me, that's why he / she was being beaten-up; he / she was able to send money to each other; he / she was able to send money to each other; that maybe, it is signal that I am outside.
