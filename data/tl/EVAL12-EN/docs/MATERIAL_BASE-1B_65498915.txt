I want that... you are okay,: Reflection for the 28th Easter Sunday, which is an hour of B-October 14, 2012.

"I want you to be happy!" This is what many of us want to be happy, especially to our Filipinos, to be happy, but in truth, we want to be happy and experience no matter to us, but it is enough for us to forget a lot of our problems and poverty in life.
"How will I be real happy?" Maybe it is also one of your questions that we should be obedient to the law, "what we want to be happy is that," what we want to happen to us is sad, "what we want to be happy is what we want to happen to us," what we want to be happy is what we want to happen to us, "what we want is to be happy in our life."
