January 6, 2017.
119th Independence Day is released by Memorandum Number 13 to the Palace of Malaca√±ang in relation to the Miss Universe pageant of the country this month.
The Miss Universe 2016 will be held on January 30 in the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay City.
According to MC number 13, the Department of Tourism (DOC) can ask for help or support to all the department department, Bureau, any office or agency including the local government units (LGUs) who helped the DOT) to help the DOT).
But despite the requested support of Malacanang to all the offices of the government, it has emphasised that it will not be affected by the daily operations of the government offices.
Aside from that the operation of the office will not be hit, there is also a need to release the said office from the country's funds.
The release of Malacanang is clear that it is clear in Malacanang that is why it should be clear to all the offices of the government so that there will be no hit by the blame in the end.
The actual support of Miss U Pirates regarding this is that the agencies and department of our government are very quick to fulfill because they have resources but like the instruction of the government's office and funds of the government in helping.
The primary reason why this should not spend money is because there is a private sector that will shoulder all the expenses in the upcoming Miss Universe.
