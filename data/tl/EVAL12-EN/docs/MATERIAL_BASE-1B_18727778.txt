Raise the rehabilitation center.
July 17, 2016 - the intense problem of the local government units (LGUs) for drug addicts that surrendered as a result of the intensified campaign of the Duterte government against illegal drugs.
It is because the wolves attacked in number of deaths and drug pushers, which is why they do not know how to face them.
Anyway, the incident was sudden and has no concrete plan to address the problem because we really know that the funds of LGUs are limited because we know the severe needs for the national government to address the national government.
We are not contented with the sudden downpour of those who are involved in illegal drugs because it is proof that this is a serious problem of society on illegal drugs and positive on the side of the government, which is the primary cause of the campaign against illegal drugs.
Due to the extreme need to address the needs of LGUs, we support the call to give importance to the government on this issue.
Hopefully there will not wait for the next year for services of funds to be used for the rehabilitation of those who surrendered and the arrested drug user who surrendered because it is now needed.
We believe like what Senator Vicente Sotto said, which is just an executive order for any proposals that the government can do to support our fellow countrymen who want to change their lives and finally get back on the use of illegal drugs.
Anyway, the government of Duterte hopes to change our fellow Filipinos and use illegal drugs by our support through the tear for them to make all the needs to be safe from illegal drugs.
