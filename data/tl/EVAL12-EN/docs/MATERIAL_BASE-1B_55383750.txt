"Mr. Come AR" S" Senator Guingona and NCRPO blind.

If you will believe the act of Senator Panfilo Lacson during the hearing that the "Blue Ribbon Committee" can say that he is a "Mr. Clean" or it is clear that he is just a "Mr. Clean" or it is clear that he is just the entire Senate and all the officials of the government, the one who did not stole!
He is the only one who took a bath and did not do anything wrong, Senator TG Guingona only made a mistake, all is dirty, all were made wrong and all are thieves!
Just like that, Sen. Guingona only has the right to get a rock and give it to the mistakes like what the Lord Jesus said!
Because of that, we really salute Nepo for being a hypocrite! "Ehek!
However, in any action that Senator Guingona is clean, the senators who are members of the Senate blue ribbon committee of his reported committee are allegedly being investigated.
Because it was found out that the said report has not yet reached the said report, but it appears that Mister Clean was just out of their own opinion.
The report that we are talking about is to prove that Senator Enrile, Revilla and Estrada have been charged with plunder case.
The truth is, we are one of those who joined alcohol when the Ombudsman stated that they will file a case against the mentioned senators even if Senator Guingona cannot be "epal"!
Just a few moments, it is not that the senator also received 50 million pesos from DAP, which according to Senator Jinggoy Estrada, "PNoy's bribe to the senators in the midst of the impeachment of ex-CJ Corona?
Isn't it possible that he / she also received any kind of PDAF that was declared to be illegal and being taken by the Supreme Court?
Hmmmp! Just a moment, Mister Clean, do not be able to make it first to the others that you carry you, sir, to your own head, sir, to your own head!
