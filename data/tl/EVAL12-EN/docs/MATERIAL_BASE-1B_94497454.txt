A new market in Malolos, tomorrow.

July 6, 2016 Shane F. Velasco.

City of Malolos, July 6 (Pia) - you will not be able to get along with the thick smoke in the road, and it could not be replaced by a few million pesos in the middle of the burned market in August 3, 2012.

It's because the primary road going to the market (CLLD / Vila-Pia 3) was opened to the motorists.
