Charter change in Retiro Street.

Why is the national leadership charter change in Charter change?
Two process that can be stabbed in the place which is being stabbed in the construction of the ruined community, if they will really be elected by the Congress, just like the supreme court, the Constitution, and this is what was done in the Philippines in 1970, and this is what was done in the Philippines last 1970 under the regime of Marcos.
It is said that it would be said that it will be good for the change that will change or support the full of the new Constitution, what is the primary influence of the whole country, how can it be considered as the main influence of the country's administration, that is why it can be expected that this is the primary influence of the national leadership, how it can be considered as the holy document to the group of Filipinos.
As early as early as now, the goal of false gods and businesses that are growing up in our own town is to dismiss any limitation of land and buildings, and even if it is only a few families who owns more than 50 percent of land in the Philippines, and even for a few families, the Filipinos are holding and controlled by the Filipinos for the sake of the national security.
If the society sector does not have a hard time, he insists that the tone of a charter change will continue to expose and strengthen the national interest and sovereignty that is why it will not happen that our country is always hungry in the leadership of the people who are opportunists and capitalist countries in the leadership of Uncle Sam?
The said holy church was said to just endure and pray!
