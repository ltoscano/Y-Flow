Candidate who will stop the anti-cybercrime law.

Did you notice something about the majority of the candidates of PNoy and Binay and Binay?
Blind, however, they are deaf to the crying of young media about libel which contains the anti-cybercrime law.
When Asilo is still seated, they are continuously criticizing the discrimination and harassment of its government.
But now, they are going to be ashamed of the repressive said law.
This law is already signed by PNoy, boss, Juan Ponce Enrile, on the Palace of lawmakers from the Legislative Chamber and Senate.
In the 24 candidates for senators who are opposing parties, only two are clear against libel the said law: Chiz Escudero and Peter Cayetano.
"The human rights that was formerly, Wa, also a voice.

The speculation of this, regular patrons, so almost all of the candidates are silent, deaf and blind to the danger brought by libel to the said law, they will benefit from it today.
It's because politicians or candidates have already started doing something wrong, and for just a case that will file a case in Oamen, the mouth of these.
This is due to the usual order given by the court on the case they are holding.
They don't want the rotten system to know the news on the internet about their fear that they will be defeated by the election in 2013.
It's because, if the news will pass, television and radio are the news from their rottenness, it is hard to make it through the internet and there will be more free to release their opinions and will be protected.
But freedom is gone on the internet and just ignore these politicians.
I hope you should keep it!
