Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle's message to number Manila Development Authority (2015) by the letter in buying.

Cardinal Tagle, together with Aida Seone, was a victim of attempted murder in his life in Toril, Davao City, which killed his own person in Kathy Yamzon.

It was a message that Cardinal Tagle is reading on the quick action of the Lumad and the Mindanaoan last November 11, 2015 it is saddening that what is happening to our fellowmen, those who have been forced to evacuate and killed, many of them were forced to evacuate and left their homes.

It was spoken by Jesus that we can do it or we can't do it for the best of our siblings "they are doing or not doing anything for him (cals, Mt 25: 40, 45).

That is why, with what is happening to our siblings, indigenous people in Mindanao, we need to respond and act on us, first, to our fellowmen, indigenous people, who are forced to leave their homes, and currently, in the "evacuation centers.

They need, most of them, for food, medicine, concern and understanding, we should also do everything to return to their home and land, and we should also do everything to return to their home and land, and we should be held accountable and charged by the authorities for those who sinned and kill the leaders of our siblings.

We need all to sit, talk, and help each other so that we can make sure that what happened to our siblings, indigenous people, we should give us a chance to fix everything, fix everything, and let peace prevail.
