Senior Myrna, DC.

Amalia Fuentes, DC (Mt. 10: 34), said that she has not seen her family for a long time, but when he entered the funeral home of Jesus: "When he entered the funeral home of Jesus:" He was not deserving to help me by the poor, especially by the indigenous people, especially by the indigenous people, especially by the indigenous people, especially by the natives.

For Senior Myrna, what is important is to follow the will of God.

Jesus: "It is said that anyone who take care of him will lose his self, and it can be found out that she has been losing his self," if it is already far, she already has a good partner, perhaps he already has a good life and can help in his family.

But he forget himself and he said, how can he be forced to share with the fight of those who have no voices from the society, they also know that in spite of the indigenous people, especially the indigenous people, especially the indigenous people who lost their lives in this world.

Myrna, she had a life in eternal happiness in the company of Amang loving.
