A gay man.

"It is said that a tomboy is not a real woman," said he is gay, not a real man.
But recently, there is one story for the three gay people who showed up the attitude that many say is a tight and real man.
The story of Peter, Ram, and Momar, published in one newspapers, gave inspiration.
The three gay victims were held by rebels, together with others.
But instead of taking advantage of the serious situation he was in, he served as the strength for his fellow hostages that gave joy and gave help to the best of his ability.
That's why the companions were amazed, they had a strong feeling and lost hope.
As of now, members of the third sex are becoming famous as the center of various competitions in TV, those who are delighted with the movies and send a joke to stage play.
But what is their contribution to the people?
But again and again, they showed the wealth of their will as the entire people, as Filipinos like Peter, Ram, and Momar.
The story of these three should present the movies, the story of the heroism that they showed, that was firm and tried to be brave and let the safety of others, to make it straight and repeat it.
The gay men act as a real man but they do not need to call it like that because they are real people, who are similar to them, who will raise the situation of gay people who will defend their race against the reconciliation of her and harassment.
We have known a lot of people like them but their story has not yet been managed.
That's why in the next time many of us will see a gay and tomboy, remember the story of Peter, Ram and Jomar, and Jackie's opinion to see their physical appearance to see their real character.
