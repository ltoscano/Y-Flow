Changes in Subic and Makati.

Recently, the group of National Press Club (NPC) went to the leadership of President Benny Antiqua in Subic to attend and witness the new administration of press Corps, which is now being led by the new administration of press Corps.
In our district in Subic, we saw a lot of changes there, not only in the rules but also in the reforms and programs being implemented there, and this good change is happening under the leadership of the SBMA Chairman Roberto V. Garcia who is a architect of different policies.
We interviewed Garcia that he will be removed from his position but because it is good, he revealed his thoughts about the planned presence of the US Navy in the ocean part of the Philippines like Scarborough or Scarborough Shoal.
According to him, it is also a big help in the tourism of Subic, Olongapo and other nearby towns where the warship of their area will anchor in their area.
Meanwhile, the change is still being discussed, many citizens in Makati have been hoping for good and meaningful changes in Premiere City of the country.
And one of the active officials that is expected to drop reforms for the welfare of the citizens is Vice Mayor Kid Pena.
Kid is active in the programs giving attention and help to the poor residents of the city this past week, along with the PNP and even the Emmanuel Church Minahan ng Kiangan), for the successful medical mission in Barangay Valenzuela.
Because of this, many people were given treatment and medicine for different diseases that caused him to be the attention of the people of Makati.
That's why I can say that because of the good leaders of the government like Chairman Garcia and Vice Mayor Kid, and other like them, those who give many people in hope have a good future for our country.
