I am rude.

There's really a severe intoxication of the Philippine National Police Chief Director General Alan Purisima.
Even the lawmakers, particularly here is Senator Grace Poe, he did not mind the invitation to face the invitation so that he will face the Senate and explain to the worsening criminality in our country.
President Aquino has a patience because he is really taking the behavior of this child!
If he did not neglect Senator Poe, he should have been respected in his position.
Even if you are the only ones who are your enemies, sir, do you think that your power will be finished and if it happens, you think you will still remain allies?
Although we can understand if Purisima is not able to attend the Senate hearing, he said that he asked permission.
He is educated and as a official of the PNP, we are expecting that he is a gentleman.
Well, it is said that Purisima has no notice that Purisima does not have any notice that he will not shout at the hearing of the Senate which is the reason why Poe is hot-headed.
It's good that even if he is mad, Poe is still calm and is still calm that's why I think he will reach far from politics.
Just imagine, his personnel did not have a proper explanation when Senator Poe confronted him.
"Oh," isn't that a sound? "
It seems that his head is really so big because President Aquino is being caught in spite of his failure as the chief of PNP.
It looks like PNoy is still not proud of what he did to him then by Purisima, which is why he's being neglected for his dehumanies.
But do this with stone.
Purisima will also pay for his debt to our citizens.
We do not know when this will happen, but it is certain that Purisima will be liable of our citizens.
