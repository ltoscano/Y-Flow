De Lima and Soliman: Sereno.

It is possible that there will be no debt of gratitude or not going near to President Benigno Maria Lourdes Sereno for President Benigno Aquino III if he directly admitted that he is not a puppy of the President.
The Barangay magistrate is firm that this will not serve as a president and he does not need to be good to anyone because he maintained the judicial system. "
That is why Sereno shows his bravery to turn around with President Aquino especially when the Disbursement Acceleration Program of Malaca√±ang (DAP) has been declared.
The administration of Pres. Noynoy stated that the Supreme Court is too powerful which is why he presented that he is open to the amendment of the Constitution to check the power of the court.
PNoy really cannot understand that the power of three branches of the government is equal.
It's because he thought that because he was assigned to Sereno as Chief Justice, the reason why he could not be applied.
It's a big mistake by President Aquino that he was compared to Chief Justice Secretary Leila de Lima and Social Welfare Secretary Dinky Soliman that will rise up and like robots that are following each of his ordered.
There is an honor and resolve, CJ Serano, so his mandate did not change, even the people voted in the country and not for the President.
The government should only support judicial reform so that the hearings and giving proper discipline to those in court have the goal is to bring back the trust of the citizens in the judiciary.
That is why de Lima and Soliman hopes to imitate her.
He is full of mouth but all following their boss is what they are doing.
Sereno, a woman, but there are "balls" who gave the real service to the citizens and not the President.
The caraving of Services Program (GAS) is successful in Malate prime made in Catanauan, Quezon. Thank you!
