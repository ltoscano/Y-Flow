We can be proud of.

The countries from Cambodia, Palestina, as long as well as Herpes Zurbano mother, are included in the countries-in-list or Single Entry SEC.
We don't hear the said countries often, in the gather of good movies, not included in the Philippines with the said party list.
We might not pay attention to it because we are not often part of the nominated in the Oscars that we mentioned.
Meanwhile, this is being discussed because along with the news on the Oscars that was the opening of the Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF).
Every time it is like this, he is full of Tagalog movies.
There is no mix of foreign movies to attract Filipinos to support the filipino movies, especially this Christmas season when it comes to the families and it is easy to show money because of the celebration of Christmas.
There are ways to watch, there is action and comedy.
But now, the question has come out - what is being done in the MMFF or there are people who are trying to create classes in the Oscars, as they say?
There are many documents in the industry of Filipino movies, but the painful truth is that they are against the movies that the only quality is to be turned down or in the box office.
Before, it is not like this, in the past decades, we have seen a quality movie - the script is good, good actors and high kinds of direction.
In the Oscars, as they say in the movies in the MMFF of 2013, in your opinion, which can be in the Oscars?
We need to look at the small countries that we have mentioned so that we will take movies for those who have entered the Oscars.
We understand that we need to earn, but it should be balance and the quality of movies should be raised.
It is fine for the viewers, especially this Christmas, but hopefully, it should not be neglected but it should not be neglected, the quality of growth, and we should be proud of somehow.
