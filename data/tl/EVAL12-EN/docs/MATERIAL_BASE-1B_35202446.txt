They are stranded.

It is said that thousands of passengers are holding the passports of other countries and even stranded.
But it is likely for the Filipinos' camp now at the embassy of the Philippines in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, not only stress but trauma in their suffering and lack of security in the said kingdom.
Anacorta, boxing, IOS, Trefaldighets, TNT 363, different from different countries, he was referring to the OFW who were called illegal because there was no direct document at work and working in the country he is facing.
No matter who is asked, no one will tell anyone what he will choose to be one of those who will tell him that he would want to work and live outside the Philippines if there is only enough and decent livelihood in the Philippines.
They say they are illegal and should be arrested and punished.
But before they become a hero, the condition of abuse and taking advantage should be there first like most of those who ran away from Jeddah, they have experienced the violation of their rights.
After all, the camp of the city in Jeddah said that it is estimated that more than four million Filipinos are going to leave the whole world as an estimated number of four million those who registered in the whole world, more than four million those who registered in the whole world when the government of the Philippines has told the Philippines of its program for repatriation.
The number of those stranded is just a proof that there is a failure and there is no truth in the promise that they will be brought home by the Aquino government.
It is said that the government needs to be stranded in other countries.
What I can say: The poverty, desperation and livelihood, negligence of the government - that is the mark of being stranded OFWs.
