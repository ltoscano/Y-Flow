It's the revelation of frogs.

Frogs (MK. 10: 45-45) have a story regarding a few days that they saw a frog like a few days since they saw a frog in his stomach so that he saw a frog in his stomach, right? "When he saw a frog in his stomach, it was bigger that he saw a frog in his stomach so that he could not accept that there was a lot of frogs in his stomach," that was why he could not accept that there was a big similarity from him. "

Ammcommissioners, in social media, that is what we call from the people who have wanted to get up in society even in a bad way, drinks, drinks, and other ways to be used to notice and have a law like that.

The siblings, Juan and Jaime said to Jesus: "Give us to your glory that one of us wants to be first, and one of your left you, he is the one who wants to be first for you, but after the election, he still wants to be good for those who won in order to be given a good position.

In the church there are also those who are similar to the priest or are the Bishop to give them the power and good chair.

When they speak and act, they seem to be the priest or the Bishop!

Let us be like Jesus: Qualified to serve and not to serve him.
