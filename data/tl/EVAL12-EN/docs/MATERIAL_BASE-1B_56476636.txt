Our problem is our problem.

Everyday we can read or hear the news about sickness from the virus that has Ebola.
Even the powerful President of America, Barack Obama is personally included in the steps made in the US to eradicate the spread of disease from the virus.
Even here in the Philippines, the agencies of our government are also talking about how to stay our safety against this illness which is quickly spreading in the countries where this is the start of Africa.
According to animals, Ebola virus is coming from animals, they say it is because the virus is coming from and spread to people.
The victim's death was quick and quick.
As of now, the Philippines has Ebola and firm the campaign to maintain this through a thorough investigation of the visitors coming from the countries who have Ebola.
Even Filipinos who go home here who can come from the country who have cases of Ebola can be investigated.
But it should not only be done here, our knowledge should be deeper about this for our safety.
Thousands have died about Ebola after the story of the families of the victims, especially the children who were orphaned and no one wants to marry because of fear of this illness.
Our prayers should not reach our country about Ebola and no Filipino is infected by the deadly virus.
But we also offered prayers to the victims without fighting against Ebola.
The pain in my mind started about Ebola in a poor country.
Poverty and lack of facilities for cleanliness is one of the reasons why the world has a huge problem in the world.
Poverty is the corner of many of our problems, let us pray that poverty can be stopped in the world.
