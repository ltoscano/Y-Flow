Even the remaining pork barrel is being monitored.

At first, I am in favor for the victims of the earthquake to give the remaining money from the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF).
I am in favor if the spending of money will be in order to recover from our countrymen in Bohol and Cebu.
But when I found out that Senator Franklin Drilon and some senators are trembling with the plan of spending on the funds by accepting President Noynoy Aquino to transfer to the Presidential calamity which is dangerous.
We are afraid that it is possible that Malaca√±ang and the politicians will feel different money.
If the funds really wanted to help the victims of the earthquake, why is there a need to make the hands of PNoy?
We have no more confidence over PNoy because of a friend who became a friend of the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) fund that he divided to his co-senators and congressmen in order to sweep the Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona.
Drilon has the biggest money from DAP that made the distribution of money and if not Senator Jinggoy Estrada, he will not allow it.
Now, Drilon is being carried out to release the "savings," if it is not yet released by the Supreme Court or if he did not stop it, it was said that it was taken from the crocodile.
It was even used by a deacademia which is said to be the welfare of the victims of the earthquake.
The question on the face of PNoy and Drilon should not be trusted that we should be made a mistake by the President to watch out and let us not let them be given by the inhumane who are the people's money.
Hopefully the pork barrel scam will finally be removed and the Supreme Court should also decide on illegal DAP.
This fund will be saved by the agencies that should have been quick to pay attention to the programs of the government but the thieves are complicated.
