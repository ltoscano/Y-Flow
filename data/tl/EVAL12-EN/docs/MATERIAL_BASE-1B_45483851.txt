Ate Vi will beat Chiz.

Who is saying nothing will be defeated by Senator Chiz Escudero in the moment he run as vice president of Senator Grace Poe? This is not true that it does not mean that the votes of Grace are also the votes of Chiz.
And it is more dangerous for Chiz to be the star for the half-year-old Batangas Governor Vilma Santos for his addiction to the coming 2016 elections.
It is certain that Chiz will have a lot and may even be defeated by Ate Vi when they meet two president.
Aside from the solid vote, Ate Vi will surely get away from his fans and colleagues in showbiz, he also has a strong support not only in Batangas, but in Metro Manila, even in Visayas and Mindanao.
The tandem Vilma and doesn't do anything; the movies Traels, Darna Ligas and even Burleson, queen is still in the consciousness of the public and this will be the will of Ate Vi to talk about Chiz.
It's not only in showbiz that Ate Vi is not only in showbiz; she also tried to come from politics.
It is not tainted by corruption that up to now is a clean image as a public servant - it is contrary to it that Chiz is there.
Chiz said no matter of course, except when Grace is on the bottom of the skirt of Grace, she is hoping that the time Grace Poe-Chiz will push through is that he will be brought by his popularity.
But in the moment of Ate Vi's candidacy, Chiz's happy days are over.
His dream of becoming a vice president will start a trace and hope that the arrogance of politicians will stop.
