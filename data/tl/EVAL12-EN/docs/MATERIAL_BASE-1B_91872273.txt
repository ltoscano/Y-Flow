Recruitment and OFWs in Saudi have long been stopped.
Bira Masukat, August 11, 2016.
The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) confirmed through POEA Administrator Fr. Wanda Teo and Filipino workers in Saudi Arabia.
There was no date for the POEA Admin promises that the POEA have long stopped signing of Filipino OFWs in Saudi.
If this is the situation, the POEA should inform this to our fellow OFWs who are continuously hoping that he can work in another country including Saudi Arabia, until now, we still have a lot of fellow OFWs who are waiting for their questionable orders in Saudi.
They are calling on different kinds of work of the widespread Recruitment and sanitation in the country, but the truth is there is no waiting job for OFWs because the POEA stop merits.
The deployment today should be known to the POEA for OFWs so that our fellow countrymen who are hoping to make work in Saudi are pitiful because there is no waiting job for them because it is already prohibited by the government.
But for us, this decision of POEA is right because what is happening to our countrymen in Saudi are losing jobs.
They are extremely hurt because of the lack of protection to their employers, the officials of our government should focus on it.
It is good that Department of Labor Secretary Voltaire Gazmin and Bello will put out the situation of almost 9,000 OFWs in Saudi that are not able to go back to the country because of the many problems being faced like the lack of fare on the way home to the Philippines.
As of today, DOLE is taking care of all the need for the return of the country by those who have been stranded in Saudi and hopefully they can go back to their difficulty and be with their loved ones.
