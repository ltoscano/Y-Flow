P10.3 (Mt. 12: 46) the family is important for us in fact that it is your family who truly consider all things.

There are many other countries in order to support the family of where to live, they consider what is good for your family, especially when they get married, they are asking the reaction of the family if they will make a decision in life, what you think will be the family.

"Our family is part of all things that we should run to our world, we still have to run for our family, but we still have a high appreciation for the family of God, our mother and siblings."

"They are from the clan of Abrile and they are able to choose the town of God for them, they are only known by the Lord of God, the belief of the family of God, that they have chosen to follow the story of the Lord who chose to answer the Lord's plan.

And there is Jesus who said, "Nony, my will," I hope that we should always find and follow the will of God for us.
