Jiro, forever in the rehab!
"He is no longer normal," -- the AI G. RL-July 19, 2016. "Jiro Manio who is one of the things we talked to AiAi delas Alas when he signed the contract at Capitol Food Corporation.
Aiai would have not want to let Jiro's situation now because it is better that he is just quiet.
It was said that the incident was right when he was just returned to a rehabilitation center, but he did not want to tell the whole details because Jiro was just quiet in the rehabilitation center only because of the spread news that he was found dead in Cainta.
That's why AiAi delas Alas posted the conversation of both of them.
The truth is, it looks like Jiro has long time in the rehabilitation center.
The drug user is not a drug user but has no disease in thinking.
"His illness will no longer be seen, it's already different, but he / she wasn't able to go outside, it would be fine for him," AiAi delas Alas.
"In truth, for prayer, she is okay with that, but I did not tell him.
"
"I said, you will not kill you, as long as you are inside you, you will not die.
"He can't go out, he / she wasn't able to go out, but isn't it, I went to him?, isn't you wondering, I put him again?
"Because, he is not normal, anyway, he is saying many things that he is not normal.
"As long as Jiro is in a far place, he might be in the rehab for a long time because she is more than that.
"So that his life will not be confused," AiAi was even stated.
Meanwhile, AiAi was grateful to the Lord because he still continues to support the products he will endorse.
