The dead was killed!

This is what our countrymen did, including the rebel group of Muslims in more than 40 operatives of the Philippine National Police (PNP) in the province of Maguindanao.
When I heard the story of a police who were lucky to be saved from the said incident, I can say that what the culprits did was no joke but they were not joking with our government.
What the government of PNoy said about the investigation, what are they saying if there is a process done by the police victims?
In my opinion, the police are having a stray bullet in the area because we know that the government and the group of rebels in Mindanao will respect each other.
Let us think that the victims have violated the process but they are the government of our country and what hurts is the heinous murders.
It would have been better if he died in the encounter because the police called out that kind of operation and it was fine if the Muslim rebels were on alert because they were rebels.
The problem is already dead, the guns of the dead policemen were found after they were shot by a close range in the face or head, the victims quickly escaped.
Which is if President Mayor Erap Estrada is the only one seated in Malacanang, it is certain that the fight against the group of criminals which will be brought by the entire force of the military and police will be lessened.
I do not know here with PNoy, it seems that he is getting bullied in school because she is getting bullied in the school because it's obvious that PNoy is fond of songs which is too slow.
He / she was wearing.
