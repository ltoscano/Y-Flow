It is afraid that the only witness to the kidnapping of the soldiers of the government of the government of Edwin Ankara, former member of the NPA, that up to now they are still not making it look like the criminals.

Elena Gacing Estana, a councilor of Barangay San Jose, Bulusan, Sorsogon was together with Ankara when he was abducted by the soldiers last January 30.
Estana said, the military has a threat to him and his family, which is why he is hesitant to testify in the petition for the habeas corpus which wants to be filed by the family of Ankara to file a solution.

Edwin Anzon is continuously placed in danger until he is not making it look like he is the protection of Elena Estana, to encourage him to testify and help in searching for the victim.

We are calling out to the local government of Bulusan to give an additional help to Estana, if it is the initiative of the barangay officials, like him, the government troops are expecting that the ordinary civilians can be expected by ordinary civilians?

We also wish for the concerned members of the took place to give the human rights to give all the help to the witness and the family of the victim in order to solve this issue.
