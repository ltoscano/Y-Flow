A long time will come.

And it has become an issue if Janet Lim-Napoles can be taken into the investigation of the Senate.
Connected to legal basis is what will be followed by the Senate with Napoles or the law of the Ombudsman who is not allowed to interview the witness because he has a case.
Senator TG Guingona cannot stop himself from being irritated with the explanation of the Department of Justice about the not set of Napoles last day in the Senate.
We side with TG Guingona.
There are many questions about Napoles, and where Napoles gave a statement, why did he not do the Senate in front of some personalities that were also destroyed by the accused.
The man is angry.
They feel so bored of solution or any issue involving some big names in the world of politics.
Why did Napoles not force Napoles to tell all his knowledge?
Anyway, the politicians are not going to fight back from taking pictures on her.
Each has its own to avoid him.
Each has to deny that she is known or sometimes, they became closer to him.
Does Napoles have no friend from high positions in the government?
So he did not want to fool, maybe she could have narrated the story, and narrated the story.
There are also many who say that they are acting acting on Napoles.
Who is he hiding or afraid?
I am sure that if the people will be asked, there is no one who wants him to be put in danger because all of the things that she can do.
That's why Senator Guingona will be ill-tempered about the witness of the witness.
According to Guingona, there are a lot of questions by the senators, a lot of questions by the people.
Thank you to the country, it will come and we will come to a point where Miss Napoles needs to say.
The question is when.
