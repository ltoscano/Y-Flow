Is PNoy really not corrupt?

Before, PNoy is very angry at C5 Extension project of Manuel Villar that it was called by PNoy that the C5 project of Villar is full of corruption.
"We are on the straight path," PNoy is asking if there is no corrupt, "if there is no corrupt, there is no poor."
But PNoy supposedly blinked when he built the Team PNoy and he went along with the Nacionalista Party which the president Villar and his candidate, Senator Cynthia,.
PNoy will finally forget C5 Extension.
Is there truth with PNoy's allegation to Manny Villar, that we will not know that.
Two years August, PNoy is very angry at his State of the Nation Address (SONA) when he found out the Manila Film Festival (MWalis) that the officials and employees are taking advantage and received millions of pesos every month.
Dismissed from MWalis official and it was replaced by PNoy by his own personnel, the result: The happiness in MWalis and the Manila Film Festival and Maynilad is ongoing.
In the latest SONA of PNoy, he cursed at the Bureau of Customs (BOC) almost cursed because of being touched by the faces of the crooks in Customs.
"We already know you," PNoy warned.
Instead of expose their names, he just left Customs Commissioner Ruffy Biazon and Deputy Commissioner Danny Lim to expose their names.
Biazon and Lim won't have a name, instead, they ordered the officials to resign or be assigned to other positions.
In the case of the P10-ray of the pork barrel scam, why did PNoy not say about his SONA?
Is there really no corruption in their ranks?
