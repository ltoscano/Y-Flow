Eggplant becomes Vice President in social media.

Postanes and his mind.
On June 14, 2015.
In opinion.

Eker's time to post on TV in their website were the statements or things coming out from the mouth of the Binay, particularly Vice President Jojo about the politics, a number of those who gave the brutal slaying instead of getting a heated argument.
So if it is in social media to conduct a survey for the presidential election, it is VP Binay's VP Binay, Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, DILG Secretary Mar Roxas and ex-Senator Ping Lacson.
It's because these are reaching or "in social media are aware of what is happening in our country, they are observing the issues particularly the actions of every politician or our leader.
And while the election is getting nearer and the amount of information on social media is down, the trust can down from the surveys of VP Binay.
That's why it is not impossible to happen that before the election, 11-month from now, only his supporters will be left to Vice President even if there is a clear evidence of corruption, even if there is a clear evidence of corruption, there is no need to resign from Binay.
In the latest survey of Ibon Foundation, who went out of the other day, VP Binay and Senator Poe are equal to 13 percent, after Duterte (7.6 percent) and Roxas (3.8 percent).
The survey that we are waiting for is the SWS and Pulse Asia, let us wait if Binay has maintained the leadership or increase!
For the mentioned presidential candidates, VP Binay is the only one who declared.
We will know on October 12-16 to know who will run for president in our country for the next six-years.
Wait for it!
