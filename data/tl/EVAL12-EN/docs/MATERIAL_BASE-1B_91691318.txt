Know.

Know.

(Jugo, 12: 1-11)

Two people, we will see two kind of love today.

First, Maria is the sister of poison and Marta, in the arrival of Jesus, he took the expensive perfumes and put it to the feet of Jesus, but this is what Maria did to solve it with his hair.

Maria does not know, he is prepared for the coming death of Jesus.

On the other hand, Jay's love is there.

He only loved himself in the first glance that his desire to sell the expensive perfumes and to give the money from the poor was good because he used a lot of money because he used the poor to benefit from him.

Maria is his real love Jesus.

Today, we hope that our love for Jesus will be true, we are helping us because we love Jesus.

We are brave because we love Jesus.

Let us give the "best" to Jesus!
