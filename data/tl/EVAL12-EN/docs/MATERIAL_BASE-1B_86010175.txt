Pray always.

If the prayer you know is to give thanks, it is enough.

Prayer is thankful that it is not a way to ask for all sorts of things and prayer is the offer of your heart to our hearts, instead of accepting a heart, rather than the words uttered by our hearts, instead, she said that there is no heart disease.

You are not praying to ease your life, but to have a strong and strong shoulder to get a strong and failure, because of our weakness and trials, it will only be a burden to our weakness and skill at all of our weaknesses.

There are people who are praying for them to stay in danger, because you are praying to have the ability to face the Lord, instead, you are hoping that you are going to be calm and make sure that you are going to be calm, affectionate, and skillful in love.

The simple path: Peace is our prayer, faith and faith in love, love and love, serving and the most powerful, and the most powerful in all of this is the boundary.

History: Forgive my lack of meaning and I can also be given the people without meaning, especially those who are often talking about words that have no meaning.

Because the fire that was released by the Lord is a joke.
