Even before the race of "Manny Pacquiao has been identified as Manny Pacquiao in the field of boxing, Filipinos are already known as a race with good and courageous soldiers who were known because of their courage and skill in the struggle against foreign businessmen who want to be used for our country.
Despite the time passes, he did not lose his courage and skill in the fight of Filipinos, in fact that when I visited San Francisco, USA, she was still young when she learned a big sister to the guidance of her older sibling.
It was the decades that his father went to the United States and did not last long, the siblings decided to get the siblings, together with his mother, so that they would stay there in San Francisco.
In spite of being far from his own town, the Grand Arcillas continued the training of the Shrilling Chuang, a kind of martial arts skill that came from Japan.
His frequent training became fruitful, he became skillful in the field of martial arts skill with his five-year-old man and one woman.
It is also because of his unique behavior to the elder sister, it has not been enough for the Grand Master Arcillas, to stay with her and his children who have knowledge about it.
He built a school, which aims to suspend the youth who are also interested to learn - the Arcillas's wedding.
The ex-older sister's goal is not only to be ignored when she comes to his school, she also wants to teach the discipline and to make the young influence on the evil influence.
Many youth, whether Filipino or other race was being taught and become a student of the Grand Master Arcillas, from his courage, skill and skill in the chosen field, it is true that he got the only admiration but also the respect of these.
It's natural for our Filipinos to be courageous and daring. "As we" we were born, "we should remember that we have the ability to fight," we eventually succeed!
