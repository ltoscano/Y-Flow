2 tablespoons of fired by the chief of QCPD-DAID (2).

Let us continue the discussion of arrest and drugs of the Quezon City Police District District Anti-Illegal Drugs (DAID) that led by Supt. Richard Ang.
It was Friday when the parents of the young victim allegedly gave an agreement to 113 million pesos and just like what was done to his BF is in the barracks that they caught up and according to our source, PO 3 Joker Garcia himself received P1500,000 pesos from the young lady.
What is painful to the family of the young woman is that they did not follow their agreement that when the amount was given by the girl because according to Garcia, the said amount was a payment because according to Garcia, the case of the young lady Sec. 5 or soup was reduced because according to Garcia.
It was said that Garcia is said to be able to organize or arrangement of the QCPD-ComVal are said to be the one who received the two apples which was given by the parents of the man who was arrested with his girlfriend.
President Noynoy, where is the right way that you are telling in the right path, what happened to the roads? "
I salute QCPD Director General Mario dela Vega, because he was the only one who dared to remove them from the chief of DAID, Colonel Ang.
I hope this should not be taken away by the position especially the empty units that we know which is also a source of a lot of policemen.
Colonel Ang was fired by General Dela Vega, after the 3 prisoners escaped and the case immediately escaped, but before he finally left the DAID, they even got two apples and money after the arrest of the former girlfriend.
General Dela Vega, sir, now that the chief of QCPD-DAID are still new, it would be better if you remove all the people of Col. Ang, because if they stay there, it seems that the chief will just do anything that will give them money, especially this Garcia.
