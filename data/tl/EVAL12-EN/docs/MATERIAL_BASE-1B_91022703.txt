The BCDA has no space in Duterte.
By between Dacer-October 28, 2016.
The former administration of Bases Conro and Development Authority (BCDA) has all millions of pesos for different expenses including the legal case against the cases filed in different court in the country.
We have said that the BCDA has been squandered because the cases they filed will not happen again.
Just like the cases filed by the BCDA against Camp John Humalig), if it can be remembered, a case was filed by the BNational CA.
But it is sad that the result of this case will be defeated by BCDA and the government has not only made a severe loss because it was made to pay 1.42B as payment for the rent from 1996.
Because of the loss of defeat, it turns out that the BCDA has not thoroughly studied the legal way to chase the cases, which is why the result is a huge sum of the government through BCDA as the legal basis and payment for the rushing enemies.
We do not understand why the strategy of BCDA has become a failure in the previous administration that instead of helping a fund for the country, it has become a burden.
So our question is what is really the work of BCDA? We are just asking the previous administration like a lot of cases chased by BCDA in court, but in the end, there are still losses.
This failure should not be repeated and I believe that President Rodrigo Duterte will not neglect this kind of failure under the funds of the country because of the failure of the leaders.
