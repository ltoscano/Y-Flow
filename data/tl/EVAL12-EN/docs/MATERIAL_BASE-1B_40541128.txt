Fix the corruption of Navotas City?

I remember in an elementary and high school, "when we like the free viand, we are not going to go but to the coast of Navotas and Manila, Bay, like Malabon, we are carrying a sack and broken mosquito nets from under the sea.
Believe, there is no one hour, we are almost filled with a sack of "epal" or "Pogi" because it is a delicious taste of insults, rice and lobster which, if you are not used to the skin, you will surely be wounded.
Every part of Navotas were loose before even if the road is clean, if there are squatters, they will not be filled with squatters, you are very rich in all kinds of sea, you are very rich in all kinds of sea.
The City of Navotas has changed with a dirty and foul odor, the number of squatters, which are not only fishermen but are just meddling and in the corners of the sea.
Congressman Toby Tiangco said that before, he is the mayor of Navotas, many places are being annoyed and fixed that is why they are going to do a plan for a cheaper but the strong typhoon. "
The City of Navotas were rich with good boat and ships before, to repair the destruction of the ship where they want, and hope that they will be used in politics, and hopefully they will be used in politics, the strategy of fixing.
And hopefully, that the fishermen there have already been arrested, that the dynamite he was riding with the former rich sea has already died, but before, there were already a few meters away, and now, in the other region, you have no viand!
A community community is not progressive in number of the poor and squatters, the people of Navotas were able to find a lot of livelihood, but if it is still politics, the community and life in Navotas City will be solved.
