I caught in the mouth, "CAYETANO.

The former Senator Alan Peter Cayetano is busy with what Senator Alan Peter Cayetano is doing so that he will not accept Vice President Jojo Binay why he does not want to attend the Senate Blue Ribbon sub-committee.
According to Binay, he is judged by the said committee, especially Cayetano and his two companions, which is why it is definite that he will burn down and put the Office of the Vice-President if he agrees with the opposition of the opposition, "watercion."
We remember that Cayetano himself asked the defense of 2010 to the Nacionalista Party (NP) presidential candidate Manny Villar when he refused to face the Senate Committee of the Whole which was built to investigate the C-5 Road scandal.
Do you know what Cayetano said that they will ask the refusal of Villar that they are going to face the investigation on the streets, which is why there is a court, that is why there is a court, that is why there is a court, which is why there is a court, that is why there's no reason for Binay's reason? "Is it not?
It is just right for others to find justice if they think that they have a judge, but in the case of Cayetano, why is it acceptable for Villar, but when it came from Binay's reason, he could not accept it?
Is it not a temporary standard of justice, what is the justice for Binay if he will face the committee of Cayetano when they say that Binay is being threatened by the senators that they will just allow the anti-Binay?
Common-year-old senators, I mean, what you want to say is that it's only Villar who has the right to mind the investigation of the Senate wherein it's only Villar who has the right to look for justice for the supreme court instead of going to face the Senate?
Not only fishes were caught in the mouth, Cayetano also said.
