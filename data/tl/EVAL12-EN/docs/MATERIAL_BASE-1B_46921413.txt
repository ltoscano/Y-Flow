Hunger, it is difficult when it comes, pound, We: A result of corruption.

We are experiencing hyperacidity because of the cold season.
It is not easy to heat and sweating for our bad feelings.
This is where we remembered the condition of thousands of families in Zamboanga City who were victims of war and lost their homes.
We also remember the victims of typhoon Yolanda, including the victims of typhoon Sendog and Pablo.
Thousands have died until now, no home or good home, aside from being hungry and having a hard time.
That is why, what I feel is nothing compared to what they are crying.
What's painful to the victims of Yolanda, judicial system, and those who have grown up are increasing.
And now that the typhoon is here again, flood and storm surge caused by the Lupit of calamity.
And for sure there will be more months because of the severity of their experiences in death, a widower and orphaned, due to lack of livelihood and twin, no one knows where the path is going.
King-mother, judicial oy, while all of these are happening, they are addicted to corruption, corruption and politicking.
One of them does not have a deep time in order to visit the victims of calamity.
"It is good to monitor the impeachment of PNoy and just wash their hands.
The greedy Disbursement Acceleration Program is calling for someone to return as DAP.
But can we believe that there is no fund here and it is spent all.
And in good luck, they are living in the spending of their DAP, including 1.1 billion pesos that was given to the senators so that they will not be impeached, ex-Chief Justice Renato Corona.
Who will believe those who believe that this woman "in good intentions, and they have not even received a cent, they have not even received a cent from each other?

You here in Malacanang, you are very quick to spend or remove the items used by the people, like P177B DAP.
But until now, a mother-and-child stayed in the loss and future of the calamity in what you are doing.
