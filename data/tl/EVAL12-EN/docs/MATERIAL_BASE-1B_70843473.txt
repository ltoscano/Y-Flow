You will know.

One year has passed since the raging typhoon Yolanda hit Leyte and Samar.
And because since then, typhoon Yolanda was strong, which is why thousands of lives of our fellow countrymen have had a hole.
Aside from a hint of livelihood and economy in the affected areas.
Abaca of the Diocesan of Yolanda, due to its headache, also the politics in Tacloban, tsk, tsk, tsk!
Just think that at the height of calamity, instead of giving attention to the victims, they should have been prioritized by a monster with the desire to oust the mayor of the said place.
Yolanda is really, Yolanda!
When the help arrived from different parts of the world, instead of thanking these, there are times that those that are from the Customs have a chance to reach Customs.
Yolanda is really, Yolanda!
And after one year, although our fellow countrymen are trying to continue, they can clearly see that the victims of Abaca, Yolanda are still down.
Because he did not allow the help of the government, then even the billion peso aid from the international community is believed to be steal!
Yolanda is really, Yolanda!
There are even instances, to make a chance, that while many of our countrymen are waiting for help, on the other part of Tacloban, there is a assigned relief goods.
The damage caused by the victims is because he did not pay attention to the victims! King-mother!
And now, even the "Tacloban airport, who served as the refuge of many victims of Yolanda, was the one who was held by Yolanda.
So many have been declared and transferred to the neighboring town!
Instead of helping, it is better to put politicking.
Because the truth is, a huge number of Yolanda in our government!
