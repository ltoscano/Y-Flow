I am too horny.

The true colors of Senator Grace Poe is slowly coming out.
What she repeatedly saying is for him to be poor and will continue to have started against her father, Da King Fernando Poe Jr., it looks like Grace has already forgotten.
Grace is really being servile to President Aquino.
Grace also said that PNoy has already explained the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) when he spoke on television recently.
Grace has no evidence for defending PNoy!
He did not feel ashamed of the people.
Many are asking if Grace understood what PNoy said about the similarity of the people for DAP.
If examined carefully, PNoy really explained that PNoy is sensible about the funds of the country.
Did PNoy answer the questions if the DAP was legal?
And why is it that the DAP was put in power?
The problem with Grace, just speak with the media even if he has a failure, that is okay with him.
Where is Grace saying that she is for the poor?
It is clear that DAP is against the poor.
The sure who will benefit from DAP are the corrupt lawmakers and not the poor.
It is frustrating, Grace.
If he still has a shame left, he should stop defending PNoy.
He knows that DAP is also a kind of pork barrel but the defense of PNoy is still ongoing.
Grace should know that the reason why he won in the election is because of the people who love FPJ.
"He will not allow the memory of FPJ to not waste the memory of FPJ.
After being caught, it seems that Grace is like a foul smell?
Let us wait for the next chapter.
