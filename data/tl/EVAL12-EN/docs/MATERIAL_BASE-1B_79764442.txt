There is no reason.

In the speech of President Benigno Aquino III in Boston, Massachusetts, Monday, he said that former President Ferdinand Marcos and his allies could be likened to a crazy dog who does not have anyone in other countries and was killed in the Manila International Airport last 1983 but he was hit by the Marcos family.
For the citizens, what President Noynoy Aquino is doing is not right because it seems that he is using his position for personal interest or benefits that is why he is using his position to follow everything, including the Supreme Court with revenge with power?
That is why he really wanted for a period for extension, for him to fulfill his bad plan to take revenge on a crazy dog and has no idea, what can he do with his own pocket and his followers and poor people to be aware of it.
He should have done what he wants, for extension, if he can see and feel that the people still want him to happen to his knowledge, the people are already tired of the hunger, the people have lost their hunger, and the people who are poor are struggling and continue to suffer from poverty.
Only those KKK and picked up the money coming from the treasury of wealth of the country.
What he / she is saying to be in his pockets, "only to his pocket and the people around his ears, and the people near him are the people around him and not the people around him and not the people who have put PNoy in position.
Admit it or not by President Noynoy, he is not only at Genutives position but also to Senator Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos who did not refuse his request to bring him to their region to win.
In this moment, it seems that the current president can be compared to a crazy dog who has no reason because those who helped him like Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada and his party were not doing anything else or a law in the Minority Floor of the Congress.
