Holy Week, Hala BIDs.

For the devotees of christians, the only destination of the Heroes' Day is suffering, many will increase in churches for a Visita Iglesia or traveling to different provinces for spiritual knowledge to reflect.
Even though there are also some, in the modern times this season, those who are going to travel to the beach, the firing line that can be given a trend, no matter how normal roads are in the cities.
However, Filipinos are proud that the Holy Week is considered as a long vacation, a long vacation from free, a long vacation from free!
The sacrifice is common for many of us who lived in order to work and work to live.
In some provinces who are devastated by typhoon or too much drought, it can be said that it is a painful truth than a way to commemorate the pain and death of Jesus.
Isn't it possible that there will be no effect of the lashing and dirty roads of Metro Manila while it seems that it is not enough to reading the news about the burning of speeding buses?
These past few weeks, our ears almost makes our ears there in the consecutive wins of anomalies in the government and stealing from the country's funds and it is probably the reason why many of our christians choose to escape even just a short time and set aside our duties every Holy Week.
We probably believe that God will understand us, but it is still better if we try to be part of this ordinary day in the calendar of our good deeds for heaven.
