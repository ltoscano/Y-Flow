The captain and taxi drivers are stupid.

Lily's Calvento File are on the way of reading their complaints and complaints about their employers or places, but like before, we will not mention their names and cellphone number as well as their request and protection.
However, it will be denied that the PRETE is published, that is what's stated in the things that was sent by text message, and email to lily's Calvento Files, we will have no change or to share words.
Good thing, Miss lily said, those leaders of our barangay here in Quezon City are worthless, all of them, from the barangay captain until we have seen that we have seen a project that is why we have seen a project that is why our IOS and Internal Revenue (WBC) did not do anything.
It is already the election and a new year since there is no snake who fought against him because there is no one to fight him because we are afraid and second, we are supported by our barangay chairman? Thank you and IGAPAPP-0 pesos.
Lily's Calvento Files, the residents of your barangay voted for your captain, that if you do not want to run for six-years, why did you not notice that he did nothing within six-years, why did you not notice that he did not notice, you should also investigate.
It's a good day for me, not only tricycle drivers should be drug test but also the drivers of jeep, bus and taxi.
In my opinion, the drivers of passenger vehicles who are not using drugs should be counted before, most of the drivers use before you board the vehicle that they are driving at 0939: 8: 6 p.m.
Lily's Calvento: Well, think of it, and it is up to the public what their reaction will be.
