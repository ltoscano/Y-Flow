My happiness.

Those who are happy are the entire afternoon and the ability to choose the happy moments, there are moments and ability to return to sadness.

Happiness is not only for the success you received or being possessed today and any religion that you have used here.

Can it be mentioned in religion that live without violence, corruption, and not care, and we do not care that this is one of our families and friends?, and even to the knowledge of our families and friends?

To all those who want to connect with you and complete, it is still not enough to match what is happening in your life, sad, and all of these are still alive but you are still alive, you do not understand, and have hope.

Aside from this, there are still no other things that we need to keep sharp; instead of what would make us happy, instead of the common hobby that would make us happy, instead, the confusion of these two; hobby and happiness, is what our happiness is from.

Here is a story of a child seminarians.

One day, there is a child seminarians who asked the priest of the church, why did many people go down on the Bible, and most of them have to stop and quickly return to their respective cities.

Calm respond to the priest: "Last night, I noticed my pet dog that was seen to be seen in a rabbit of hiding and hiding him, while my dog was running, he had a lot of things.

Just a few more moments, the number of dogs that were used to go after the chase became the chase after they arrived at a rabbit and became the reason for a lot of dogs to join the chase and the peace of the night, which resulted in the chance to catch a rabbit.

And this heavy chase continued all night. "What happened in the chase happened," what really happened in the chase, "said the dog," said, "the dog," said to stop, "said the dog, who suddenly stopped and did not end a rabbit."

Now, do you have a rabbit in your life that you want to catch?
