Church in Lateries, Rome.

Ginger Thy Walis name of Father Edwards B. Liwag.

The land where the church is located is a Christian Roman Catholic priest that was given by the Likoy Rondiano, last November 9, year 324 to Papa Sylvertre I was also the Bishop of Rome before.
This is the house of the Pope to transfer to the house of the Pope to a Toyota Vios, after the construction of the Vatican from Rome, the Papa came back after the fifth anniversary of Jesus who is safe and from San Juan Bautista.
The reading on our celebration now is the statement of Eyebank Foundation, that he saw the water coming from the temple, all of those who came from the town of Christ, we have a good upbringing by God, and we are the christians in the town of Jesus.
Jesus is in the temple of our life that whatever happens, he will not be forsaken by him and to take care of our temple to respect and take care of our temple that takes good care of us.
Take care of our church through weekly celebration, that's why he's being maligned by other religion because we are being slandered by our column, just go home to our faith that you might just go to church every Sunday?
