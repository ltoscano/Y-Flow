The LP is weak?

Even if Malacanang does not admit, he directly admitted that the spokesperson of this from the Liberal Party which included Edwin Lacierda, Abigail Valte and Ricky Fangon, will break its wing.
This is what's happening now in the kingdom of PNoy that's why the people are thinking and wondering why the President did that he has made the international words from the LP while he is also a few hours in the field of communication.
Many are very thinking if the former highest officials of LP, Mar Roxas with PNoy are already weak because of the wings of Valte, Lacierda and it seems that the disappearance of the Liberal Party in the house of the country's power is already as well as the same age.
It looks like there is something that the citizens do not know about the Palace because this is a sign of change in mandate and trust of the spokesperson, and to give it to Secretary Hermann Coloma, who is well-known in the side of Samar group or "those in the office of Samar group or" those in the positions of Noynoy and Binay or Nogui last 2010, it is really surprising.
PNoy showed an ordinary anger for the change in the lead in Malacanang, which is why the possibility that the possibility that Roxas will not become a standard bearer in 2016 is getting worse.
PNoy probably already knows that he could not be defeated by Roxas because he has been given Kautism but it is still negative for the people.
In a short word, plan should rule the current situation and that is what we should monitor because for sure there will be a lot of events.
Who knows that maybe VP Jojo Binay is still the top of PNoy in 2016 to ensure that he will not be one of Gloria Arroyo, he says because he is his enemy to replace him in his throne.
