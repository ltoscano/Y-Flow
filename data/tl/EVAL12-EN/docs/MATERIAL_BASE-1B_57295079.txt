The numbers of BangCAAP?

On May 16 to May 17, the carelera (race of amca) there in Barangay Tagoloan, Batangas City was found, that this is the highlight of the year celebration in the said barangay.
Because the "exalera" became part of the celebration of their feast, different groups went to the said water drum.
And in many years this is being done, there is nothing wrong with nothing there, "like now, it's not good for him to be a good relationship with the" horseshoe. "
Because according to join in the gathering, until now, the winner is not yet received by the division.
Just imagine that, those who are studying are from Metro Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Mindoro and others from Boracay.
If there is something that should be blamed for the brook, well, there is no one else but Brgy.
The victims or those who take advantage were given time to make the residents of Barangay Malamig but what they hit?
It's because instead of accepting the winner in their reward from KimXi. Mendoza, their damage is bad - according to them - they are resentment.
And their complaint is, wow, they did not take care of - even if he was fed or asked to drink water, they said that their experiences were bad.
This complaint of "tanim-cars" will surely leave a negative impression, "not only to KimXi. Mendoza, but also to Mayor Eduardo Diangco.
Mayor Diangco is supposed to get involved in this issue due to the complaint of the "Ipit Gang" who won but the reward was not received.
Let's ask for an explanation, mayor, KimXi. Rudy Mendoza, because according to the report, the competition of "tanim-carera" which is used to ask for a reward to the businessmen there in Batangas is used.
Let us watch out for the action of the broken mayor for a mix of electricity and the winner of the previous "exalera" in Brgy. Bayabas, Batangas City.
