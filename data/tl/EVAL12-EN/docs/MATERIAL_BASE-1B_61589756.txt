Jojo Binay and S" Manny Villar.

Senator Manny Villar had made it once when he was a candidate for the President, despite the call of other senators to explain his involvement with his involvement with the anomaly C-5 Road extension, he remained silent for this issue.
The accusation against Villar, which is number 1 million for the presidency, is that he is given P200-million or double or Single Entry SEC in the budget for C5 Extension case in Las Piñas and Parañaque for C5 which will cross the South Expressway.
In Las Piñas, a lot of subdivisions was there and the land of Brother Mike Velarde's land was said to be both assigned for the land of the two of them.
Villar promised to explain why the C5 extension is severe, to favor him and his political ambition, Villar was forced to return to the Senate to defend himself.
But the case is, after his speech, he suddenly left the session hall and was not able to do anything to his fellow senators.
The rating of Villar fell and he was finally defeated by his candidacy.
This is also what was done by the former Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona who refused to face the Senate until he will be impeached.
In his trial in the Senate, Corona suddenly approached but he was stopped by the Senate security.
Up to now Binay does not want to face the Senate blue ribbon committee because she will just be forgiven by the senators in the blue ribbon committee.
Binay will also challenge the debate with Senator Antonio Trillanes but it seems that this will not happen because of the absence of his supporters to have a debate with Trillanes' EP / Raul VALNAs.
