Watch these.

Our attention was taken away yesterday because Manila Vice Mayor Isko Moreno's surface while speaking on television about what he is saying is President Joseph Estrada.
If Isko is an ordinary citizen who does not know anything about the "obscene position, we will understand.
But, it is one of the Lord, it is one of the saints when Isko really knows that the president is not a mayor and has no position of President mayor or President mayor.
If a lawyer can come out and have passed as a doctor, you can call as a doctor because he may serve as a lawyer and may also be given to the task of being a doctor.
But in the case of Erap, what he can do in these times is being a mayor and he might not be imprisoned as president!
"What's calling, is Isko's call for Mayor Erap to be an expert in his final term as president, well, he can call it as a president," or "ex-President."
I repeat, to make sure that if we are talking about it, ignorance and lack of knowledge about the position are not the same with Isko as if they seem to be dumb among the call of Erap by President mayor.
But the possible cause of this is it is clear that Isko will just laugh at Erap so that Mayor Estrada will just laugh at the shadow of yesterday, "he still said!
In short, if Isko will be cooked, it can be said that Erap will be said to be cooked, so if I will call you Mayor Erap, the one who will call you by President mayor will run away immediately!
Because you will just be cooked by people!
Just a moment, make sure that before you get married, you are children of jueteng, well, solve the widespread crimes now in Manila!
King-mother!
