It was just a trailer of the movie General Luna, I made sure that I can watch this again and I think she's very beautiful, and I think she can be considered as a masterpiece by Director Jerrick and Tarzan.
Aside from being a hero, John Luna as General Luna, one of the actor I admire here is Mon Conejero who will be elected as President Emilio Aguinaldo.
When I became prudent, I had a conversation with him in this movie that will be shown this Wednesday, SSeptember 9.
"What I did for General Luna as President Aguinaldo.
"And when I got the message and sent the script of four-month-old man, I was able to make a lot of movies in the history of the Philippines, which was why I fell down and committed suicide) and the Lalaurie of Danial Day-Lewis before.
He added that, "I also went to the house of Aguinaldo at Kawit, and she got a hidden talent in the books, Philipines, I worked hard for me to go out at the age of 78.
"What can she say to Director Jerrick Mojica and of the protagonist John Jerrick Mojica, very simple, but he should not be seen as a villain in the film, but she also wants me to play a hero or being a hero, she also wants me to play in the process of the delegation of Pres. Emilio Aguinaldo.
"John Arcilla is one of the actors of the Philippines because she is very proud of her, it's very good for me to live with the actors like him, General Antonio Luna, and no one else!"
Mon also said why Filipinos should watch General Luna, "it needs to be watched by Filipinos by General Luna because this film needs to be watched, and hopefully, will have a lesson and open their minds, especially during election."
