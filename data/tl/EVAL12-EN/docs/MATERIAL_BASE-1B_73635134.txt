When would he resign.

For now, Al Vitangcol was unable to resign, General Manager of Metro Rail Transit because his name needs to be clean before he resign.
"Who will really be annoyed by his name?" All the flawless body, "said Al.
What if his name is not clean?, "he would not resign.
It's as if there is no idea, right?
And who would be his own body?
Of course, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) today is currently investigating the allegations that Al is preparing for Al-Human Rights Group of Czech Republic for the amount of $30 million in exchange of the contract in MRT.
Who else will investigate? Of course, Joseph Emilio Abaya, secretary of the Department of Transportation and Communications.
Is there a secret that is why we will know this case?
Just recently, Abaya launched an investigation about the entry of Virginia Torres, chief of Land Transportation Office (LTO) in a casino, which is why Abaya is investigating.
It seems that the investigation is too secret so nobody was able to know what happened to the case but later on, Torres has resigned without a case presented to him.
Abaya is also the investigation of Vitangcol's case, but the investigation is slow, why?
The Palace of President Noynoy has its own investigation, but before the case will be started, the palace is already preparing for Vitangcol.
Abaya and Vitangcol was both pillars of the Liberal Party which is President Noynoy.
Are we taking sides in this case?
Meanwhile, the line in MRT is getting hotter, the wagons, which are often destroyed, are not working as well as the escalator.
"You will just buy a bus if you do not want to lined up in a long time," Malacanang said, I will ask "I am sorry."
