Exchange of praises.

Press row of Abac Cordero.

Thousands have been able to watch the video of Floyd Mayweather Jr, who was slapped on the face of a det-in-law that should have been used by Manny Pacquiao.
Mayweather himself posted the video on the internet.
Mayweather showed here that he is facing a low-shaped like a person and is favorite to use the training of human rights or other athletes.
Mayweather imagined that Pacquiao is leading.
Some are laughing at the background while Mayweather is talking and seems to be angry why Pacquiao used the cause of his loss to defeat.
Mayweather almost can handle the ears of his ear because she cannot even hear her answer.

And she suddenly got slapped on the face.
Two strong slaps and saying, "stop!"
I watched the video twice.
It is not funny even if Mayweather said that he is just having fun and this is a joke in the video, you can see the true color of the boxer.
Naturally, Pacquiao has watched the video.
But instead of getting angry, Pacquiao allowed the people to understand Mayweather because of his personality.
"" We should understand people like that so we can't get angry, "Pacquiao said.
"If you get mad at him, it's as if you are just taking care of him / her, because we understand him.
Pacquiao and Coyo, are like that.
So if you can see the video, it is sure that Mayweather is already scattered on YouTube that's why it's just going to show Mayweather.
Pacquiao said, do not pay attention to that.
It's just a woman.
