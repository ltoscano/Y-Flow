The opening of classes in public school last Monday, thank you to the Philippine National Police (PNP) because there is a proper conflict and taking advantage of it, this is also like the opening of classes on Monday to private schools.
What's not good that happened last Monday is that the students are still experiencing the lack of classrooms and not just one classroom, there are also lack of chairs and even schools in the province that students need to bring their own chair.
This problem might not be gone every time the classes start, that is why there are only 127 years old and the students who are crowding in the room and are being forced to endure their schooling.
After a few days before the school year, Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Argie Luistro also assured that there is no lack of violence which will not happen again.
But Luistro also made a mistake in the statement because there is still lack of lack.
It turns out that ACT party-list Representative Antonio Tinio can say that there is a lack of 67,849 in the whole country, and according to Tinio, 7,062 people have ended, which is why Tinio is right, which is still lacking.
