Why is it so?

Why is it so?

(Jony.

15: 18 to 31)

Why is there a lot of anger and passion in the Catholic Church?

Just recently, there is a survey released that those who are going to go to the public will be reduced because aside from the issue on the RH Law, and there is a survey that we can believe or not believe, this is good in our minds.

In Belgium, Archbishop Andre Paras, Leonard stressed that it shows a church regarding a text message and shouted, he poured water with his naked women while in an forum that's why he did not respect the old man, why did they not respect the old man?

In good news trends today by Jesus, "but it is not equal to you the world because you are not from the world but I will capture you from the world."

We will understand this part when San Juan was written if we will go back to the situation of their community during that time.

Many are angry with the christians because they are worried that he is worshiped by the lord for the leadership of Cesar, but the Lord is the only reason why many of the first christians have become a martyr anymore because of his stand in faith.

In this time, it is also good to be a guide of the will of God who should always be followed by many, not the feelings of many in power.

Why is it that because Christ's words are not fulfilling the world, what is important is that we follow Christ.
