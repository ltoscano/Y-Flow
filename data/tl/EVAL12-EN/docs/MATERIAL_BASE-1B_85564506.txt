Charge for garbage.

It is an issue that price of garbage will increase in Quezon City, Mayor Herbert Bautista is on the radio last day to answer the many questions about this.
The QC police is serious with their management, therefore, it seems that the additional fund is really needed, and of course, many have added that many jobs are said to have been paid to buy garbage that is why they are asking for additional payment to the residents.
The medical management is not a joke, there are a lot of issues like the Landfill management, of-years, of lack of garbage - the health of the residents, to the health of the city and the protection of nature.
That's why, Chance should be given the leader of the local government if they will change the rules, which now has a corresponding expenses, in fixing garbage and trust is what a leader needs, from his jurisdiction.
Corruption has been the issue for a long time so if there are suggestions to add bills, the people will immediately complain, perhaps because of the additional expense but to the doubt that the government is asking for the additional money that the government is asking for.
And Mayor Bautista is brave to face the camera in a program on radio and TV to answer the questions of the garbage issue of the QC.
But it is exposed that the mayor explained the additional change and asking for the cooperation of many.
In the end, the result of the work of our elected leaders will be the basis and determine if the additional increase is appropriate for the department management in QC.
In my opinion, the country is an ally of the government if good and honest service is the discussion.
