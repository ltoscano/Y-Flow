Going crazy!

"When there is a ceasefire, you will take a nail if you stay silent, take it back and do not want to go home."
This was pointed by Atty. Deor Grafil, head of OFW Conro to lead the office of Vice President Jejomar Binay.
Even in Bantay, meow, the names have submitted to our Overseas Filipino Workers in Libya where their names will be implemented so that they can go back to the country.
He said that they cannot call our Philippine Embassy there.
Grafil will immediately coordinate with Charge "de Affairs Adel Cruz of Rapid Mankayan, Team of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Libya to inform the list of our OFWs.
While Cruz will call one of the OFWs in the list but what is saddening, they are going back and forth.
According to him, they will not go home because they feel, it seems that the conflict will not stop and it seems that it will not last long.
It's a waste if they will go home, for sure they will only be hungry for the Philippines.
With what Cruz wants, that more of our countrymen are going home, he is trying to convince their fellow OFWs to convince their colleagues to take advantage of the program's program while there is a help coming.
Tripoli wants to be closed that is why through Land Transportation or trip to the ocean, he might be used to reach the nearest country such as Malta and there, they can ride a airplane going home to the Philippines.
The government rented a ship for a huge amount.
And from leasing out of Philippine Airlines, he will go home to our OFWs.
Hopefully our fellow citizens should not ignore the passing of our officials for the sake of their safety.
Labor Secretary Rosalinda Balentz assured that he is on alert with the approval of the Department of Labor Law so that the needs of the OFWs from the airport are quick to answer to the needs of the OFWs from the airport, it is the opposite of the landing of the airplane they were riding.
