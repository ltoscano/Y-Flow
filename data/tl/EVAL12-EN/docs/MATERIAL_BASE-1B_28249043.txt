Join the Christmas season (S.MG): Reflection of the 3rd day of Advincula-year-15, 2013.

Nine out of sleep and Christmas, are you going to be happy, most of us are going to be happy and thoughtful, "what I am waiting for is that you are going to be happy and thoughtful," that is what we are waiting for us to celebrate Christmas, "that is what we are waiting for us to celebrate Christmas," that is what we are waiting for us to celebrate Christmas, "that is what we are waiting for to celebrate Christmas," that is what we are waiting for us to celebrate Christmas! "That is what we are waiting for us to celebrate Christmas!" That is what we are waiting for us to celebrate Christmas!
