On the middle of the Philippine Daily Inquirer's released news, March 21, 2012), Deputy Presidential spokesperson Abigail Valte said that the proposed wage increase in the salary of the workers will be bigger, which is why the salary of the workers will be used to help to dry up to dry up to dry up to dry it.

This 2012, ng Wage of worker has P426 pesos in NCR, which is why the value of the increase in 2005 and the value of the hour of 2005 and the value of twenty pesos (P4.8 billion worth of 2000) is higher, which is why the value of the proposed bill will be higher.

It is just perfect for the workers to stop the increase in the Congress of the Congress now, even the Senate and Executive, who are all coming from the age of 2013, and if they want to vote for the workers from Barangay, Congress and Senate this way, it might be allowed to vote for the workers from Barangay, congress and Senate.
