Marcos is approaching our country.
Bira Masukat, August 15, 2016.
If the victims were just quiet and did not ask for the burial of former President Ferdinand Marcos in the Libingan ng mga Bayani, we do not have an issue on the Libingan ng mga Bayani.
Because there is no issue about the issue about it, the officials of our government will be able to show up, especially the government officials who will bring benefits to each Filipino people not like the burial of FM at the Libingan ng mga Bayani.
Well, the number of times and time of the politicians are wasted, especially the lawmakers that are on the issue of the burial of FM at the Libingan ng mga Bayani.

Instead of using the lawmakers and other politicians to use their time in discussion on the issues near the intestines of every Filipino people, it is given attention by the issue on the burial of Marcos in the Libingan ng mga Bayani.
For me, now that the country is seeing that the country is already seeing the issue on the burial of the former President, they should go back down because it is hard for President Rodrigo Duterte to break his promise to the people especially that he admitted that he is only one of Ilocos Governor Imee Marcos to the two governor who supported him during the campaign period.
But if they can see that President Duterte was seeing that they were taken to the recently concluded elections, they should voluntarily back down because the body of Marcos in Ilocos was good.
The tourism and we know that the contribution here in the presence of FM in Ilocos is huge.
That's why in this aspect, we should just look at the events because many are against the burial of Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani due to many reasons.
For me, this time the orphaned of Marcos will sacrifice because despite the many mistakes of Marcos in the country, they still recognize their clan in our society aside from being given a chance to be elected again in different positions in our government.
