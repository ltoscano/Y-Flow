The negligent politicians are dangerous.
BE with Dacer-September 2, 2016.
The days are all negligent and abusive officials scattered in different parts of the world.
This is with the reopening of the investigation by the Department of Labor Law Compliance (Dalig) of the two Labor laws that will be in Saudi Arabia who are SPO 2 Neil dela Fuente, Labor Law.
The two testified for the condition of overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) in the countries they are heading to where many were arrested because of the lack of documents, which is why some of them were arrested because of the lack of documents, which is why the two officials were also charged.
This case should serve as a lesson to all Labor laws and their personnel to be responsible for whatever obligation is set on you.
For your information, you are assigned there in any corner of the world to take care of our countrymen who are working hard.
Maybe you are not assigned there in order to have a life.
But hopefully the COMELEC (DOLE considers the performance of our Labor officials in different parts of the world to get fired from those who are negligent.
It's a waste for the government of Duterte to fix the situation of our OFWs if there are only remaining unruly officials who in our news, instead of giving service to the OFWs they are going to serve.
But it is also better if the DOLE and the President should just consider them to remove all the elected Labor laws.
Because if you are sensible, I can be sure that the President will get more better if it comes to the taste of his leadership.
