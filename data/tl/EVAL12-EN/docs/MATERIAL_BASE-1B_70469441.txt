No miracle.

There was no attempted cheating that happened on the cave which was led by PBA commissioner Chito Salomens last Thursday for the next drafting.
There is no cheating that has no anomaly.
This was insisted by Salominations are insisted after Rain or Shine coach Yugoslavia was criticized to find out who was going to find out who will be owned by Number 1 pick on the next hornets.
Use the ball that Salazine and Meralco were covered in the peak when he placed it in a box.
GlobalPort against hornets, but what happened is a bit painful.
First, the box is not transparent, so when they put the ball, the public cannot see what is made inside the box.

Second, when the commissioner put the last ball, she did not release her hand to show that he is not holding anything.
It is normal to be done in a hurry to show that there is no cheating that will happen.
Even if his hand is increasing, his hand is increasing before he pulled out the pigeons since he was able to think Guiao and the public that Salazza knows about the ball she is about to pull.
That is if there is a cheating that happened.
But I believe in commissioner when he said that it was very clean even if he admitted that their process is not complicated, that is why it is possible doubting.
They are not a job of Salazza to judge or any ball.
Just in the next time to fix the process, do not allow the commissioner to take out and use transparency in or destroy it.
Where are you able to convince that you cannot see what is inside?
Salominations are worried about what happened, that is why the controversy will not happen again.
There is no miracle in the PBA.
