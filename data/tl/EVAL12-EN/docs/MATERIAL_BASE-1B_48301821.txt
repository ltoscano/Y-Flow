Here is a song when I am still in elementary, in the encounter and an addition.

In desire to remove the iron fist, the steel shoes has gone.

In expressing the steel shoes, the horse is able to get away.

In expressing the horse, he got irritated and fell.

In order to board, an important warning was not given.

In order to make it up to the war, he lost my kingdom.

In order to recover, it will be more buried more.
