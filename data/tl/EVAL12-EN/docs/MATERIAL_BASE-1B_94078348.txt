In relation to the ongoing exchange of the accusation between Commander of the United Nations Security Forces, and the Philippine Contingent in Golan Heights, about the not surrender of weapons from the latter of those who tried to sell drugs, we thought of a law.
If there is an accident or an international law and local laws, we should stop the local.
Of course, someone will argue about it.
But if I am the government of the Philippines, make sure that the Filipinos do not have the right to give weapons and fight until last.
The Commander of UN said they are coward and professionals for their not surrender of weapons, fight against the rebels who attacked them and escape and abandonment of their positions in the end.
Filipinos were allegedly put under the danger of the lives of Moro Islamic Freedom Fighters, who was first attacked by the rebels who were imprisoned until now by the rebels.

Just like what we are saying earlier, the national interest of the Philippines should prevail in time that there is no need for a law to travel to our law.
One more thing, it is even released by the weapons force of the weapons to show the world that they should not waste who are armed in the area they are monitoring and to implement their tasks with the whole strength.
The escape is not cowardice but part of a tactic to prevent the more strong opponent.
King-mother, what can the 71-Remontadoses do with the attack of thousands of forces of the opponent?
If the UN will show weakness in front of threats and threats of those who destroy peace and good relationships of the countries in each other, what can it be?
Philippine Contingent, we are giving up all over RTEL. Jun Briones.
