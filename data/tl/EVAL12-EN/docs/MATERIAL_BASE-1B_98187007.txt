Busy.

Busy (Lk. 10: 38) are you busy in many things in your life?

There is one story about the two farmers who are Juan and Pedro who ordered to milk the rice harvest and they agreed that they will harvest the same time when Juan went up and went under a tree after a few minutes and went back to the harvest.

After a few hours, Juan went back under the tree and after a few minutes he went back to work, but when I went to work for many times, so when I went to work, it seems that all of us are busy in work, but I still have a lot of work, that is why I still want to get along with him / her so many times, so I still want to get along with him / her.

He is already tired, he complained to Jesus to tell Maria to help him in preparation, but Jesus has a warning to us.

No matter how much we are busy in our lives, we need to sit in front of Jesus, we need to listen to the bathroom of Jesus, we need to listen to the comfort room so that we need to listen to the table of our body, we need to listen to the dining table so that we need to listen to the table of our body, we need to listen to the dining table so that we need to listen to the dining table so that we need to listen to the dining table in order to listen to the comfort room.
