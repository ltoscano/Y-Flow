Love and admiration.

It is better to love and fail, instead not to love again.

Do you love my love?

It will be noticed that the people involved in successful are very popular, and recognized, but this does not mean that we love them, just like the love that we have done to our families, as long as we have the ability to help them, if we will just help us, and not continue to be amazed.

My admiration, if it goes on and the deeper, this is one of their idol, and I feel that if I am being jealous of what I admire you, I feel that when I admire my jealousy, I feel that when I admire a person, I feel that I am also a healthy feeling that's also similar to me.
