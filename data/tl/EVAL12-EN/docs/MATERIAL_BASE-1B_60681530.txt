BE is hot-tempered in August 18, 2016, in the September of September, he will be able to go back in playing Slaughter.
He admitted that he is very eager to play and want to help in the campaign of Ginebra.
But he can't do anything and he can't send the doctor's order to send a text message that his contract on Ginebra, and we are sure that there is something happening with the negotiation.
Hopefully, the fans of fans are hoping that he will stay here in Ginebra.
It depends on course if they will reconcile with the new contract of Greg.
But Ginebra, I think, he will not release SMC group.
If ever it is not, I am also sure that the MVP is just waiting for a player, who is at a caliber of Greg.
One team will return to their former name in the next conference of the PBA.

Is it really disturbing?
