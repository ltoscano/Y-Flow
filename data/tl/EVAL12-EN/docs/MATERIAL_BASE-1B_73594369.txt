Program ALS, my help in Pag-3618.

It was only seven years old and it was only five years old but it can be seen on her intelligence and ability to do the things that he might learn from the right use of computers and even the things that he could learn.

We can only give in to his right education for her life to improve which is the only wish of our parents.

The grim accident happened this month of June 08, 2012, together with the elderly, who have already married, which also passed the examination examination.

Because he passed the ALS, he did not need to pass through the New Year high school since he was graduating and this is a proof that he graduated from High School.

That is why in the school year, his classmates were sad because he was not in their group for high school and a new challenge that he entered from college.

Together with his teacher.

At the age of 17, he will finish his course in computer technology for the preparation of a fervent prayer.

Thank you to his teacher who chose him to take a research to take a chance to pass. If not because of his teacher, maybe he will remain in the fourth year in High School.
