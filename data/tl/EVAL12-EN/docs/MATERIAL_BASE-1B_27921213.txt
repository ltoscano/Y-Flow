The next vice president.

Many of our countrymen are focusing on the debate between Vice President Joe Biden and Congressman Paul Ryan, to some of you who are not yet identified as vice president in America now and Congressman Paul Ryan, who will challenge him in the coming election in the United States of America for the next month of November.
Many of the audience of the debate on the past few days had comments about it, someone said that it was really different from someone who had a bad experience compared to someone who said that Ryan almost cried, with a veteran actress Paul Ryan, who said that the young lady, Paul Ryan, was able to escape.
Lola Biden said, Ryan could not answer the questions in the debate and he did not have explained the point of his point.
To the audience, it cannot be avoided that the two candidates for the Vice President, the high level of their knowledge in all issues, the strength of confidence of self from the point, is admirable as a professionals and protect the dignity.
There is even someone who said that she is even helped to improve the reputation of Barrack Obama, the candidate for the vice-President for their second term as well as the candidate who won the presidency, but the Vice-President will not allow the President to sit in his position.
Unlike us that the votes of the President are different and the votes of his Vice-President are different, maybe if he is not getting along well with his Vice-President, it might be good if he gets along with his Vice President and Vice, the cooperation is more intense, the cooperation is greater.
In America, whatever is the situation of Ryan and Ryan, the win of their candidate for the president is still not good that what I can say is that it's not good that the president and Vice President should not have a check-up so that the new politicians in the Philippines should have nothing to do with it.
