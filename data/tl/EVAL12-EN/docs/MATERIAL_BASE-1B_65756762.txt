CAB will be fine, the victims of crime.

Malaca√±ang insists on what he did to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, this is a sign of real peace in Mindanao?
Do you know the threats of the BIFF of the Abu Sayyaf Group?
I am happy with CAB but I am expected to reach peace in Mindanao but their signature is not enough if they can reach it with other forces like the BIFF and ASG, hopefully you can reach it to say that the nutrients of the CAB will be complete.
And now that it is fine, how will the lives of those affected by the typhoon and calamity?

It cannot be avoided for the issue of election 2016 and the Bangsamoro will seem to be the capital of the administration of Noynoy Aquino but it is not enough.
Look at the surroundings of the country, more suffering and hunger and no work, because of the additional gathering, the problem will increase because you do not have a project even if you do not have a project.
And aside from this, PDAF under Aquino is exposed under Aquino's complaint about the complaint of their contractor who is local and foreigners with the extreme spite of your personnel, Mister Aquino.
Where are they getting the thickness of their face, Mister President?
