This case is deacing or Wang Fam!

Postanes and his mind.
On June 9, 2015.
In opinion.

The Bureau of Immigration (BI) was already in the middle of the controversy when they revealed that their corresponding order to the fugitive from China, Wang Bo in exchange for P540 million, and attempted to be released.
If this is true, the case was held at Bo or Wang Fam due to a huge amount of bribe to be released from the suspect.
Wang was arrested when he arrived in the country last February because his passports and in an Hacadist of the BI has cancelled the release of the order last May 21, 2015, because of Commissioner Fred Mison, Associate Commissioners Al Qaeda, Associate Commissioners Al Argosino and Gilbert Sanchez.
Meanwhile, Wang wasn't able to release the BI because the Chinese embassy protested because Justice Secretary Leila de Lima has cancelled the said release of the Congress.
De Lima should also investigate this for how they could not disregard the $100-million case of Heide in his own country?
Now, everyone has mud at the leading Commissioners of Immigration.
The BI commissioners, Shanafred Mison, said that because of the release of another Chinese national who came back to the Philippines after being expulsion.
The House of Representatives also sympathized with the controversy.
The news broke out that 100 million from the payola went to Immigration and P440 million is for 292 congressmen to pass the Bangsamoro Basic Law.
The House should not neglect the new issue that the integrity of their institution is not a joke that is said to have been given the administration for bribes to approve the BBL.
