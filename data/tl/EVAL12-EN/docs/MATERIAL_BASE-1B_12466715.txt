Don Ramon was gambling in the QC and rotten NFA.

While the Filipinos are suffering, most of them are almost "one" one, one Eand "only, the tons of rice that will hook in Quezon City are the tons of rice that will be exported in Quezon City.
It would be better if it would like to make it look like it, these are "obsequiousness" of PNoy that a lot of grace should be wasted because of the benefit of the poor.
One thing is clear to us that is why he has not been given to our poor countrymen.
Because the said I was bought in the time of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Maybe they might think that there are rice that were given for free and imported at the time of GMA, while the imported NFA rice here in the time of PNoy will increase!
In the said warehouse of NFA, if you walk, you can say that the road will be guarded! "
So, what is the right way, if there is a gathering?
And what is no corruption, is that the many poor are clearly seen!
"That, make sure that the problem with our government is just for not to become a kind of past or not, the many grace should not be wasted, so that the poor can still be used for it!
I hope, you really love the president, just give you to the places where you have a picture of you or your name.
"It's better for us to cheat on who is really the one who bought the I, Rice," as long as the poor are waiting for it!
Entice the President.
The illegal gambling of Don Ramon in Quezon City has started again.
He is allegedly proud for the sake of Jun Carine ana, Doctor Jun Alico, "they won't be moved from Quezon City because they have already complete their grip to the office of QCPD Chief, General Mario dela Vega, to the PNP Regional Office in Bicutan, Taguig.
It is really okay, isn't it?
Entice the President.
