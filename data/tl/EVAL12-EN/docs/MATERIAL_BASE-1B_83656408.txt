You can accept.

The members of the said "third sex" in California at America last week passed because the law has passed there which allowed men to get married to men and women in the woman.
In the content of the newspapers, news published by lovers "couples" and both men who are happy to each other, kissed and celebrated.
Last month, the result of a survey is reported that many of the Filipinos are in favor and accepted by gay and tomboy.
But many of us do not agree with the new bruises of the law in California.
The controversy of the sex marriage was really intense.
In America, not all of the States are allowed to get married to both men.
Especially here, the influence of the Catholic Church is strong, which is strict against the said marriage.
Let us go back to the result of the survey which is saying that the gay and tomboy are okay with the Filipino, that they have accepted in society.
But do we accept them if many of the Filipinos are not in favor of their sex marriage?
Let us see the issue on the point of rights.
In America, those in favor of the sex marriage are fighting for the rights of the members of the third sex.
Many of them have a lot of material possessions and they need to protect if their loved ones are similar to them.
Here in us, there are a lot of gay and tomboy who are being abused by their lives.
When he was robbed, he was able to get hurt and hurt.
But they can't file a lawsuit against their partner because there is no law who protects there.
Now in California, Protected Areza has given birth to those who have sex.
They can get married, for each of them to pay for protection against the abuse and cheating, they can plan to have a long-time term.
Is the Filipino ready to give the rights to the third sex group like those with America?
