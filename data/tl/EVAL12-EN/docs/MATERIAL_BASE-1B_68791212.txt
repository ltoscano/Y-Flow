Sevidal is green.

It seems that the current administration is just choosing their suspension or case related to the pork barrel.
This is what we see and noticed because aside from Senator Jinggoy Estrada, Juan Ponce Enrile and Bong Revilla, who are all members of the opposition, it seems that the campaign against corruption of the Department of Justice is being focused on the election or not for the enemies of the administration.
It is clear in the statement of Justice Sec. Leila de Lima that he is not able to focus on the 3rd floor of the accused, something that is really surprising because it is clear in his statement during the beginning that he will use the crook in the government.
If our information is right, some of the lawmakers who are included in the 3rd Infantry Battalion who are involved are Senator Gringo Honasan, TESDA boss Secretary Joel Villanueva, Cagayan de Oro representative Victor Ortega and Ezers-list Representative Consignation!
Aside from De Lima's not priority, he is clearly using PDAF cases in his candidacy in senate, something that Estrada insisted.
As of now, the three senators remained surprised with the administration of the PNoy administration because they know that it was only three victims of the DOJ, Estrada and Revilla, that was why it was clear that PNoy had the command of the government and many of them are his allies.

The campaign of PNoy is over with the corrupt government.
Because it is possible that when they have opened and lost in 2016, they will be happy with what they did to CGMA that they insisted and imprisoned for a few years.
The PDAF and DAP will decrease PNoy, that is why he needs to work hard on his chicken in 2016, especially since Mar Roxas is not so much more strength that is said to be brought by the LP.
