Just leave!

On this day, you should stop and forget about what you are doing now, why do you want it to be done, and if you want it to happen, it is up to you and it is up to your life that seems to just leave.

This kind of view is, "one race," most of the people who are directly living in pretenses who continue to accept their situation or is being blind to the truth near them.

Until you depend on your fate like before - just finish, surrender and lose hope that their dreams will come true today.

Let us ask myself: Look at what you are doing now, is this what you really want?

Do you continue to support the pretenses that seem to be good for you, while in the depths of your heart, you are looking for the fulfilment of all your dreams for you?

Do not escape such as others, who are trying to take care of the events and truth that the people who are fond of eating, alcohol, gambling, rumors, and those who have no meaning to progress, poverty, poverty, and rational thinking will be felt.

Good deed is not a result of bad luck; however, the bad deeds, are all lonely and very pitiful.

Are you still going to wait after everything, before you act on your dreams, you will be able to leave and remain short of many things?

Here is the thing where you will surely lose the world, in his continuing love, the future is already forgotten and forgotten, but now that the change you see is happening, the future you are waiting for will change, together with the positive opportunities in the world.

What is needed is for you to be ready and full of vitality to face it with hope, strong, and beautiful and good for you to be yours without doubt.

You were born original and apart from everything, do not allow yourself to be dead as a copy of you and you will be allowed to bury your music while you still have a breath.
