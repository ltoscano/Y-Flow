Witnesses: Persist back.
June 25, 2016 with all the officials of the Philippine Sports Commission, Butch Ramirez will be the most successful.
In 2005, when it was done in Southeast Asian Games, we were recognized as vice champion, the first step on where the Philippines was leading the medal, which was when we first joined the said game in the '70s.
For those who have forgotten, the winner of Athola of the year of the year "that was no other than the athleen of the Filipino.

I remember this because I was the president of the Philippine Sess of making decisions that I was not surprised when Ramirez will comeback as chairman of PSC, who else was the one responsible for the said position but his mother, Persist back, as they say.
For those who do not know, Ramirez is included in the campaign of President-elect Rodrigo Duterte in the places where Davao City mayor will become campaigning, not easy to fix the campaign for the campaign to be successful.
Because Ramirez is skillful in handling the people, everything became fine.
What I am expecting is that Ramirez will be given a different position because the PSC will be held with a different position but maybe his return to the PSC is really written on the stars.
What can we rely on if Ramirez is seated in PSC again, aside from going near the kitchen of Malaca√±ang?
It is expected that many are expecting that, and even the leader of the PSC chairman and the president of the Philippine Eagle Committee is the improvement of sports in the leadership of Ramirez, it is hard to do but it can be done.
Will the plans of PSC and BOC C have to push through with having a new training center for filipino athletes?, why not, nothing is impossible.

And what is waiting for the National Sports Complex which is just waiting for the support that comes from the PSC? Sonny Angara, let us wait for what Ramirez will say about that.
The only thing I can say is that Ramirez wants to talk about the PSC.
Damayang Lagi, chairman!
