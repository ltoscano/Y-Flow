Baron and Kiko, perfect!
(Seal with A Kautism, that is it! By Alwin, August 17, 2016.
Thank you, thank you, for a love, he / she was very fond of gratitude, and I can accept and hug her Times Square.
But when I saw Baron Geisler and Kiko Matos, I don't know what my reaction should be.
Marias well, because they were in the same age, there was a possibility that he will drink alcohol and drilling the episode, that's why this happened, this is the result?
Oh no, will the demand for diets for market, which is the protagonist is Men banc?
Being treated?
Even if Ari'll be in a case, they really want to end up with a glimpse of their "supermoon" by Seal-A Kathleen (perfect), the sales of the world upside down, which is why the sales from the municipal hall will surely be erased when we sympathize with us.
Madela?
It's because it is said that Two people are from New York. We-an Sebum, a gay indie films or human beings work.
Chance may lead to the two of a 50-year-old movie?
Celebrate?
Because, Kiko said that Baron was ill-tempered and not just a handshake with what he needs to do so that the misunderstanding with Men will be fixed.
When the two men fought, they have made peace and burns.
"Are you happy and happy?" That is an example of the real Men that can be given to their idol and grandchild.
It is not an issue for them to have burns because they are both nuns but are not rude.
Now it is the all sorts of Bin Verona, which is also for the sake of the broers of Geisler and Matos?
Will the Pambansang Kamao of the campaign real Men banc?
Or up to that, they are really doing the two men to do everything to talk about?
