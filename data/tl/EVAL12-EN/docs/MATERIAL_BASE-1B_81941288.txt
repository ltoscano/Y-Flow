"Because I am really not working with music," I did not become a "attribute" to me the show, but I visited me to observe.
I think, what I feel is similar to others because the concert has been starting at night but the person is just fooling us.
But with what was amazed, after the first and a few seconds of music, the person suddenly came out and full of front of the City Hall.
Why is it so bad to pass this place, this is because of the jokes of Malabon Emergency Shelter Assistance (Commercial Center of 2013.
From being a fluster of music, I think that her lover will become an instant because of the band.
Applauded the audience favorite for each other to be entertained by the different kinds of sweet Christmas gift, buprofen, Pop, OPM, and monggo.
It is almost two hours for the Malabon Symposium (MSB) 2013, but she left a smile on talking to pray.
At dawn, however, I still did not visit sleepy, "because I could not beat my mind the concert I witnessed.
It's as if I want to repeat what I have heard from the songs of MSB, who have been said to have a debt from me even just a few hours.
