Public service came from the country.

Congressman Roman T. Romulo has shown a lot of opportunities for every Filipino.
In his service to the country, if we will come from our ancestors, we will no longer break the service of the country is in the system of their lives.
As a representative of the municipal hall of Pasig City, Congressman Roman T. Romulo has a symbol of a father who's in love, he takes good care and will do everything to help and improve the lives of his constituents.
Just recently he was headed by a Medical and dental head, which was allocated for the good of his countrymen in Rosario, Pasig.
He is the one who appealed and asked for help through compromises of Doctor James G. Dy and their companions, who are from Chinese General Hospital and Medical Center, to fulfill a big medical mission that can help in the need for financial ability.
There is a free consultation, giving free medicine, free mirror in the eyes, there will be free dental services and guidance regarding the proper medical services given to the citizens, especially to the poor who have no ability to treat themselves due to poverty.
In times like this, even if their district has been tested, the goal and objective of Cong. Roman Romulo has been tested for their good life and needs to be accompanied by Cong. Romulo has been together in giving love and concern for the people that they give importance to.
I would like to greet Dr. James Dy, Robert Yang, Steve Dy, doctors, dentist and medical mission of the Philippine Chinese it (PCCO) and Chinese General Hospital and Medical Center.
