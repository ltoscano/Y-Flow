I am still not sleeping and my lungs will not stop in tears because of a few days of phlegm in my lungs after a few days of excessive spending, here is where my lungs will come from and taking advantage of my temple.
I am thinking, this kind of limitation is how big compared to the experience of the family of the murdered in Maguindanao three years ago, in the same day, on the same day, it is not in the sea of tears, cold and sweat coming back to the image of the Black Nazarene, that is on the way back and returning to the image and reality.
I am thinking: There are also those who take advantage of them on that day, and what they were able to do in a backhoe of Barangay Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and now is the camp of Pres. Noynoy Aquino and in fact, there are nine Ampatuans who will run under the Liberal Party in the coming election?
However, the face and name of the "culture of lack of responsibility" or "culture of Norcia can still be made by President Noynoy Aquino to set up the time, month, month, or a few decades, which can be considered as Temporal and powerful.
Maybe it is not as well as a huge sin that Noynoy Aquino can do with the 58 victims of the massacre at Maguon, but it seems that the victims who are waiting for justice should be buried and not to pay for justice, take care of the ones who are waiting for justice, take care of the people who are waiting for justice, take care of the people who are fighting and fighting for justice.
That is why there is a huge voice against it that it was revealed in a deep predicament that a reply to the response: NEVER FORGT) and NEVER Ejercito.
