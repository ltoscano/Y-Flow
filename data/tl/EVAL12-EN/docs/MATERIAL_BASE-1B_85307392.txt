Let's be a recall, Mayor Larang TIDs.

Puerto Princesa is currently trending in Puerto Princesa, not because of its own wealth and beauty but in the reported recall of Mayor Lucilo Bayambang.
It is sad because this summer season, it is time to build a chance to hoard the city of income in tourism.
"It's because everyone knows that Puerto Princesa is rich with the beautiful scenery that we enjoy.
Because of the clean and fruitful areas, just like the ground river, "there are many foreign tourists who visit them but because of the reported" fight between Mayor Bayas, "it is not good for the city.
In the effects of the victory of May 2013 PRIMO, after a long time, the new mayor had a new mayor in Puerto Princesa in the character of Mayor Bayambang.
Mayor Bayas defeated the wife of former Mayor Edward Hagibis as it to run for senator, but he also did not get lucky.
It is painful for those that he served in the election for a long time, but it seems that life is really good in the election, but that's really like that, it appears in the report that former Mayor Hagorn (it can be removed from Puerto Princesa mayor.
In the reports, it was refuted by the Hagorn, but to Mayor Bayambang, he believes that ex-Mayor Hagorn (it would be sure that this is the fight between two sides and for sure, this will end and where their conflict will lead?
Whoever will win and lose, only time will say but they know that while they are arguing, Puerto Princesa is being hit.
Because of their fight, instead of millions of tourists will come, there might be a few who visited the known city of Palawan.
To those who are spreading that the crime is spreading, so, who will go to Puerto Princesa if the order and order is bad.
Mayor Bayambang is not at fault but the only reason why he is talking about is because he voted for him last election.
