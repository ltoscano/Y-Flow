I thought that I am the father-in-law, who are your viand, how do you do not have a big sister in your house, right me again at noon in the afternoon, that's why we have a lot of snack time ago at noon.
What do you worry later at noon?
Whatever snack time you leave, you said.
So much; we will look down; let us go later or go ahead.
Where are you now, where are you here on the street?
What are you doing is selling?
