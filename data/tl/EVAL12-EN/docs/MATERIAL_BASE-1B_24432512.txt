Okay, why would I call me 'cherness; so I thought that we are very pitiful; we think that we are the only ones who are the only ones who can be seen to be the ones who are not in order; we can't see it.
Yes, what else.
That's why I am very pitiful; I don't know if I do not know what kind of time you might do whatever time it is at around eight-five o'clock in the same time.
Okay, what are you angry?
Yes, he / she is very pitiful, very fur.
