From Tacloban to blows, Leyte?

President Benigno Aquino III did not hide his love, not in Tacloban City and his citizens, but also with Romualdez.
Remember what Interior Secretary Mar Roxas said, a few days after Typhoon Yolanda devastated the Leyte and neighboring provinces, to Tacloban City Mayor Alfred Romualdez and our President now, a Aquino last x "x"
Then, this is over the commemoration of a year since Yolanda struck, Bo'clock in the town of Guda and Palo, and not Tacloban, Aquino said, the two towns were ruined in the two towns compared to Tacloban?
In PNoy's words, the airport is going to be transferred to Tacloban to Palo?
A big inconvenience!
President Noy Aquino said that there are two consecutive storm surge, "the airport, and the airport, will not be moved away, but when we are flooded, we need to transfer him again," that is why we need to transfer him again because it is possible that we are going to transfer him as an alternative. "
Leyte Congressman Ferdinand Romualdez has the answer of Leyte Congressman Ferdinand Romualdez, "the Small Town Lottery, adversary, adversary, the personnel of the airport, and the abuse of the airport to avoid the clearing operations of the airport to avoid the proliferation of monasteries in 24 hours,"
To make a new airport in Palo, P12-billion what is needed is there is a need for it, what if it is a strong venom on what your problem is, Mister President?
It is clear that the political plan of the Marcos regime is clear on the issue of the airport in Leyte.
Kabayo is going to transfer the Tacloban airport in Palo, Leyte.
The truth is, the Liberal Party needs a big fund in 2016. To P12 billion pesos that will pretend to be for Palo airport? "That is not PNoy?" It is not PNoy?
