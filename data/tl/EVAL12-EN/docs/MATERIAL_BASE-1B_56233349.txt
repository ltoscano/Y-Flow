Slaps, punches and socks PNoy.

The allies of President Aquino are the ones who will earn bad for the management of the country, like a game for basketball, so he was slapped hard with his ally because of the foolishness or being stupid in the ball of the ball in the ring.
Like the said game, the management of the country needs a integrity, and PNoy needs as the captain of our national team.
But what if the captain of the ball is kind, "because his team could not allow her team to win over the victory, Senator Serge Osme単a said that it's only dumb of PNoy in the leadership of" Team Philippines. "
Last year 2010, Osme単a was the campaign to become a captain of the team of team.
He did not understand the belief that many told him that it is kind of clothing, Tita Cory.
Now, he is not wondering why the call of PNoy is irritating.
In the last released data of the Bureau of treasury, the country sank in debt after jumping a 5 percent in the edge of "Team Philippines" in the past month of January because of domestic and foreign contacts.
It means, the P5.334 years of debt of the country, which was raised to P56,594 at present, it appears that the debt of the Philippines was increased by 1.5 million every month.
Osme単a now is so embarrassed to his chicken "because there is nothing good to be good in the team of the Philippines," the simple race "on his side going to a basket, without a score, which is why it cannot reach a score.
According to Osme単a, if you make mistakes, he is blamed by Banoga.
What are included in the team of PNoy like Mar Roxas, Butch Abad, Dinky Soliman and many others, that is why there are many others, that is why they can beat basketball.
But it is not really a basketball team led by PNoy.
He is being mistreated he is a country to maintain peace in poverty and are submerged in debt.
We have to endure for two years in the act of Banoga, as they say, we will suffer.
