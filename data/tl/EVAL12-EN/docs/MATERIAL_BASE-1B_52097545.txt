House helper was house helper in Riyadh that was repatriated on July 25, 2016.
Sir / Mam.
I wanted to go home because I was always fighting my boss since last month, I was always saying that I would always ask help from the agency here in Riyadh to be sent home because I was weakening and I cannot work.
The agency called my boss, I was hurt by my male boss, I was pulled by my male boss in April 24, and I went down to my salary in April 26 in the morning.
I said, I wonder that I am going to work if I am weakening if you take revenge on my salary for me to even ask me even for my fare.
He said that I finished my contract, I did not want to pay the paper that I did not want, but I did not want me to go to my room and I did not want me to go to my room and I did not want me to escape from my room and I did not want me to escape from my room and I did not have any things using my cellphone.
If I have not called my boss in my boss, I still don't want me to work until now, I still don't want me to work, I am always afraid that I don't want me even if they do not want me to go ahead, Mariecar L. Calata.
We are calling the Overseas Filipino Welfare Administration (OWWA) as well as the personnel of the Philippine Overseas Labor Office (shirt) in Riyadh Saudi Arabia to save our fellow Mariecar.
Mariecar was initially able to go to the United OFW who was headed by Mister John Leonard Montalban, and was sent to the authorities but the said agency of the government should be focused on the situation and welfare of our fellow OFWs.
Through the budget of Mariecar, we are hoping that the right agencies of the government are hoping to get the appropriate action as soon as possible, we are holding the appropriate action in the soonest time.
