Jen, the beauty of Cebu!
By Rose, June 13, 2016 was the last request for Jennylyn Mercado last vacation recently in Cebu, we believe that the Kapuso star is deserving to be the Kapuso star as the FHM "traslacion" but no matter what angles, she has become sexy and became sexy.
Different kinds of fear that Jennylyn will post in her Facebook and Instagram account while in a resort in Cebu, and his ego is clearly seen.
There are those who have been shot down on each other for a long time, that Jennylyn is really famous in the beach, Jennylyn, and a big Factor, who is said to be Mommy Lydia to that, which is not because of your mother, that's why you cannot handle when her costume is gone.
Anyway, it is obvious that Jennylyn is taking care of his free days for the coming Sunday, it seems that Jennylyn is still having a difficulty in deciding, it seems that Jennylyn is still having a difficulty in which the contract is to sign.
It is also the one who is going to take care of Jennylyn, that in just one day, his manager was surprised when he gave a Rolex gift that we know is not simply the amount even if there is no occasion.
We already thought, that's why Jen was first thankful for the possible contract she is wearing, huh!
