It did not last long after a few days, the taken advantage of a warehouse in Russel Avenue in Pasay City was confiscated.
Included in those who need to give birth to the arrest of them are Ret. Brigade General Reynaldo Oratier, chief of Staff of Lim.
It is because Lim is always blaming Lim in the quick solution to the case filed against Adelana.
Most of the broker and important forces are supported by Lim to replace the position of Lim because the mother decided to run again for senator who will run for senator in 2013.
That's why the BOC did not worry if Lim leave the aid because they have a big trust to Orcauldron.
