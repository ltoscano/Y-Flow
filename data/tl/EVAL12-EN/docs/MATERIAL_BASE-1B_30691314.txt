Kylie and Imelda BE is Jeanne Calment of November 3, 2016.
Even though the fate is far from afar, it will not be easier to stop the two of the beautiful scenery that will be used in the recently international beauty pageant as the representative of our country.
This is Kylie Versoza, who was elected 2016 Miss International and Miss Philippines Miss Earth Imelda Schweighart is putting up the crown.
Compared to Kylie, Imelda was going home to the pageant which was held in Japan, Imelda was not able to fight the Miss Earth that was held in our country, which is sad because a few of our countrymen are lonely about the failure reached by Imelda.
It will be studied in social media that instead of protests or expressing his opposition to any involvement with the Top 16 of Imelda, many joined the defeat of our bet.
Reason behind all this is what is shown on the rough attitude of Miss Earth Philippines while in the midst of the competition, particularly the released criticisms against the President of our country.
That's why we cannot blame the people who does not want our fight against the recently Miss Earth.
Too far from the amount that the Filipino people showed to Kylie, who stayed silent despite the successful success.
Hopefully, this will serve as a lesson from the competition, this event will lead to Miss Earth.
Because netizens are too active in social media, it will be revealed that the lack of budget will be revealed that is why it should be more aggressive especially if there is a high dream.
That is why with the number of Filipinas who are fighting for the beauty pageant, they are excited to get the title even for the most common people because of the support being shown by the Filipino people.
But if there is a problem with your behavior in my opinion, even if you are a Filipino in exchange of support because they are not targeting Filipinos.
