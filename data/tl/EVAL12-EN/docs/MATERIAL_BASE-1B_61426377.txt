Thank you, Leonardo Espina.

I rarely look up with the high officials of the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), that I have not personally known each other as the chief of NCRPO Patrol Group (PNP-HPG) or the former Traffic Management Group (PNP-HPG) or the former Traffic Management Group (PNP-HPG) or the former Traffic Management Group (PNP-HPG) or the former Traffic Management Group (PNP-HPG).
But it is deeper, that is what I liked in the newly appointed NCRPO Chief Espina, this is his only wish as a very big lesson for the motorists and police who should not give protection and not to extort.
Think about it, the wife and the children of Hen. Espina, "if they were wrong about the traffic rules, they are trying to introduce themselves as the family of the police or military as a lieutenant when they thought that they were seated in the government.
Now, due to the investigation of Hen. Espina to the police who have been involved with cases, not only Senior Police Officer 3 De la Pena was removed from the service, but many others were surprised to clean the ranks of the PNP even if it's just you who thought to put the international line in NCRPO.
To our countrymen, General Espina is our new maid, but, of course, we need to forget our car or a motorcycle that we can do even if our car is near us, we can't forget to open the window of our car.
"Let us not let it be opened to whatever we are carrying from the backpack or any kind of boils of our motorcycle, do not let us agree to get the name of our motorcycle," we should always remember to take the name of the police to take a report immediately.
Now, even if you intensified with our motorists, our motorists will continue to be peaceful and hopefully our streets continue to be peaceful, thank you very much to you General Leonardo Espina!
