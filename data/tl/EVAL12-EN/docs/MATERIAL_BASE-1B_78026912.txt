Have you able to receive an invitation to a celebration with RSVP? "RSVP's words," Neal del VP, "to know if you are going to be able to attend or not.
There is one story that sometimes, God ordered an angel to go to the earth and let us remember that there are people who are evil in our world, but we should have told us that there are people who are evil in our world, "we should have told us that it is good for us to love him / her," that's why we'll be able to give a letter to us by God, "we should have told us that it is good for us to be able to love him," that is why we'll be able to give a letter to us by the Lord, "you should have told us that it is good for us to be able to answer to us," that is why we'll be able to give a letter to us!
