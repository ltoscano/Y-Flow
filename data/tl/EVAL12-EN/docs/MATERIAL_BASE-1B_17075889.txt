Golez is focused on K + 12.

Muntinlupa City Mayor Jaime Fresnedi may have a big help in the Department of Education (DepEd) to promote the K + 12 program for students.
Through the established by Senior High School Task Force of DepEd and the administration of Fresnedi, the arrival of the brightness of the Black Nazarene will be greater than the senior High School in the next school Year.
Based on the study of DepEd, they will be able to find it hard for the influx of grade 11 to 12 in 2016 because of the increase of number of students who want to finish their studies.
Because of this, Cayetano visited the said office of Fresnedi in order to give a solution which was given attention by the mayor so that people will not have a difficulty.
One of the solutions that Fresnedi can be seen is the construction of the companies that will be used by the senior High School in public schools, aside from increasing teachers.
Aside from this, the local government will also have a general act to give attention to the possibility of transfer of students from the public funds.
The mayor also said the Muntinlupe√±os can count on the local government to help them achieve their father school diploma that they can use for their future.
Aside from Fresnedi, included in those who are his appointed administration of Senior High School Task Force were identified as Priscilla de Sagayungan, Doctor Dalida, "Urkupina, Congressman Rodolfo Biazon, Gary Leste and Noli Chua.
We can call this kind of steps from a city as a concern because the future of their countrymen is what they are thinking of, how to give a good future.
We salute this step of Fresnedi and other individuals who are together with this project, hopefully this is just an example of other cities and municipality not only in Metro Manila but also in the provinces of ALNAs Womb of Alvin Feliciano.
