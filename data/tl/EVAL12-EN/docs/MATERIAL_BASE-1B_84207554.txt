President Benigno Aquino III and relatives are victims of violence after their father Benigno Aquino, Jr., was murdered in Tarakan last August 21, 1983 by alleged soldiers but until now, he is still not considered a hole.
Now, there are many victims of violence that are not yet solved and given justice to their death, because he experienced the pain that lost their loved ones because of violence, he fixed the country on peace and order.
But what is happening is President Noynoy faced his "Daang Matuwid" in defending his boiled bananas in making money.
PNoy does not care of those who are hungry, unemployed and poor people, which if their bones do not eat, are forced to eat, which is why they are forced to make mistakes like stealing.
But what is painful, even the killing is also done by others to live for their families because the current administration has no job to give the current administration.
Because the Aquino family experienced the cruelty of cruelty, especially in politics, President Aquino should not do the harassment of the citizens, especially those who will escape.
But what is happening?
Many judge, businessmen and journalists were killed and until now, President Aquino has not yet given justice to help them?
Aside from condemned the murder, Malaca√±ang was staring blankly and even the Philippine National Police.
If there is a big case that the high officials of the government and PNP have a big case, are they being charged?
If that is the case, the President is also a victim of human rights?
An advice from President Aquino, he should try to try why he does not get a advisers from the sectors of those who will surface and the poor, through his acceptance of it, he will surely give the real needs of the poor.
Because it is full of spoon in the mouth of the consultant that's why PNoy is not expecting the real happening in the sectors of the poor and even the ordinary citizens.
