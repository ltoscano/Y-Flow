A government.

It is obvious now that the brain is in thorough implementation of the primary products, particularly rice in the country.
And it is obvious that our government is useless just to suppress the price of products, including the petroleum products.
The truth is, the government is very numb about the suffering of the filipino citizens to feel like that.
Every time the price of products will push through, there are garner lots of capitalists have.
They creates artificial lack of supply of products in order to follow the suspension of the price.
A sample of those are said to be the lack of supply of garlic, onions, ginger, rice and many others.
They do this so that the broken product can be exposed that are all divorced from other countries.
They are able to ask for the author as to when they should manipulate and the poor people do the one who has a difficult time.
They know when will they make a move to acquire money from the buyers.
What is painful, we have a agency that needs to set a proper price of products and that is the Department of Trade and Industry but this is useless for the welfare of the people.
We also have agency (National Food Authority), who should save when they go out of the products, such as rice, businessmen who are greedy but are just fed up and are receiving the excuse that they are receiving.
In the current crisis, it is very popular for these agencies and the most worse, the administration is still making their lack of use instead of making up and going to the position.
Is it not the government himself, even the agencies that are useless in taking advantage of businessmen who violate the products?
What do you think?
