"Do you, Sir Al-R.

One of the world of sports that the new President Rodrigo Duterte made will be invited to Malaca√±ang for a special meeting with the questionable athletes just for a week before they push for the Philippines in the Sydney Olympics in a month, from August 5 to 21.
President Duterte gave a huge inspiration for athletes.
The message of Duterte to the athletes is to do the athletes but not everyone is being given Chance to be hailed in the Olympics!
It has been a long time issue for our athletes and very beautiful beginning for the administration of Duterte to give personal attention to the journey of our athletes going to Rio Olympics.
The athletes are very happy because they were given a bigger money by the President.
On the very day of their visit in Malacanang, President Duterte announced it will be double the intense competition of the people.
Not only about money but for giving importance, our athletes did not pay attention to their athletes what the President did and they are more than to show their courage.
Hopefully, the government's support for our athletes does not continue for a long time that the situation of our athletes is a big problem.
It is not common to us their complaints, even the athletes who are not included in the Olympics like our popular news, that they themselves are making a way, a financial situation, just to be competing in other countries carrying our flag.
In the interview of the athletes who visited Malacanang, all of them are full of foolishness and extremely thankful to President Duterte.
I hope that they would be brought home by medals, especially in the field where we really have a fight, for example we are still saying that the Filipinos are going to raise the Filipinos such as the table Tennis, billiards and buprofen, Home ones, and others.
Good luck to our athletes.
President Digong said, "Jony Villon!
Thank you a love with May God, with thank you. Sibol, Atty. Ariel Enrile.
