The Sangguniang Kabataan is more intense.

I thought that the youth are the hope of the country but it seems that it is wrong, it is not wrong because it seems that the bystanders are stubborn and stubborn ones, you think they are sensible and interested in life but it is the opposite.

Look at the morning, bystanders are holding the forest, the song, and almost no one did not do anything but to their parents, they are not thinking of having a job, but they don't think that they have no job, the strength of the family is too much, and what they are doing in life.

Sometimes I cannot think, who really is the fault of the parents or the child who did not neglect their children, not the reason why poverty is not the reason for their child to discipline and teach a good manners and to learn to be responsible like what is expected.

There are some who change but most of them are numb, but instead of stopping and going home, they still need to get mad at night and they still need to get angry even if they will not feel it.

Many of the youth now, are able to get married early, if their parents don't know what they are doing with their friends, instead they know what is right and right, they are the ones who do not do what is right and right, they are going to be a trend of things that should not be done by the youth.

At night, they are still there - young women and men who act as a girlfriend, maybe because they are still not able to finish their studies, there is no need to finish the life and help to the family if you think they are the protagonist.

Where are the evil spirits like this, where are the good manners that's being pointed at them by the school and their parents, where are they hoping to be blamed for their parents, why are they hoping that they are like that, and probably, their understanding is wrong for the meaning of freedom.
