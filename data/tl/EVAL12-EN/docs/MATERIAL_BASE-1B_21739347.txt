On the third of August, a six-year-old was arrested by the head of Santiago after he was blamed for a few months after two months last Sunday and in red.
Is it a few hours that you want to shoot-up in December, his final red for the country.
Up to you, you have an idea of that.
The last thing he knew, he saw his mother who is his brother.
It was seven o'clock in the evening.
She reached me to my sibling that is why she was not able to see her color.
