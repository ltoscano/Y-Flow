Being missing in Kuwait.

A complaint was received from a friend and former classmates in the campus of the city of Manila, Catherine Sagala.
He said that they were extremely worried because since last week until yesterday, they could not be reached and talked to his brother Marialyn Moalliances, 28, who works in Kuwait as a domestic helper.
Based on Catherine's story, before they lost a contact with his sibling, he told them several times that he was begging and was not given to her employer.
And because of the cruelty of her employer, she wants to leave his job and just went home to the Philippines.
I found out that Marijuana was left last October 2013, and his recruiter, in the country, ASEAN Manpower Recruitment Agency) has a office at F.B. Harrison Street, Pasay City.
Last Monday, Marijuana was able to talk with his family on the telephone and then said that he decided to go to the Philippine Embassy in Kuwait to report his bad condition.
But what hurts, since then, could not be reached by Marialyn and they cannot determine where she is and what is his condition now.
They tried to go to Recruitment agency to ask for help, but they were surprised when they discovered that it was closed to POEA because of various violations of the law.
That is why they are more nervous now about what happened to Marialyn's situation, especially since he did not even give the name and address of his boss in Kuwait before he disappeared.
Because of this, Catherine was calling out to the right offices of the government like DOLE, POEA, OWWA and DFA, hoping that they could be helped by the missing relative, Marijuana, caliber.
Even me are personally calling the appropriate agencies and even in the Philippine Embassy in Kuwait that they should pay attention to this case of Marialyn.
Take action and do not allow you to be united with that!
