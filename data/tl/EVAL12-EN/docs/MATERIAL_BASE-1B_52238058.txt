Cruz: 05 in all of us, the Catholic Church By Juliet is still standing after she was still standing by the church, she was still standing by the priest and what I said is, in general. "
This is the answer of Lingayen Dagupan Archbishop Emeritus Oscar Cruz of the latest insult of President-elect Rodrigo Duterte in the Catholic Church in the last press conference in Davao City the day before yesterday night.
"I did not say anything bad to him and I respect him as the new President of the country and I hope that he will not talk to him," said the retired bishop to file a case against him although he has long been dead.
Cruz explained that it is only him who said that if there are priests or bishop who has done corruption, they should complain because there is allegedly one of the church that comes from the church.
In the end, Cruz said that he will respect Duterte and the entire officials of his government because the success or failure of the government is the people who will benefit or be released.
