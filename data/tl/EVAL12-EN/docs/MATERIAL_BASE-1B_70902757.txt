I am sorry, Mr. President.

The birthday of the former President Quezon yesterday.
7th of August, 1878 was born in Baler, Quezon.
Maybe the rising of the internet is increased because of those who are studying the issues regarding Manuel Luis Molina Quezon, the first President of the Philippines, who was identified by other countries.
All of us should go back to the former President.
What kind of person is he?
How will he led, what kind of leader, and if he is the president now, what will he do with the issues of poverty, corruption, giving importance to self as Filipinos and in the Philippines as our own country.
One of the famous words of Quezon is "I am a" government official laid down by the approval of the local government focused on the X-governmental organization.
What does he want to say in that words during that time, in the middle of war.
What would Quezon now feel now when he knew that most of our countrymen are dreaming of living in other countries like America to get away from poverty?
Some of the candidates said, the leadership of Quezon is one of the most full of challenges because of the war and because the Philippines is still starting to stand in as a defense of false countries.
What kind of President is Manuel Quezon?
One lawyer, was born in Baler and grew up not rich.
Pres. Quezon is mad at America before that's why he asserted the freedom of the Philippines from the meddling of the government of the Americans.
While now, the economy of our country depends on the money given by Overseas Filipino Workers or our countrymen who earn dollars in America.
It is important to study history because in the letter it can be resolved by any leader.
I am sorry, Mister President!
