Truth should prevail.

Many were shocked from what happened to Vhong Navarro.
The truth is, "did not play in my mind that a day will be cut off just like that, and they even sold it, according to the statement of his / her son's statement.
A lot of people are going to make the news come out after the alleged beating of Vhong in a condominium in Taguig.
As said by the famous and stay-in-time show "IT's show time" on Channel 2, he was beaten and attempted to fly to P2 million.
In her statement, Cedric Lee, together with a few more men are able to beat up and hang up with his personality.
The appearance of Vhong is really pitiful, so like the many who watched the news on television, he felt very angry with the beating.
It is good that Lee went out and insisted that he was beaten-tempered because he was caught while he was allegedly attempting to kill Deniece Cornejo.
Lee also refuted that his group was going to support Vhong, and explained that the requested increase was paid for the damaged things in the condo where the attempted rape happened.
Cornejo also spoke and was proven by Lee's statement that he was attempted to be raped by Vhong.
In the stories about the events of Vhong, Cornejo and Lee, like on the card, "you do not know what happened, king or queen.
"We do not know who among them are right and telling the truth.
Also added to the problem is the foolishness of the personnel of SPD director C / Supt. Dionardo Villacorta who first knew the incident.
Where do you find policemen who were brought to them the crime but they are just doing nothing but what is right.
Except if the children of General Villacorta are hiding something that's why they did not do their sworn duties.
Because it is also confused on the statement of both sides, the NBI will join again and should be found out so that it can be found out.
Justice is the call of Vhong, as well as Cornejo and Lee, so the truth should prevail.
