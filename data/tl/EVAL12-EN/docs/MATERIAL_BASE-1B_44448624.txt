Nanay's heart was heart.

Nanay's heart was the heart of Nanay's heart when we heard that we have no words to identify the parents who lost their child, but when their parents did not have a wife, she said that the children would not have a child, and not the parents who would be the burial of the child.

That is why there are times when the child is sick, they want to give their own life, if they can just give their own life to have a little life in Calamba, Laguna, a young man was born in Calamba, Laguna, a young man.

His son is still young when she was taught by her mother when she was raped by her mother when she was still alive when her mother was raped by her mother, but she also had a heart to see her mother, while she was also a heart of mother, and thank you to the mother of Rizal.
