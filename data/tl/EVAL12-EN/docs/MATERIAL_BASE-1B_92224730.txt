Be followed by the follow!

Our dreams serves as a gasoline for our desire to continue perseverance in running in the race of life.
In the United States, I met a Filipino who once dreamed and was not afraid to follow and reach them - Glen Basina.
Glen is still young and she wants to have a good life, which is why when it was not easy, she left the Philippines in order to go to America and to look for his fate but it was heavy for myself, "he said.
Too much loneliness, Glen was experienced in her first year in the said country.
"The poorest person in the funeral is to Adora, it seems like I have a culture shock," he added a story.
It was not easy to look for a job for Glen because even if she was able to finish the course of civil engineering here in the Philippines, the security guard and a caresses up his job, and it is far away from the course he finished.
According to him, he was not hesitant to enter that job because he believes that he will not last in that situation and after a few years, a real Estate agent asked him to also be a part-time as a member of the real Estate.
It was not long before that he became an unlicensed public agent who became a way for him to continue to succeed in the field until he will build the help of a friend with a friend with a friend and properties in the entire America.
At present, he acted as the manager of the said company, and here is his advice for people like him who wants to follow their lives, that is why if you want to reach their lives, that is why you don't know, "that is a lot of good thing that is annoying."
