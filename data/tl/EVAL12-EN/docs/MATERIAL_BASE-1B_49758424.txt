Education is the Muntinlupa City.

Young people in Muntinlupa are lucky because the current regime is a priority of education.
For those who do not know, from elementary school to college there is a scholarship for the Marcos regime, which is why the youth have a chance to have a good future in the said city.
We have a saying that the youth are in hope of the country so we can see in the city of Muntinlupa the assurance that there is a good direction of the youth.
What Mayor Jimmy Fresnedi can do is right at 1pm to education because this is a good sign especially if we are talking about the progress of a place and the people.
It is certain that there is no man who will make it in Mslowly and it is also certain that it would be very rare in this city because it is a proper care for their leaders.
We found out that there are more than 3,000 pesos in Muntinlupa that is why it is really impressed.
The city government gives P100,000 every month of 300 pesos, P400 to the High School which costs 113 million pesos in their College.
"It was impressed" is it not surprising if Muntinlupa is not surprising if the Muntinlupa are benefiting from their members of the 3-CBN News Laude and 9-cum Laude.
Aside from a scholarship, the Muntinlupa Polytechnic High School and Pamukid in the city of Muntinlupa are also strengthened even more.
There are a lot of projects which are being made by Fresnedi like the classrooms in Tibagan, High School and the gym in Muntinlupa National High School.
It is certain that the good future of the youth in Muntinlupa is certain that there are still a lot of Fresnedi in becoming a leader of the country.
