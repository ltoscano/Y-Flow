Janet Napoles will surely point the congressman and senators who are involved in the P10 billion pork barrel scam to prove that he is the one guilty in this issue.
If he is not guilty, perhaps he will be placed in the witness protection program by the Department of Justice (DOJ) like the non-called protection program, including Benhur Luy, cousin of Janet.
It is not included in the accused about the P10 billion pesos scam, Benhur, although they were signed by said fake non-government organization (NGO) who benefited from this case.
"We just distanced from us," Benhur said in a hearing in the Senate, "the true owner of an NGO), Napoles."
What I know is illegal is illegal, so the Ombudsman should also bring them to the lower ranks of the accused.
According to Lorna Kapunan, law of Napoles, the congressman and senators are not safe in this case but it is not acceptable for the excuse that their chief of staff did not know about it.
Those people involved in the widespread robbery should be punished the moment that their living room will be punished even if they make the lower part, congressman, senator, employees of the government, or even him, Missus Napoles.
There is a doubt that Napoles will be a state witness, the possibility that Justice Secretary Leila de Lima has not been neglected.
This is also what Lorna Kapunan will ask for.
Will the country allow Napoles to erase it?
It seems that I was spreading the outcome of this case.
There are quarrels that can be done for the P10-peso scam?
And will the crooks allow their pork barrel to disappear?
How about their names?
The poor who have sickness?
The farmers?
