Every October, we continue to ask for help from Saint Rosario of the Holy Rosario for the book of Habana, our Lord, and the right thing is living with his loyalty, but the right thing is living with his loyalty, even at the appointment of Espiritu of power, love and self-control of worldliness.
Let us also ask from Jesus to increase our faith in the Day of our faith in God, that we continue to serve us every day of our faith in God, serving our fellowmen, service, service, service, service, service, and work hard to take a good and livers.
