Make it a habit to read.

The books are extraordinary and mysterious.

A person who can be washed away is living with many thousands of lives before he passed by a person who has never been reading, the beauty of the world, the beauty of the world, the beauty of the world, the beauty of the world, and if education is expensive, it is more expensive and expensive.

There are three kinds of people when they learned from reading 2) the few who learned from reading 2) the few who learned from reading it, as well as the orders of many people, this is the reason why there are many who get rich and there are only few who get rich.

Here is the rightfulness of the person who eat or lie down on his wife or preparing to sleep with a high level of character, than one of the christians who are listening to a high level of music, and mixed in different parts of the sector when there's a high level of transportation.

All the books are written, mysterious, it is only about the connection and event that he will discover, it is only natural for him to give in to his whole life, but it is only natural for him to give in to a sudden surprise, and affectionate to face, it is natural for him to give in exchange for those who are being made in favor of it.

Do you know?

This is true: If you do not have a time to read, you have no time to write to you, because you cannot hear what you have not read and if you do not have a content, this is just a proof that this is the content of the straight pillow.

Think first before reaching out and read first before writing to me, we always read, dance, and laugh, all of these are to be happy in the short life that was given to us by the Lord.
