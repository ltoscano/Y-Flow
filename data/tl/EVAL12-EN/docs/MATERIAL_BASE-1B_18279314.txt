Witnesses: The two are going to push through?
Jimmy and Jimmy Cantos or June 18, 2016, the former Philippine Sports Commission, Butch Ramirez is not interested to touch the agency again for those who do not know, Ramirez has been served as the chief of PSC in the time of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Ramirez agrees that in the election as one of the trust of Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, he is one of the direct party of Duterte in the places where the latter is in the campaign.
Because Duterte has won, many are expecting that Butch Abad will be put in a good position but until now, I still have not heard any position for him, but instead, what I hear is the personalities who are said to be interested for being the chairman of the PSC.
Since the PSC served in 1991, the chief of the agency has tons of people.
Some have succeeded in their position but more of the management has a failure.
As told by one of his friend, he / she was a running Toyota Innova.
Duterte is on the final decision on who would be able to buy Garcia, who became the chairman of PSC since 2010 when President Aquino was elected.
I was not able to express what happened to Garcia while he was seated as long as what I know is that we did not end the four in the SEA Games since 2010 until last year.
What I really want to see is if the proposal of Liberal-list Congressman Mikee Romero will push through with the Department of Sports Complex in exchange of the PSC.

Of course, if this happens, our interest will also be a big interest on who will be the first target of it and what has a huge impact to our sports development program.
It is said that if there is an Department of Sports), the flow of sports will be more beautiful and it will be better to take care of the athletes because there will be a budget if the budget is lacking in order for us to have declared champion in Asia and in the Olympics.
When will the tire move towards having the Department of Sports or two?
