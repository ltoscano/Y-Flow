Witnesses: The call of boxing.
By Jimmy Cantos or July 16, 2016.
Senator Manny Pacquiao denied recently that he will ask for help from the Senate to prepare for his return to the ring on October.
Pacman said, his priority now is his job as senator.
But I will not be surprised if the arrival of October is that we will see Pacman on top of the ring in Las Vegas, because Pacman said, the boxing source of his / her family is coming from his family and the money he uses for helping those in need.
In simpler terms, the salary given by Pacman is not enough for helping those who are asking for support from him.
Pacman added that when he ran as a senator in May, he promised that he would not neglect his job in the Senate if he gets elected.
Pacman is already worried in boxing but I will not be surprised if one of the punches are still lacking in him, the question is how can one escape his responsibility as a senator in order to have time for training.
One way, the surrounding him said, he will training if there is no session in the Senate.

But is this possible, will it hit the date of his training?
What will his fellow senators say, and his fellow politicians, when he goes back to the ring and has not been absent, just like what he did in the House of Representatives to have training?
For sure someone will tell that he does not have a word because there is surely someone who will say that he should not stop him because his livelihood is in boxing.
