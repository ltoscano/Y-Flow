Erap left, Lim perfect, Isko Moreno?

The local government of Manila is in danger because of the expected decision of the Supreme Court about the fate in politics of Mayor Erap Estrada.
Of course, the camp of Erap says that he is qualified to run in any position in the government every time the election in the country is coming after he is given forgiveness by the government of Miss Gloria.
His opponents in Manila questioned him even before Erap was even mayor of former Mayor Fred Lim who was friends but allegedly fought because of a garbage contract.
Now that the decision of the Supreme Court is approaching, it is certain that Lim's followers are ready to bury the City Hall in Manila while the camp of Erap is preparing.
It's because it is strong that the decision of the court against Erap is very strong that's why it is certain that the members of the original AsiatiSalonga of the Filipino movie will have been used.
If the qualifications of Erap should not be the one to replace his throne, according to his friend, Lim will benefit from this because he is the opponent of Erap in 2013.
I'll be "epal" epal ", even if Erap remain in his term, it is still unlikely that he becomes a mayor because it is certain that he will still pass the throne like what happened in San Juan City.
Even if Lim took office again he could no longer be able to make it in the past elections, instead, for sure, it will be surprised that it will end up from Dr and Harry of Manila.
There are some officials of Manila who have been committed suicide by Lim, but now they will take shelter with Erap's umbrella such as a "Barangay" kristo "to hide from the alias" epal "
Even if the generals of Lim made a tickle, it was so delicious to return to the throne of the power of Manila Mayor Erap, you were taking advantage of all of all the ducks which are severely affected!
He / she was wearing.
