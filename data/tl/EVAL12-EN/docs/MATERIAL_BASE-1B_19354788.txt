Hope and struggle.

It is not bad to depend.
In fact, that is what many of our countrymen who are forced to work outside the country due to lack of hope will change in his life.
And probably, "that is also the first hope that drug pushers should be used to join the overseas absentee voting which will start this Saturday.
Even if the Commission on Elections (Comelec) and the Aquino government have already caught up, it is prohibited to go down and are lacking in preparation for the fourth V V.
After almost 10 years since the first 8V, the treatment of the government has not changed, education is still not changed, education is lacking, education and the launch of PV will just be defiant, just say that there is an V V.
But they are going to join, and there should be some OFWs in the election because it is not bad to depend.
What's dangerous is the blind hope.
"We hope that only because of the promise, change will come true or it is blind to hope that the election will bear wide and long term change.
How many elections have passed, it has already passed by the outcome of the Saligang Batas and not the strengthening of their own economy, how many elections have passed and has been left behind by the OFWs?
There are many elections that passed but the relationship of OFWs who gave even just a little pain in the situation of illegal immigrants that may happen to their issues, it is just going to happen if there is only one movement of illegal immigrants.
So it is true that it is not bad to depend on if hope is for the active struggle.
