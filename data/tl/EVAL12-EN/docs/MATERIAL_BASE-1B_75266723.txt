PNP and BPM 8 of Calbayog City, all stupid (1)

Last Wednesday afternoon, while we were traversing the highway to Calbayog City, Samar from Tacloban, I wondered why the members of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penterm (BJMP) are scattered on the highway.
Later on, we found out that 16 prisoners were able to escape from 87 from 87 houses, which were held by Bible Study inside the prison in Brgy. Gademia, Calbayog City.
I saw the fear of Calbayog City Police, at around 6: 00 in the evening, their doors are almost closed in fear that they might enter the fugitives and do their human rights.
I observed the movements of the police and the BJMP that I saw their failures.
First of all, if they noticed the checkpoint in the highway, it seems that the residents of BJMP were not standing on the side of the road while they were just looking at the bus terminals and other vehicles.
Even their point of Single Entry Approach, the soldiers, police and BJMP were not able to do anything, but most of the 16 who escaped are all cases of murder.
Even the guzzle of their houses in Allen, Samar going to Matos, Sorsogon have not yet seen any checkpoint here when it is the biggest point of Entry SEC.
I am not wondering why until I am writing this, the police or military still do not catch any of the 16 fugitives because the law enforcers in the province of Samar is still not caught.
According to Calbayog City Police Chief Superintendent Elmer Chappelle, of Bible Students, around 9: 45 last Wednesday morning, April 2 when a prisoner fired a 9 millimeter pistol from a jail guard and here the conflict started.
If it was not that our personnel of BJMP here have not been useless, it seems that they were able to get the 2 M16 rifle, shotgun and a 9 millimeter pistol and according to our source, the residents of BJMP seemed like they were just looking at the fugitives while coming out in prison.
