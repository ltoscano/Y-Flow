Wrong.

When PNoy ran as President, many of our countrymen supported him because of wrong thought and after four years he led the country, backwards, and not to help the kind of life of our citizens.
PNoy said that, if there are no corrupt, no one is poor, but while it gets buried, our countrymen are still increasing and have no job.
If we will follow the principle that our president is used to, it means that there will be more corruption under his leadership, the poor will increase, and there are also corrupt.
Is that so, sir?
Many of us thought before that PNoy will support the rights of our countrymen who are firm in order to defend themselves against criminals, which is why many are happy, including your servant, when it won.
But instead of supporting their rights, it is even more of our countrymen who have legal owners who owns a gun, which is why they know that under PNoy, their citizens do not have a fight against PNoy.
As the son of our known martyr, Ninoy and former President Cory Aquino, who is recognized as the mother of our democracy, many believed before that he will support the free journalism, many have been hoping that the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (FOI) law has been served.
But instead of stopping the FOI, PNoy was only able to see each other in supporting the FOI while he was one of the critics of Pres. Gloria Arroyo because of his failure to push the anti-cybercrime law and now, the anti-cybercrime law and now that the anti-cybercrime law is still under the internet.
We have to endure for two years under PNoy and hopefully, in this time, he will wake up to the truth that he still does not have anything good for the country and for his own citizens.
