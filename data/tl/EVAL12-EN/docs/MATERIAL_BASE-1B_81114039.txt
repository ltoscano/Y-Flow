Bangayan, ORNC, Troy, Danny, Ronnie: Plague to Customs!

Customs Commissioner Sunny Sevilla should prove that what he is saying is true that those corrupt are prohibited in Adelana.
Because it is Banjo, Orchdo, Troy, Danny and Ronnie, the names of Sevilla and Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence Jessie Dellosa will continue.
It is clear in the statement of our informant to Customs that, for five, we have mentioned that those who have mentioned are just going to talk with whoever has a transaction with Adelana if they want to be even a nuisance.
Aside from a regular amount released by Banjo, Oretiquette, Danny, Troy and Ronnie every week, it is still aside from the incoming tanker.
The number of five who will take the price and price have also increased because it can be considered a bit cut off and can be guarded in BOC.
In a short word, they have not rejected a lot because they know that they are known to Asukal.
The team Work and five are said to be good because Troy and Ronnie Dayan will be the cause of the cargo trucks while Oretiquette, Banjo and Danny.
What is coming from, is it not right?
We will reveal many of the rotten trend in BOC and that is what we should wait for because our eyes are too fierce in the former bastion of Biazon, which is now said to be in the bastion of Purisima.
