Binay and Mejorada, right!

Wanna Bet by Roy "Mamondiong," Seneres (Filipino Star Ngayon), PO 2 44; Usahay, November 20, 2014 - 12: 00.

When Manuel Mejorada as DPWH Secretary Rogelio Singson and Tourism Sec. Ramon Jimenez was involved in his Job Fair against Senate President Frank Drilon, I know that his evil plan will not succeed.
If legality would not be the brains of Mejorada as Singson and Jimenez, who will believe that Singson and Jimenez is not the politician, what they are doing for is not a politician, but it seems that all Filipinos do not know anything except for Mejorada.
Frank Drilon became my boss in DOLE last Secretary of Labor Law but you are accused of all sorts of things not only corruption because the mother is right.
So even from the start, I said to myself, that this is a closed-called statement about the Iloilo Convention Center.
About VP Jojo Binay, I hope that I want to give a favor of the Philippines because somehow we are going to have a relationship with GMA because we believed that he was going to fight and tried to leave Binay as mayor of Makati, I was there beside him to fight Puno.
That's why I tried to give him the iron fist of the Philippines but it was very difficult because he was not appointed because there was no asphalt.

I became diplomat for 15 years but I cannot buy that kind of land, the salary of the mayor is small, "what he says is not true." It is obvious that it is not true.
Binay, the description of the description of the heart of the filipino masses to be released by the intelligence of the filipino masses.
