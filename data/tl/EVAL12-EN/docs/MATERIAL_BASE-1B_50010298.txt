TV Patrol, are still dead; long live the DAP.

According to him, the high-ranking officials of the government surfaced because there are only few who died, 40 + 12, from the past strong typhoon Glenda.
And they are extremely thankful to the Disbursement Acceleration Program which is the reason for having the Philippine Attach√© and Hacademics of new equipment in giving warning to the citizens about the typhoon, flood, storm surge and others.
What are you happy because there are few who died and we should also be thankful for DAP?
King-mother, do you notice that one of the high officials who have DAP died from Glenda but those who don't feel if there is DAP or not?
You can say that there is DAP that will die, let us just look at if you can celebrate and to pull the 20 who died.
The truth is why there are few who died because of the fear of the citizens of Yolanda, flood, storm surge, tsunami and obligation of those who are going to guide and help them in order to be saved from death and other danger.
The truth is, the local government became good but this is also due to the strong experience of Yolanda.
"Isn't it right, you said, that DAP has been not there for a long time but these local officials should take action to help them and the citizens for the goodness of all.
But it is still more important for the citizens to save themselves from danger, with or even the local government, especially those who cannot defend if there is no DAP.

Now, those who died there are already there, do you have a little bit, who will come from your DAP for the proper burial of them? If not, it's okay because you're the only ones with DAP, and we are no longer.

Additional point, make it a point, how can those who live without their livelihood, home and future? There is DAP that can be used for them as help?
We are asking because it seems that he is still alive in spite of the fact that they have stopped it for a long time but also ask Mar Roxas.
