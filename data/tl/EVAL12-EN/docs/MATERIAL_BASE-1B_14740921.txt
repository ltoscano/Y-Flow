Where is the part of the PDAF scam?

I thought there was also a part of the Department of Justice (DOJ) for those involved in the Priority Development Assistance Fund which is charged by the Office of the Ombudsman?
It seems that the DOJ and Ombudsman has already forgotten about it because the center of this anomaly is Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, Jinggoy Estrada and Bong Revilla and of course, Ma'am Pilar Janet Napoles.
Those who are involved in PDAF, who are former Customs Commissioner Ruffy Biazon, former senator, Ed Angara, is the former senator, Ed Angara, and Niel Tupas, Jr., and many others like the Agriculture Proceso Alcala.
Aside from that there is a Malhh scam that Napoles is still involved with the lawmakers and local government official.
Now we are in the chapter with the Development Assistance Program (DAP) that they are still those who are suspected to be involved in this scam.
Why is the filing of charges against them?
Just a little knowledge and forth to PDAF, the Country Development Assistance Fund was established by President Corazon Aquino and continued by President Fidel Ramos's seat that he named Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Noynoy Aquino.
It was made CDS or PDAF even if it is clear that the government officials and the lawmakers have been given a billion pesos and according to the Supreme Court, this is an effect and against the law.
Now, DAP was said to have been called on the pork barrel scam, but it was again released again and illegal.
But the Palace and the Congress doesn't want to leave the implementation of money of the country who wants to respond to bad people so in the new budget of the Congress, it's likely that the pork barrel scam is likely to have a new names.
