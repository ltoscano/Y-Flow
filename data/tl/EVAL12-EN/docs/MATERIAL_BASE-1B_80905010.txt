Many are starting to discover what fate is waiting for President Noynoy Aquino after the consecutive complaints that he is said to come from Malacanang.
When the military will withdraw the military against Erap Estrada, they immediately asked Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to run for President.
Erap was sentenced in corruption of the camp of Gloria, Erap released him after he gave him an apology of Gloria.
When the term of Gloria was finished, he was the one assigned by the newly elected President, Noynoy.
After the term of Noynoy in the next year or would he be removed from his position if ever there will be an official who will be held there?
If ever he will end his term, will he not be imprisoned by the next president?
Where will he be imprisoned, and should he be given the Presidential pardon?
It is likely that he will not be given protection especially if he is an ally of the President that will possibly be VP Jojo Binay?
Noynoy also can also be given protection by Binay because they have a relationship with each other, and of course, Gloria also will be given absolute pardon because they have a relationship with Binay.
Noynoy resign from the anger of Noynoy Aquino but who will replace PNoy?
Binay is because of the martial law?
If that is the case, he might be imprisoned by the Sandiganbayan according to his said sins to the country.
How long was the case of President Noynoy to be jailed before he will be given protection by the next president?
If ever there will be a strong military and a strong military who went to jail, that's why PNoy will be defeated by PNoy? And it will be a huge amount of accusations against him, like stealing from the treasury of the country? (EP / Raul VALNAs.
