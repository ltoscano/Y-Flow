We can do it: A big problem for PRody.
According to Keh's September 23, 2016, one of the current problems of the Duterte administration is the continuing bad news about our country which is spreading now in different countries like almost every day like The New York Times and-time Magazine that is happening in our country.
It seems that the whole world is confused and has no order in our country, I have many friends and relatives in another country who are asking if the situation of my family here in our country is still okay.
If it will continue, it is not far for many businesses to leave our country and instead of taking advantage of the capital here in our country, this is going to be afraid to enter our country, an example here is the effect in our country.
Now it continues to rise because the businessmen in our country are slowly losing trust in our country, if it will not be taken away, some big companies will be forced to take their personnel and many will lose their jobs.
Aside from this, there are also many big companies from the United States who did not continue in our country because of the heard events here, it is also not helpful to our country that the destruction of President Rodrigo Duterte to US President Barack Obama.
We know that the United States has long been allies of the United States so it is surprising that Duterte seems to be a fight with the leaders of this, this business that can give thousands of new jobs to our citizens and youth.
If the continuous rise of confidence of businessmen in the Duterte administration will not be stopped, many of our countrymen will lose their jobs and if this happens, many will go to the ranks of hunger in our country.
The Duterte administration should immediately change the view of other countries with us because it's a waste if the growth of our country and every Filipino will stop.
