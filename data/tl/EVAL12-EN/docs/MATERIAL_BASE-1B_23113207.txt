This is the way to politics in Masbate.

"The support I received from the people."
What Father Casas said, he is the "best" of God to believe our fellow countrymen who have a chance to change its frequent fighting for politics in Masbate!
The place in the province of my love, judicial system, has long been allowed to be transferred and changing the hands of evil people who do not care if the liver can be destroyed by their fellowmen because of the greedy men.
Other victims have not seen anything that there is no one, there are suspects who were charged with nothing!
Espinosa, Fernandez, Kho and Lanuan, who among them will refuse that their hands have no blood in politicking in Masbate?
In the coming election, we won't want to judge and Lanting to him, I am just asked to ask you, make us look for you, make sure, what is the shape in the colleges, which is why he is beheaded and Satan?
They are also the same!
Fight or trouble, just fight so that there will be no trouble, or it will only be trouble so that there will be no fight!
Taba, I do not want to choose!
Let's go back to the place, like those who are sensible and common Masangenos that you live in order and are dreaming of a peaceful province of Masbate, that is why I am taking advantage of the new face of politics in my country, which is one of the new faces of politics in my country.
Because a priest of church, Father Leo Casas, agreed to run for office.
A new hope and new chance for Masangenos that I believe that the LP isn't able to respond to Father Casas to run for office.
His real boss is because he felt sorry for Masangenos that he is serving God!!! Amen!
