Sereno appealed for President Aquino, as the new leader of the Supreme Court (Malacanang) to the public to be on guard in relation with the appointment of Justice Ma. Lourdes Sereno, as the new leader of the Supreme Court, the group said that Sereno should not be neglected in the Aquino administration.

Although Sereno made history as the first woman of magistrate, there are questions that are alleged to be questioning in relation to the Malacanang.

If the former member of Renato Corona is said to be in favor of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo because of his voting, he can also say on Sereno, the record of his voting was an indication of his defense, according to Renato M. Reyes, Jr., general secretary of the Bayan.

Aside from being the first decision of Aquino to the Supreme Court, Bayan Patroller has a doubt because according to the distribution of the land in Hacienda Luisita, it is favorable for a higher action of the land for the higher action of the Aquino family.

The Bayan believes that Sereno's opinion on the supposedly just solution for Hacienda is in favor of the family of President Aquino who designated him.

Reyes also said that the issue of the land is possible to be returned to the Supreme Court especially if the difference in low court will not be returned to the Supreme Court, the difference now, said Reyes, the elected magistrates.

"That's why it's only right for the public and farmers to be observant on this issue," said Reyes.

Aside from the issue of civic activities like Hacienda Luisita, the new magistrate will also face the issues of human rights, nature, sovereignty and other issues of the constitutional process.
