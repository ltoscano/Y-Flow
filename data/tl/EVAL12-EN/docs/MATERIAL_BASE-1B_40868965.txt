Ret. Gen. Arturo Cacdac, Jr. and corruption in the PDEA.

It would be better if the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) will go higher in the appointment of Malacanang with Ret. Gen. Arturo Cacdac, Jr., as Undersecretary of said agency in exchange of Ret. Gen. Jose Gutierrez, Jr.

The many issues of corruption are coming out and it became hot when Gadversary will personally talk to the media against the forehead of PDEA chief, Gutierrez.
The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) had a thorough investigation related to the issue involving two officials particularly the alleged P8 million given by the drug suspect.

General Nakar, Sir, only a few of our journalists who are famous in PDEA should have a background check with all agents of PDEA, especially those with luxury cars which can only buy a millionaire.
Maybe it should also be used by a steel fist to be exported back to some of your agents, especially those who plant evidences and have their own.
Also investigate the dismissed members of the two Regional Director and one staff of PDEA.
Hopefully, Ret.
