Give importance to beware of people.

Luhmmmp!

Manila, Philippines - the catholic bishops conference of the Philippines (CBCP) needs to get the attention so that the true spirit of relatives will not be ignored.
Plea by Father Cito, i Garay, executive secretary of CBCP-Eve, Commission on Youth (ECambot), to the parents and the elderly who have the appropriate importance to the Holy Week.
This is due to the time of beware of a vacation where the youth are looking for a hero.
Instead of looking for a full of happiness, it should be given time for 40-day students that started last Ash Wednesday.
The meaning of this is for remembering the suffering, death and the life of our Lord Jesus Christ.
