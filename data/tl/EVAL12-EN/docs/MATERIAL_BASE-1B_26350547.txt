It's a good day when I have read the five cents used in relation to the State of the Nation Address of Pres. Noynoy Aquino on July 28 and it is better for me to answer to your opinion that it is better for me to show that the issues are complicated, but it is better for me to show that the issues are complicated.
If analyzed, you will release all your weapons, which is the reason why you are famous now, weapons, who seem to be an effective motive for you to make sure that they usually do as the comedian - quick comments on the opinion, you are noticing it or not.
And you used the weapons you are in favor with Aquino and against the IDPs, that you have not received money from the controversial DAP, which is why you did not receive money from the controversial DAP, that's why he was able to receive money from the controversial DAP, that's why he / she was able to receive money from the controversial DAP, which is why he left the dirt from the roads. "
Why is it like that?
I do not want to be forest; that is a serious question, that what I want to say is that, there are reasons, those who are asking for money from DAP, the reason why they are not worthy of giving money from DAP, that is why they should not be able to leave for respect, however, they should not be allowed to pass judgement?
I do not want to change your side; it cannot be done by a letter, but you have to study and you are smart, that you have to study and be smart, that you have to assist you so that you will assist you like Kris.
"You would just say properly," for the five puppies, "I am worried that you will find a lot from the Bible because you have not just thought about it or not, you should not just talk about it, and hopefully, you will be sure that you can talk about your declaration.
