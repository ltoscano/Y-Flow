Who is the thief?

President Benigno Aquino III is firm that he was not stole and not a thief in his service, especially in the issue of Disbursement Acceleration Program (Commission on Audit, it is owned by the Office of the Ombudsman and Commission on Audit, which is why they stole the contents of the country's treasury and instead they stole from the funds of the country, causing the country to be buried in poverty.
PNoy cannot identify that he criticized those who served back in the previous administration, he is forcing that he is walking and his personnel at the Tuwid na Daan "yes, they jumped out which is why they rushed the process.
Just like the investigation of the Department of Justice about the P10 billion pork barrel scam, which was led by Janet Lim-Napoles as well as it seems that all people are stupid and believe in the result of the investigation of DOJ because all of the administration were caught in the conducted investigation.
If the investigation is really the same, why did they not carefully investigate the administration who has a connection with Napoles, of course, President Aquino's management is afraid to bury the people involved in stealing public funds.
President Noynoy already knows about the foolishness of people in the government, why did he not make a step to stop it, and there is no proof that he will stop corruption in order to finish the corruption in order to remove the corruption.
It is possible in the heart of President Aquino to fight against corruption in the government but the people around him are not doing anything but to the big percentage of the person who will be put in their pockets, but with the big percentage of the people in sensitive positions in the government, it is possible that President Aquino will not be a thief, but there are people surrounding him that they are doing.
