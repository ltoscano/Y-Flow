DFA and DOLE investigate.

Wanna Bet by Roy "Mamondiong," Seneres (Filipino Star Ngayon), PO 2 4A; UPP-August 21, 2014 - 12: 00am.

When there is the smoke of the fire in Congress to investigate the complaint of 774 OFW, they escaped in Libya where they were able to escape from Libya where they gave them from Libya and Malta to board the Philippine Airlines going home to the Philippines.
There is discrimination for them.
Even though the DFA had paid the US $1.8 million to the owner of the ship, the rooms which are allocated for our countrymen are just being taken away by other race which is why most of them are just on the floor of the boat to sleep.
For us to eat, they will be picked up by four hours and the food and water that is given is not enough.
If these complaints are true, I will not allow the residents of DFA and DOLE to be taken off.
According to RL-842, the "highest concern is" of the DFA and the Philippine foreign services to protect the OFWs.

The Labor laws are ordered by DOLE to protect the OFWs.
That's why, it is brought by two big departments of the government that there are big budget that has obligation to take care of the welfare and protect the OFWs.
I will find out if the $1.8 million worth of the DFA came from the budget or OWWA.
The OWWA should not be blamed for the protection of OFWs because it is the obligation of the DFA and DOLE to protect them, which is why the two said department should be the act.
The OWWA should only be focused on the speed of OFWs and other needs - it is not for the expenses that the government is answering.
