Avoid Road Rage By Sabino, August 28, 2016.
The traffic in Metro Manila is getting more intense, and the lives of our Filipinos are suffering and above.
So avoid being upset with some of our countrymen while driving.
The call here is Road 10, "when he suddenly went dark, the eyes of a driver suddenly went dark, and when he saw a simple heat, he cursed her, and when he was shot, he went down to their vehicles just because of what happened in Quiapo where he was riding in an accident in the road.
How can you avoid Road 10?
1 to give a long journey for the trip so that you will not be in a hurry as often, our head is heating up because when it comes to work or for an appointment.
2 to listen to 2,000 pesos or brook, while driving for a big help for us to be calm, I have to be calm in the internet and this is what I said during the traffic and this is what I've told me, I have learned a lot.
3, let us not bring our problem to the house, if we have a misunderstanding with our husband or children, let us forget it while driving it because if not, let us keep it and the heat in this head can be taken off to others.
4, avoid sleeping late too hot-tempered when we lack sleep and if we are not sleeping, we should avoid driving.
5, avoid coffee or alcohol, especially when we are happy, we are more happy, if we are happy or angry, it is better to avoid them.
And even 6.
