All of us are worried by PNoy and the Estrada?

It seems that the administration of PNoy will eliminate the Estrada family!
They started calling Senator Jinggoy Estrada and recently he was kicked out by the COMELEC, Laguna Governor ER Ejercito.
Aside from this, Manila Mayor Erap Estrada has a pending case of case in the Supreme Court so many are asking if this administration has a plan to erase the name Estrada in politics in the country.
It is noticeable that this government is a bit hot for Estrada because there are many political opponents in the country who also have responsibilities in the government.
It is surprising that the eyes of Malacanang is focused on Estrada that is why the majority strongly believes that Erap is really target.
The Estrada was amazed because instead of fighting and having a hard time, they have the initiative to go down from position to avoid any conflict.
The implementation of Estrada is a heart that is why even if they have not been hit, it is still a person to raise them.
There was a lot that was formed in the election but why was ER Ejercito what they prioritize?
There are a lot of politicians who buy votes and they have bigger expenses on ER but why is the governor of Laguna what they are doing?
Many are now asking if the "Tuwid na Daan" of PNoy is true because it seems that he is just preparing for the opposing parties of the government.
The start of the leadership of the Aquino administration is gross but, in the end, they are really the protector of their corrupt personnel in Malacanang.
Instead of calling for an investigation of their close people, they cleared them that is why the people are already doubting.
It is certain that there will be a lot of events that will happen in the politics of the country, but for sure, this is the only target and it will be taken back to the opposition.
