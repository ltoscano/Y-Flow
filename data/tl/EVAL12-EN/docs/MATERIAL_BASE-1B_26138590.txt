The problem is Si.

It appears that Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima seems to be pissed and an obstacle to what should have been implemented by reform for the Bureau of Customs.
Your servant does not personally know it, Customs Commissioner Ruffy Biazon, but we can see his determination to protect the corruption inside the agency and the Revenue, it will be increased.
However, it seems that Sec. Purisima is stopping or if he will not be delayed because of the approval of the recommendation of Commissioner Ruffy Biazon, especially in the conducted Major-Friends.
On the other hand, let's just send it to Commissioner Ruffy Biazon as if he is one of his rival, who does not know how to take care of it, but he should be calm to Secretary Purisima for any action on the BOC.
Perhaps, it should be better if Sec. Purisima should face the allegation that was thrown at him just like the discontusion of his wealth and even in the truth is that they are not included here?
And it is hard for President Aquino's trust and support of President Aquino to the leadership of Commissioner Ruffy Biazon in implementing reforms in the agency last July, he immediately criticized the BOC on his SONA last July, he was immediately criticized by the President.
Because of our knowledge, Commissioner Ruffy Biazon will not ask his position to the president, the latter himself approached the first to help him clean and finally suppress corruption in the BOC.
Maybe Secretary Purisima should do something to him just to help Commissioner Ruffy Biazon in the agency because he cannot easily get the latter's support because she cannot get the president's support because it's most important to him (Biazon) that's most important to him (Biazon).
