Make an attitude to write a creative mind and creative writing.

Words are free.

Words are the power of power but what is written is to be more powerful, like the bank, you should save so that you can get along well with positive events, changes in life and social activities, it is proof that you are saving yourself towards your progress of mind.

If you want it to be an inheritance for you not to forget the instructions, it would only happen that you want to read this, even if there is an important thing that you want to share to others, even if you do not have an apology, even if you will not be left behind, even if you have not left him / her.

The bird was not contented because he has a music, he was seated because he had a glimpse that he wants to make it to get to know him.

Many are going to end up in the end that everything is too late, before the contents of their minds, the words uttered by the tears, the words that didn't want to write.

If you can't let them listen, you can do the only role that we need to say, but the things we can do to say, but the things that we do not need to listen to the things that we should not forget.

No matter how much you feel, because it is continuing to feel bad for him, until he is not writing the story of his life to read, no one can read the story of his life, so that no one can see her loved ones in life, so that no one can know that our loved ones are in order to imitate or not losing weight.

The great Filipinos are very worried about their lives, each of the information that they have written, a meaningful thing that they have written is a meaningful thing in our hearts to be patriotic and sentences in their pen pals.

Stories and personal stories bring inspiration and skill for the advancement of spirit, needs to be written.

Don't be allowed by the wind and eventually come from the next generation that what you are waiting for, get a paper and convulsion because of writing!
