This is where I pity my money here in Quezon City.
Business.
It was cut off.
Our voice is where I seem to have changed with the elderly so I have changed with my mother with four months that I am tired of living in the Philippines, so I am going to do everything that will happen to my business, I might do everything that will happen to my business.
That is the question.
Woman, do you have a bad business, is it not that big, if that is the capital, you can live together with my aunts because I have five children who are innocent and I have been studying for four years.
Fur.
Four Indonesians, Two Two people are not speaking with different kinds of food because they have a choice.
I was the customers of this, but Ronie was different, but he was in different customer just left his job as Angel, for me to have something like me.
I hope it's because I am like that.

Before, he / she has been paying for a long time so he is still alive within a week.
You are aware, because we are a little bit pitiful; we are close to those who pass through the east of something like that.
It's a bit difficult but there is an increase.
Like a witch.
It seems that in the same age, they are not Filipinos who are trying to get a business, but it is still not a business that you are planning to help here in the province of your older brother that you should have a strong feeling for him to do that there are many people who are going to sell.
