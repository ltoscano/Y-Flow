Reporting, Senator Drilon.

Senator Franklin Drilon has no right to sit as one of the sentiments of the Senate blue ribbon committee in relation to the corruption of the country or pork barrel scam, that is why he should have no right to resign.
If Drilon has not been involved, it is not that Drilon who received 100 million additional pork barrel fund in exchange of voting for the burial of the former Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona during the impeachment trial.
Senator Jinggoy Estrada is still wrong because Drilon's revelation of Drilon is only 50 million, but former Senator Ping Lacson stressed that the issue of Jinggoy is true.
That's why Drilon made a way not to remind the mind of the pork barrel scam, Janet Lim-Napoles, for fear that he / she is hiding more.
The revelations of Budget Sec. Butch Abad led to twenty senators who received millions of funds after the removal of Corona.
The shameless!
Drilon's excuse that he did not push through is more than 100 million from the called Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP).
Just imagine, DAP was still different from PDAF because of the abuse of money from PDAF, what is the call of DAP?
It turns out that it is too much better if politicians will be helpful to the funds of the country, what is worse, the huge money that the crocodile is placed in the mouth of the crocodiles through the knowledge of President Aquino.
The President is the real brain of a famous illustrator of Juan dela Cruz and he is now making a clean "Tuwid na Daan.
It is still up to know that there are more than tons of funds from the government while we have a lot of countrymen who are hungry, dying in different diseases, not able to finish studies and when you earn a little money from poverty.
