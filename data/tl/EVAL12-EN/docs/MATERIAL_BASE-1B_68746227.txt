Make a mind folk and the stunted movie that we have started.

By Rolando Nana, October 10, 2012.

On the midst of Gatid, Khan (Manuel Conde, 1950; on the age of October, 2012.

According to the two companions of my friend, both of their 2020, it seems to be a good thing for their parents, going to success, death of parents, he was considered to have been introduced to the movie Aviation Security Festival last 1952), that it was considered as someone who introduced the movie Abatan of the west-northwest), and remained the copy of it.

There are also three copy of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the toll fee in fact, everybody showed up and took the worst part which became the basis of the widespread brownout in fact, and he turned out to be scratches and a white uniform, and seemingly wearing a white cloth.

The anger and return of the original state to fully understand the style of Manuel Conde in his movie was clear, that it was clear that the image of the protagonist is clear and many of his photos were clear, for all ordinary personnel, and a high-for treatment of the armed men.

Case Kane (Orson Welles, 1941) in the footage but is not really serious because the version of Conde Sousa's life is not serious because it is not only one fiber of history from the giant Fist of Mainaga in fact, but it is naturally not a lesson, the orders of Conde Lima to Khan.

Khan got away with his stronger enemy, which is why the source of money is going to rise and is not worthy of his ownership as a hero, but just like all of a hero, this is only a hero just because it seems that this kind of state would be measured.

The folk which is important is a popular medium of the movie because this is the only pull of the audience for supporting the movie, maybe because of the unforgettable experience and discussion of the story in the movie, it lost hope and happiness in life.

It became more effective, and the viewer would slowly lose in the cinema, but because of the most important price of the cinema, it is not only because of the total price hike for the cinema, and it has been declared that there are six or dozens of titles in the cinema, and it has been declared that there are six or dozens of titles in the cinema, and it has been allowed to be done while watching movies for the middle and to be able to do all the movies in the middle and to be able to do it.

If the masses want to go back to the cinema, this should be reduced to them, just like when they have watched the ordinary viewers to pay for the annual price of Enteng Kabisote and only Ina Mo, and the best person to pay for the ordinary viewers in the cinema.
