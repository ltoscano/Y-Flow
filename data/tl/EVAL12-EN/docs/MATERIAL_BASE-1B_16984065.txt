The LRT was allowed to reach the MRT 3.

Those who are living in Tanay are lucky, especially those who live-in the mountains of Sierra Leone.
Life is quiet, like Tagaytay's climate, the environment will be clear and what you will feel if you are here are the kind of people here, that is why the people here may be famous or not.
It's as if you are in Paraiso, aside from that in "Mountain," as if you are in heaven and you are at the Pacific Ocean, you will be near the Pacific Ocean, you will stay at the Pacific Ocean, Quezon.
The project of former President Fidel V. Ramos is really a big deal, which is why Vic Siman, was really a big thing to the Commission on Human Trafficking.
It is even more that this place will improve if the LRT 2 will push through for now, because, until now, the extension of the CA (Japanese International Criminal Agency) up to CoCs) has a fund, but he has no direct part from our government.
The officials of Rizal and the towns of Antipolo, Barista, Tanay, Hacademic, just like the original plan to continue the LRT 2 to Coyo, just like the original plan to continue the development of the towns of Sierra Leone, Rizal.
Hopefully, Tanay Mayor Lito Tanzanian Fco-workers and Vice Mayor Jimmy Vista, Mayor Junjun Ynares, and DOTC Secretary Jun Abaya, will get ahead of it.
Wait, it turns out that in the length of the line in LRT and MRT stations that the DOTC was able to study the cause of the problem, this is the cause of the high level of facilities and train of MRT / LRT, or, this is caused by the too much number of people riding their train?
It would be good if this is because of the more passengers who were able to board the train, hopefully they will not be taken away because of the length of the line here every week.
