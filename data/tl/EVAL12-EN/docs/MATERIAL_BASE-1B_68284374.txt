It seems that the Palace in Malacanang is saying that the list of those involved in the operation of those involved in the operation of illegal drugs in the country including the so-called narco-ray has been finished for a thorough investigation before they finally take action on this issue.
This is after the announcement of a case of the National Police Commission (Napolcom) against some police who are involved in illegal drug trade in the country.
In filing a case against the so-called narco-CBN, it has been placed under investigation after President Rodrigo "Digong" Duterte, which was said to be filed against President Rodrigo "Digong" Duterte, who was said to be drug addict are Chief Superintendent Bernardo Diaz, Chief Superintendent Edgardo Tinio, and Chief Superintendent Edgardo Tinio.
It is good that the investigation done by Napolcom is finished because many are really waiting for the fate of this case.
We believe it is important that the case will have started against narco-list as well as other personalities who are initially reported to be involved in the operation of illegal drugs in the country to see the sincerity of the government in this fight against illegal drugs.
The case should be has been filed against the accused so it can be found out and there will be a chance for the accused to investigate and release enough evidence to prove that they are clean.
It is more than an unusual argument because it is only the court who can decide if the generals who are involved in illegal drugs are not there, therefore, this issue will push forward to hold the true people living in the country.
