On Oct. 2, 16,212 people watched the fight of Ateneo and La Salle College in the Mall of Asia Arena, last Saturday, many were surprised because of a vacant chair in Araneta Coliseum.
"Is it that because Ateneo will first face the two team, Ateneo won't be in form and lose in a score of 97-81?, is it expected that many did not show up to the" Dome ones because they are expecting that there will be no team that will win in La Salle College now?
We will no longer know the answer to the questions.

Let us just tell that those who are said to be wrong are those who say that Ateneo won the crown to 7995th in its jurisdiction, it is clear that Ateneo did not do anything else, if Ateneo won in the whole world, if Ateneo won't have anything else but their most serious rival.
La Salle coach Alila immediately accepted the blame for the defeat of his team, a defeat that showed up to a team who is ready to fight for the fight.
"I do not know that the children of the children, because if they are having a job, maybe if we are to be a job, I am the one the Whole and of Staff." Because the children, they are able to pay everything.

"What we did is not enough," said Asukal.
Avisado also added that the effect of their 21-year Break is big and said that even in their last practice, the movements of his players are different.
Because of the winning "Ateneo, the third consecutive wins, we make sure that there will be a fight for the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs, or cemented finals, and he also defeated La Salle College while the second is the second until four team in a step to serve the semis.
This is the second time Ateneo made sure that Ateneo won't get complete, it was first done by Ateneo last 2002 when he defeated another La Salle team which is believed to be a pro-ups in their last fight in the said season.
