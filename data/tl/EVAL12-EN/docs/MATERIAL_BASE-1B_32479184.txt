We know: A new champion of sensible and good leadership.
According to August 30, 2016, the whole country reminisced the National Heroes Day or the day wherein we are worried about the sacrifice of thousands of Filipinos to fight for the freedom of our country.
Our freedom was killed several times like during the time of Ianue, where the Filipino soldiers fought against the Japanese in order to achieve the freedom from foreign soldiers by former President Ferdinand Marcos which implemented martial law in our country.
During martial law, thousands of our countrymen are going to fight to defend our freedom, many of them have risked their lives just for the good of all Filipinos but the challenge for every Filipino is also a hero for their simple and simple way.

One example is our help to those who need our society, until now, many of our countrymen are hungry and many of our youth are not able to study.
It's a challenge to us to have the harvest right now through a part of our countrymen who are needy and most of these, we should not let the sacrifice of the thousands of our fellowmen to fight the Marcos regime.
If we will allow the remains of Marcos to be buried in the Libingan ng mga Bayani, it seems that we are saying that the thieves and who will die in our government can be considered as heroes like this kind of attitude and attitude.
This past Saturday night, we have formally appointed the leadership of Vice President Leni Robredo and former Pampanga Gumba. Boss Ed Panaligan, previous champion of sensible and expensive leadership in our country.
They are Mayor Flora Villaros of Siay, Zamboanga del Norte, Mayor Jason Gonzales of Lamberto ao, Iloilo, Mayor Alfredo Marayungan, Surigao del Norte, Councilor Joel Tutok, Surigao del Norte, Councilor Joel Tutok, Iligan City, Councilor Joel Tutok, Olongapo City, Councilor Joel Tutok, Iligan City. Congratulations to all of you!
