Even if Holy Week, the Filipinos did not ask for forgiveness from the message of the President for the occasion, according to the news, to commemorate the suffering and death of Jesus Christ, according to his followers, it seems that we are just being prepared for us compared to Jesus Christ's given? "
The boils of the internet is quick and sharp, even if the well-known critics of the government have not yet promised, it is as if Aquino does not know what to say, and he should not know what the sacrifice will say, and he should be the one to sacrifice.
There are many problems in the statement of Aquino, if they say that the additional burden to the normal trend of life: Those riding the MRT and LRT, for example, is that it is difficult to change the lack of job, and his twin, the lack of decent jobs.
There is also an element of choosing, or accept even if the sacrifice is forced, but many of the mentioned reasons, the sacrifice, "for the citizens, is not clear, but for those who are rich and powerful, he is still caught in the act of making strange reasons," good for the majority. "
Aquino tried to use Jesus Christ for their own benefit so that they will wait for the citizens the current suffering and concern for the people, and even if it is worse in the future of Aquino, he depends on the lack of concern, but more cruelty to the suffering of ordinary people.
That's why it's good news about the refusal of Aquino to the use of Aquino to Jesus Christ, even if the citizens are not blind about any statement that is being endorsed by Aquino to Jesus Christ, even if that is not just that religion, but it is being used by voters, but they are being used by rules in order to prove that they are being used in order.
