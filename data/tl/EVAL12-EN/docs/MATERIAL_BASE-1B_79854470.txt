The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is added to the areas where it is part of the "number of pork barrel scam.
From the former eight main roads, there are 18 more main roads that are going to implement 7: 00 to 7: 00 p.m. number covetous that will be effective in the next week.

Bonifacio Avenue, Rizal Avenue, Del Monte, Marcos Highway, and McArthur Highway.

The jurisdiction of the "Ipit Gang" policy "was formed because of the positive effect of the earlier implemented policy.
The places which are initially implemented by the "tanim bala" policy "are the following: EDSA from Monumento to Roxas Boulevard; C5 Road, from Commonwealth Avenue, Roxas Boulevard, Alabang, Zapote Road, and cities of Mandaluyong, Makati, and Las Pi√±as.
The new plan of MMDA is a sign of success of the agency that the agency has presented to solve the problem of traffic in Metro Manila.
That's why we are giving up the MMDA together with the Metro Manila Council because there are no longer searching for solution to resolve the continuous flow of traffic flow.
We wish for the success of the proposed policy for the benefit of every Filipino people who have long been troubled with traffic.
