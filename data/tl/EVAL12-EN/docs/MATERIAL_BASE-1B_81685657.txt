What do you text what you text earlier about your text.
I was texting me, right why isn't it that I am not okay, I am not okay with me, because I think I am not stupid; and what I think is that I am not stupid; I think that's why I am in the same number.
A while ago, that's why you didn't answer back then, I am not answering; what you are doing now is not only here outside what you are doing now that we have not just arrived and we are just sitting here in the house.
Who came.
Ah, we are very pitiful; we might come from we came from here.
It came that there was a text message of my cousin who came from there, what kind of sibling, who was my sister-in-law, whose legs are low.
"Me, my sister-in-law, do you know how are you, brother of Ramon, not his aunt.
Stay here in the house.
Just wait, we, at the age of us, we have to go here at around twelve o'clock; we just want to wait at around twelve o'clock; we want us to go to Manila from Manila from Manila from Manila.
Tomorrow, is there really there?
I do not know maybe we are still here in the morning.
Covetous, fur.
Yes to all the height of this.
