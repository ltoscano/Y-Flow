Senator Villanueva?

Villanueva for NPC.
We were surprised by Secretary Joel Villanueva when he suddenly visited the National Press Club two days ago in the afternoon.
There is no goal, but regards to his friends in the media.
It was found out that the coming candidacy for the Senate was discussed but became silent.
His mouth is said to have thought about that.
Jackpot.
It is like PNoy won't win a lotto to get Joel Villanueva as the secretary to lead TESDA.
It can be considered that the graft case to the Arroyo administration will be successful and beneficial to our small citizens as well as an Overseas Filipino worker.
There are so many people who have been able to give assistance to TESDA to enter a proper job.
In short, this is the right path of Secretary Joel Villanueva.
Villanueva in the Senate?
It is only one advice that ultimatum at Sec. Villanueva is only one advice, in case he is a as a person who ran it in the coming 2013 period the elections.
At 2,000 up to 90 percent, his assurance with the victory happened, which is happening!
When 70 percent down and down, just think about it.
Why, Bro?
It will be better if you continue to continue the public service for the 2016 we are tired of this, and it is definite that his popularity is ripe for the ability and loyalty in his duty to the people.
Just an advice!
Part of course.
Not unknown to everyone who has a big number of Jesus is the Lord who can be considered the political backbone of the Villanueva.
In the number of 3 million more voters, this is really a big contribution for the leader of the administration.
Will this be considered by President Noynoy Aquino?
