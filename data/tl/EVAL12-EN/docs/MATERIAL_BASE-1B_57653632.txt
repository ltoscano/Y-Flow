Smell: Contract and drugs.
By Al G. Mendoza, September 23, 2016 is the contract between the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) and the coaches and athletes.
This is to make sure that the real and non-shaped like the athletes.
Add to that the chest, covetousness of the athletes who are under their training as well as the colleges of the coach and athletes should finally be forgotten.
Whoever violate the rules just to stop the giving of a covetousness of the cowards or athletes.
If it is proven that there is a serious violation of El Nino, it can be a basis to remove the national training with coach or athletes.
Next is the proclamation of the drug test of the same coach and athletes.
That is okay.
That should be implemented before.
Recently, there is an operation that will be positive for drugs and immediately removed the athletes, who are also members of the Philippine Navy.

There is a contract and drugs that will be focused on by Butch Ramirez, the will return to the PSC chairman.
As to why the two rules in the past administrations were not implemented yet.
I feel that Ramirez will emphasize the implementation of the issue of contract and drugs.
It is time for the leadership of PSC to have meaning for the welfare of the Philippine sports.
We said, it's too late and good, I will rush it.
