They are alive at Libingan ng mga Bayani, August 30, 2016), there are no classes because of the National Heroes Day, this is the day when we celebrate our heroes.
One of the lives of the heroes is Noel Villapando and his companions at the Suzuki Cup, Mike Navallo.
At the Libingan ng mga Bayani for me, they save the life of those who are applying to their father, mother, and his children who have listened to them yesterday, and from listening to Noel, our neighbors learned a lot to avoid accidents.
A riding-riding-riding in the past administrations were able to renew their contract on the Land Transportation Office.
Hopefully, Noel and the Suzuki Cup will have a chance to continue being a hero just by teaching a riding-riding with a lot of lives which can be saved, and the right to be taught is the right to be able to ask for the right way to be able to ask for the right way to achieve our countrymen.
I am thankful to Gentle Castillo of the Suzuki Philippines for the contribution of our doctor for a riding-riding a seminar in our area.
President Rody Duterte got angry when there was a noisy motor when he went to the wake in Antipolo recently, and because of this, he ordered to catch the LTO to catch the motorcycles that would be distributed.
May this serve as a warning to everyone to remove their motorcycles and make it as a simple arrogance, it might end up a heavy punishment.
