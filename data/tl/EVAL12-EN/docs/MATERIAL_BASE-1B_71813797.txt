Drug money from ARNC.

It is an estimated drug lords and drug money every time the election is coming in our country, especially here in AOIL Region in Muslim Mindanao where there are allegedly some drug lords who are direct with business with our police and PDEA who have long been problems of our police and PDEA.
It is also not new to see the residents who are joining the local officials and high-Men such as AFP and PNP for people who are known as those involved in selling illegal drugs in the region because of the protection given to them by their buddies.
In holding an election, there is a pile of big expenses for the candidates but others have a sign of winning even a bit of money from the residents and being the same in socializing with people.
But the most painful is that the drug lords will get the nomination of the Liberal Party in some towns here in ARNC and they were not able to give funds to choosing their candidates.
In Bukidnon, Senator Teofila Guingona strongly denied that they chose one candidate for the presidency in their province, hopefully this is what a few leaders of the Liberal Party promised to restore the nomination of the people involved in our society because our belief is that the path is not included with the people involved in society.
PDEA and other agencies of the government should not be acquitted in suppressing illegal drugs even during the time of the election to show the people who have something to do with the power of local officials in their race which should be put under the mold before being executed in Rizal Park.
