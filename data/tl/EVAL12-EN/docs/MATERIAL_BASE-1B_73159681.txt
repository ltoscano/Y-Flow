Task Force TSETC.

The movement of Malacanang is very lonely for the last shouting of their ownership of the Philippines - an exchange of exchange of face-face-to-face, no one is talking about it!
Many of the accomplices of PNoy were complained about the robbery but until now, each has been on their throne while waiting for the decrease in the throne of PNoy in 2016.
But the chief of Task Force Tugonon said that P / Senior Superintendent Conrad Capa is still in peace with the dark why he was suddenly fired from his throne after he was arrested by the Philippine Bureau of Investigation (NBI), which is why the nose of NBI deputy directors that the nose of NBI deputy commissioner Rey Espontes, and Jumuad.
If Colonel Capa is said to be a promotion is what is done by someone to check up, well for the NBI, he will be removed except if the two of them will be done by the NBI director.
Many have been fired by PNoy since he served in Malacanang but it is clear that he is being fired by his accomplices in foolishness.
Or, now, what is the good thing to do?
To get stronger to TF-gambling, encourage some sectors of society who are full of foolishness of the group of PNoy but do not bring the three customers.
The primary goal is for PNoy to rise up together with his accomplices like Paquito, Panchand act as if they were able to go back to Miss Gloria.
They entrust your cauldron which is the source of the food of your family so it is just right for you to attack their cauldron! Let us see the stubbornness of PNoy if he is not in the throne!
