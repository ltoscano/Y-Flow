Thank you and the T'boli police.

It is sad to think that it has been two years before the May 2016 election, but politics started to be hot in the city of Caloocan.
Why, why?
Well, in a few days of past, Mayor Oca Malapitan presented.
As a resident of Caloocan who is happy with what is happening now in the city, this is a clear defamation to the Aquino administration.
In the cness, Mayor Orca is working, "that is our belief and more than 200,000 people voted for him last election.
If there are some who are not happy with the good deeds of the broken city of the city, these are his opponents in politics.
What would be the reason for the people who are not happy with Orca but to defamation and "that is what is being done in the current leadership of the city.
Mayor Orca is trying to get the kind of dirty politics in Caloocan but the people are slowly getting into their lives.
To be bad for the image, the enemies of the text Brigade were launched to spread negative comments against the administration of Malapitan.
But Mayor Orca should not be sent to a black propaganda to have started in Caloocan, "will not be happy.
Similar to a tree, the mayor is full of fruit, therefore, it is being thrown away but we think you are being thrown!!
Because we believe that if a leader is good, no matter what kind of defamation to do to him, he will not succeed.
Just like the past years, Orca is the target of extreme defamation but those from Caloocan are not believed and are not shaken.
Because when it comes to election day, he is supported and chose most of the voters of the city.
Now, the defamation are already felt, but many residents of Caloocan believe in it, "Can-A good luck."
What he is taking on the road is right, so we think, "Taba Can-A Mayor Oca Malapitan."
