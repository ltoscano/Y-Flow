Service is free.
August 3, 2016 was the emergency line of the government because of the price of those who complained about 911 and 8888.
This is the scenario of Civil Service Commission (CSC) on the first day of the launch of the National emergency 911 and senior citizen complaint against the national emergency line 8888.
According to CSC Chairperson the Alicia Police, a few call received by the call center agent of 911 and 8888 were suddenly lost, and one of the reasons being seen is already a problem if this is happening to our countrymen who have launched an emergency line.
The good intention of our government to answer the needs of our countrymen is a waste if there is a scenario.
That's why for us to become beneficial, the program launched by the government should be beneficial.
It is not right to collect payment for the national emergency 911 and senior citizens under the international line 8888 because it is contrary to the PNoy that the Duterte administration wants to send.
In our opinion, it is not for five in English to be delivered to the yellow line number of the government because it is part of public service that is why it should be free.
