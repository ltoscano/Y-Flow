100 days are held by Eve with the Kotong P-RA)?

Is the goal of the former President and now Manila Mayor Joseph "Erap" Estrada to clean Manila from illegal gambling and to Kotong P?
It is almost over 100 days that Mayor Erap has given the personnel of Manila Police District (MPD) in connection to the citizens of the Manila Police District (MPD) in relation to the KCOP and illegal gambling dens but until now, it is not enough for them to extort, and their personnel, MPD Director, Chief Supt. Isagani Genabe, Jr.
It is true that General Isagani Silva will not be accepted away from the cunning and operators of gambling but the station commanders are not able to deny the arrival or when the vendors are not able to save the Lupit, officials of MPD and even the Manila City Hall.
Estrada is trying hard to try not to make the livelihood of the vendors in different places and crowded places in his jurisdiction but it is really natural for those who are seated in position and are benefiting because there is a possibility that Erap and Isagani Genabe will possibly remove them from position.
There is a severe harassment done by some station commander in the vendors, when they cannot remove them from their goods and, the cruel, together with the number of those who were not able to give it to the streets that they have been paying for their services to the police, which are all spent on their services to being a collector.
Even during the time of former Manila Mayor Fred Lim, they have to go to district director, now that the mayor is still on top of them.
Well, is there no end to their luck in life?
And if it is true that he is mad at General Garbo in gambling, why is it that he has been seen to be an ally, he can stop Metro Manila if it is just about illegal gambling dens but is it true, General Garbo?
