The fight!

Every person has its own cross again!
In the area of Pandian, Thailand, I met one band that is called Philipines band, which is composed of four Filipina, she told me how much he is going through with his loved ones.
According to Beth, he remembered his work when he was in the Philippines and even his wife is also a member of the other hand, he said that this is their livelihood.
"I really had a long time ago in Manila to transfer since 1986 in 1991," he said.
But, even if they do not have hard work and perseverance to do, it seems that the money they earn is not enough to live properly and their family will be peaceful and peaceful, especially their children.
This is allegedly the reason why he will be given a chance to work in Thailand as a boils, he immediately accepted it even if there is a little doubt because of the wife and children who are left.
According to Beth, one of the reasons why she decided to leave the country is to help his father who has a heart disease.
"" My father, got sick, "he did not have a job," he added.
In more than two years of staying inside where he met, a lot of challenges came to her because she felt too much loneliness while he was in the land of the colonizers.
"I am an only one in my living room, my children, I am all hoping that I am going to go home but I have no plan to go home but I have no savings," he said.
At the end of my interview with Beth, I could really feel the loneliness that she is carrying in her chest.
Many of us are thinking that if you work in a different country, you will be sure that the success in the fight of life is certain, but unknown to our knowledge, there is a new challenges that we will face and poverty because life is a new battle and struggle.
