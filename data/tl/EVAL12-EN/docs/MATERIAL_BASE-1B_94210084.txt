For The record, the failure can't be made up.
There are 6, 2016 Northeastern this period of campaign to discredit the past of a candidate.
But even if we say that this is part of defamation, I believe it is important for everyone or the voters to know the background of a candidate to ensure that his decision is right in voting.
Just like a candidate for the vice mayor in Manila, Honey Florentino, that it is not far for his campaign to be buried in spite of her father, former Manila Vice Mayor Danny Kurdi, in spite of her father, former Manila Vice Mayor Danny Itlog, in spite of her father, former Manila Vice Mayor Danny Itlog, in spite of her father, former Manila Vice Mayor Danny Itlog, in spite of her father, former Manila Vice Mayor Danny Constantino earlier.
Aside from that, the leadership of this is also not good at the Manila Boystown Complex and Manila Development Assistance Center (Special Center.
Because the name of the child Federico Bongay in Manila PC that was very thin, bones and skin are sleeping and being ill-tempered, no matter how much.
Aside from Macabato, another baby boy was also killed in the care of the Boystown Complex of the Manila Department of Social Work (MDSW) in Marikina City where are Honey Magalona from the chief before.
There was also a shooting incident in an 11-year-old man with an 18-year-old man in RA C, there was a blackout that was hidden in the media and Honey who was also a chief before.
The escape of the 11 youth at the Boystown Complex because of the alleged hidden treatment of them inside the agency and complaints of the families on the street that was brought to the Boystown Complex of the alleged treatment towards them and like an animal, is under the management of Honey.
That is why it's just like that, most of those in Manila are doubting the ability of Honey to become vice mayor because of the questionable ability of the management of some department, how will he do in Manila if Vice Mayor win?
