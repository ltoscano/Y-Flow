A barangay hall with making noise.
Bira Yagit, October 28, 2016.
There is still no final decision on who the barangay chairmen, after the official assigned in the barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) election this October 31, the present year.
Prior to this, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) has the desire to sweep the current barangay officials who are involved in illegal drugs and they really have to be replaced with them.
.
It is true that this report is really thankful that's why it is only right to release a mandate or law that are being driven out of all elected barangay officials in their position, especially those who are involved in illegal drugs.
But if he is sensible, there is no record that there is a connection with the operation of illegal drugs, give a chance to continue his services.
Because of the suspension of the barangay and SK elections, many elected chairman were pleased because they will remain in position and equivalent to their stay in power is what they want to continue illegal activities.
That is why how they rushed the proposed bill to suspend the barangay election, it has already been released by the order that will be given to the elected barangay officials.
It's because it's just like the corrupt barangay chairmen, whether in spite of being with making decisions because of the involvement on illegal drugs, they have given a right to stay in position.
I believe that staying at the custody of barangay officials who are involved in the operation of illegal drugs will be the hindrance to resolve the Duterte administration's best to clean the country on illegal drugs.
