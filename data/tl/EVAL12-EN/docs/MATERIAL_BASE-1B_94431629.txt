Bulacan People's Day, 2 and SCollector Dela.

After we publish.
Mister Burleson, not only every Monday we are fooled by Alvarado, but also on Tuesday, Vice Governor Daniel Fernando Poe is being used.
Carrying the bundle of money (equivalent to twenty pesos), Vice Gov. let us be together for us to send her help to us.
God, and Joseph, make sure that she would be able to treat their Bulos City as well as his son Governor Alvarado and Vice Governor Fernando Poe?
Which is the amount of twenty pesos that they will give to every person their help is for them to treat them!
I repeat, Mr. Alvarado and Mister Fernando, what you need to look at is the programs or projects of your administration how to improve their livelihood!
It's not what you are doing that it seems that they are going to be the country especially in poverty and will just buy coins every Monday and Tuesday.
Because you have been made to look like the people from Bulacan.
In fact, even if you will feel pain and stupidity of your brain, you can't think that you can't think of being a person for them.
Even if you are not giving coins every "New People's Day" in Bulacan, and even if you are no longer united and those who are from Bulacan will be united.
Just don't just ignore it, steal or get tired of going to Bulacan, it is certain that this will have a good effect on them and their livelihood.
But even if you have not given coins, there will be no effect if they continue to prove that the money of Bulacan is nonstop and nonstop.
As they say, you do not need to be good.
Just do not fool you!
