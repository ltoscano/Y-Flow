The religion and an OFW in abroad.

Even if we are not religious, if he goes to abroad and just alone, only praying and strong faith in God is what they are holding.
Especially to the First Division, many are playing in their minds before leaving the Philippines.
Of course they do not know what kind of culture there is a country that they will go to.
Everyone will only answer this when he comes to his destination, but despite the fear that it will happen, he will be able to endure for the sake of the dreams that he wants to fulfill, for the sake of the family that he wants to get along with.
But to our Filipino, men or women, their belief and faith that there is an activity that can be considered as integrity in their abroad, cannot be removed.
The religion is a form of deceitful people to find the big difference between people with animals for animals, because they do not have a need on the issue of worshiping you.
Even if it is said that an OFW is not active in his religion, we have talked to someone who became closer to God when he comes abroad.
There is a diligent study in the Bible, tried to find out what is really being pointed at the Bible and in the end, he offered herself to serve the Lord who was recognized in the Bible, and what is the way towards safety.
He felt uneasy for some friends and relatives to focus on the Bible and know the truth instead of going to a few religious tradition and ritual caused by them to understand what he wants to say.
That is also a good effect of going abroad to our countrymen so they are looking for it and they are brought back to our Creator.
But one official of our embassy who said that he is losing a religion when he / she gets buried abroad, why are you?
Hey, all religions, she invited him, and she is obliged to attend because they are just using these kinds of opportunities to talk to our Filipino community.
