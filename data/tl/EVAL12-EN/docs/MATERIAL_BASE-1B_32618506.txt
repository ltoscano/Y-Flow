Cooperation between the Binay-INTECAYETANO!

The fight of Binay and Grace Poe is almost the same.
If in the race of the horse, this fight will be held this end of 2014.
If Grace Poe has become weak against the declared Binay for President in 2015, the bad outcome of the next presidential election will happen again?
The majority felt nervous.
Like his father Fernando Poe, Jr. who has been thinking for a long time if he will run for President, as well as the fear of people pushing for the candidacy of Grace for President.
In the moment he agreed to be a candidate for the presidency, it is likely that his enemies are not going to take a stinky mud to his enemies in politics.
What will be the issue against him?
But the enemies of Grace will surely think about the issue against FPJ's son.
Grace's opponents are restless.
Someone is whispering to the true father of Mrs. Grace, the deceased Ferdinand Marcos, and his mother is a relative of Susan Roces.
If Grace is the Vice President, Bongbong Marcos will be the vice president or Vice President. "That is the new Marcos dynasty," said others.
And if ever Grace agreed to be a candidate for President, he will be replaced with his citizenship because he is often in America than the Philippines.
The American citizenship is also being thrown at him when he is a candidate against Gloria, he will surely be relieved and there might be a sign that he will be held accountable for him.
And the more dangerous events, if Noynoy will choose Binay and not Grace Poe, EP / Raul VALNAs.
