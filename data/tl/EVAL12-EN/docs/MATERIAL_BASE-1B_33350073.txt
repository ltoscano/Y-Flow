Campaign versus corruption will be gone to waste if there are no Whishaw in the lower Protection Program BE with Loza-Cudia last August 28, 2016.
The catholic bishops conference of the Philippines (CBCP), the campaign of President Rodrigo Duterte will have no meaning against the corruption when the Whishaw in the lower Protection Act hasn't been released.
In line with this, Manila contestants are appealing to Bishop Broch Guillo, chairman of the commission of the Minority Floor of the Congress and the Senate to implement the Whishaw in the lower Protection Program.
It was found out that Pabillo was worried about the decision of the Sandiganbayan who is guilty in the NBP-ZTE.
It is time to give a big protection to the lower ranks so that more will come out and fix the corruption in the government.
"There is no protection that those who show themselves, which is why we need to be given protection if we really want to fight corruption, but we really saw that there is something wrong there, but according to the Bishop in the interview of Bombo Verde-.
The Bishop said that the effect of Lorena Rodriguez has no meaning of stopping him with multimillion pesos.
Pabillo also expressed doubt on the timing in the decision given to LoD by that will cause a bad example and warning to those who want to reveal corruption in the government.
The Bishop is hoping that Lorena Drilon will be strong and his support to him by the people will not be lost because of what he has done.
