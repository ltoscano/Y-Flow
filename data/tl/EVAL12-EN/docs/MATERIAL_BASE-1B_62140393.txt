There are increasing number.

It seems that Malaca√±ang has not reviewed what Malacanang is saying that the economy of the country is improving the state of ordinary people.
It is clear in the survey conducted by the Social Weather Station that more than 3 percent of the poor will increase this year if they are compared to the data of said survey firms in held on the 3rd division last year.
It is obvious that up to 55 percent of the poor are really moving and this is just a proof that the Aquino administration has a proof of the resolution of the poverty of his citizens.
Malacanang cannot deny that 12.1 million Filipinos who are poor in the present are an indication that their campaign and project against poverty is not enough, just like the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program or CCT.
PNoy needs to change his policies against poverty and maybe he should also be considered the firing of Dinky Soliman as leader of the DSWD because it seems that he did not have done his job in spite of the so much funds allocated by the government.
