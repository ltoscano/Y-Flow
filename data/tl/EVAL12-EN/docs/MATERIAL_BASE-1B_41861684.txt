Don't.

The Barangay election is important for me, so during this time, I am active to encourage the people to choose properly and vote for the leaders of the barangay.
The Barangay election is near.
That's why I am eating again the importance of election this October 28, 2013.
If before, some of us do not pay attention to this election, now, they should always be taken away and should not be taken away.
It should be important to all of us because the barangay has its own budget from the country's treasury and powerful.
It is just needed not to stay and take care of politicians to run, but are professionals, people and those who would be proven guilty.
As a former councilor of the city, I am always proud of Barangay Roxas in Quezon City.
The candidates of barangay officials are heavy.
Qualifications are intense so the fight in the election is good.
The captain was a lawyer, KimXi. Marcos Estrada.
The members are all professionals like DDoctor Tata Golovkin, Engineer Clarence Lopez, Atty. Mar Lalin, a businessman too.
One member of Atty. Niño Casimiro is also a barangay councilor.
I am impressed by the young barangay councilor.
Even though he / she can file the amount of huge martial law, he chose to serve them in their barangay.
Roxas is always news when typhoon because the streets are often flooded here near the river.
If the leaders of the barangay are like Atty. Niño Casimiro and we have hope that the corruption will be erased in the level of barangay.
We hope that a good governance is only in the barangay level.
So, to those who have been arrested, hopefully in our barangays, there are those who supported us like Atty. Niño Casimiro.
The barangay is important and we should put all the people you will trust, good and has conviction.
