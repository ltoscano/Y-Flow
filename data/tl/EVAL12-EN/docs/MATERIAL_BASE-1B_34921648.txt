You will go back and return.

ER Ejercito should not end up in the position of ER Ejercito as the governor of Laguna because if the problem will not be resolved, the problem would not be resolved, it seems that the problem is like a ghost that is like a ghost and forth every election.
The issue is being monitored because the ER used a lot of money for his campaign.
It is a big scandal but if you think about it, it can be said that this kind of politicians are not common.
If we remember, something has been revealed in the media then about the evidences gathered and proves that all the senators who run in the election are over their campaign and violate the campaign fund of the COMELEC.
But why is there no case yet, no one has been victimized, according to the law, only P5 for every voters should be the expenses of a politician in his campaign.
They multiply very much from the number of people in a place, TV Patrol, and radio advertisement.
The only difference in the case of Governor ER Ejercito is the complainant against him, according to the news, he allegedly received evidence for the excessive spending of the Supreme Court last election.
But who is not too much spending during election?
ER went down properly so there will not be trouble but he promised to return again.
ER Ejercito will lead to visit all the cases when the politicians are in favor of their expenses?
If you will become a year, the case of ER might give a proper way to make the COMELEC (Commission on Elections) if this is still practical due to the price hike which will be implemented, if it is still practical.
If we want our politicians to be honest in the campaign of our politicians, put the most candidates for all candidates to not follow the order of the law.
Hopefully, all of the candidates should be called for if one of the candidates spent the campaign and according to the law so that the issue will not be back and forth.
