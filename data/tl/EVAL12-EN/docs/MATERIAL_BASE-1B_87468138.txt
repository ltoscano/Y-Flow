Rice, and water.

We sympathize with the QC Council in passing the "epal.
For me, this is a short-year-old points for Mayor Bistek Bautista, Vice Mayor Joy Belmonte and the entirety of the city council.
Because of the ordinance, the "Tuwid na Daan" will be allowed to order and instead of being a one full order and cannot be denied that the restaurants in the city would not refuse, they will just be able to resist the "Suzuki Cup which is only their customers.
The ordinance has a severe issue because there is a severe issue now for the lack of rice and a bit expensive because according to the International Rice Respiratory Syndrome), it is also a 23 million peso worth of rice everyday.
The "
Because before, the Philippine Cup of rice can't be ordered to order the restaurant so that if they are not paid the orders of rice, these are just wasted and are just wasted now because of the ordinance.
Congratulations to the QC Council.
And because we are also here in the issue of avoidance, hopefully it will also be done to the ordinance that water should be held today if those who eat are asking for it.
And should be asked if a few glasses of water should be eaten so that it will be the only to present.
We can see that water without drinking is wasted.
We can see that sometimes there are many glasses of water that were left on the table when those who eat at the restaurant will leave.
Sometimes, they were not able to move and the glass was still full of leaves.
And we know that water is also an issue because of the threat of lack of supply.
If there will also be an ordinance to control the using of water, it will be more beautiful.
We thank the action of the QC Council regarding this, and perhaps, they will focus on the issue on water to drink.
