You sold it?

The report of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) is happy that the recent elections in the barangay is happy.
There are some reports of violence that need to be identified if it has something to do with the election.
But what is trying hard to improve the news about the election is the incidents of buying votes.
Many are surprised, as if now, it is too late for the stories of newspaper, TV and radio to buy votes in the barangay level.
And the price hike!
There are news that there will be P1,000 in a vote, around 800 pesos, P400 and 100 pesos.
Just think about it, to the smallest barangays who only need 200 votes to win, if he will buy 20 thousand pesos, he needs 20 thousand pesos to enter or win as one of the seven members.
A number of 20 pesos in a poor barangay is very big that is why there is a report that there is a price hike for a few.
One more thing, this is prohibited!
Even if he won, there is always fear that he was disqualified when he saw the violation of the law in the election.
More than the news will be bigger that P1,000 will reach a barangay in the province of Mindanao, tsk.
Just like this.
Some of the people I talked to, insisted that they did not sell their votes.
In one of the barangays in my district in QC, the voters that I know are to vote for because their candidate will come back then and I was able to give them a job even more.
But with the many stories about the vote buying, this kind of work is becoming famous.
Saddening.
But I do not believe that this illness has no medicine.
I have extended my suggestion to the COMELEC to fix and implement the process of a certificate of certificate so that somehow they can fix the very big "wrong" it is wrong. "
Let us not accept it.
Hopefully there are some who are in power to be serious in making this wrong path every election.
