Governor, Alvarado - the PERNC in Batangas.

With the number of those who have talked to Bulacan, they have one tone.
That they do not want to leave Governor Alvarado because they are disgusted with the reports of borrowing money.
They pointed the many comments of COA regarding suspicious transactions in Bulacan where the last was the percent of the province from the amount that the Small Town Lottery has paid.
We are just asking you, Governor, Alvarado, what projects can be done in Bulacan who will be imposed from the STL?
If there is something, why are people from Bulacan do not know?
How much was the act of Bulacan from the millions worth of the STL?
If there is something, why don't the COA don't know?
The truth is, Gays, I was very small while I was cursed by my friends because according to them, it's as if you did what you did!
They were about to look into a thief, greedy, liar and various hurtful words to what I've said, and even wanted to defend, I can't do anything.
Because they are from Bulacan who often feel classes in your service and personality.
In short, they are the ones who know if you are a thief or not!
In fact, according to what I have talked to, he said, no matter how much you carry, you will never vote for you!
God, and Joseph, you should be prudent! You are just a nuisance, right, you will return to your governor?
It is, tolerating his case, isn't it?
