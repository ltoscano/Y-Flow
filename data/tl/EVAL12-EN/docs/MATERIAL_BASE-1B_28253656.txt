ABS-martial law and Marcos are out of Martial Law.
Raymond B. August 12, 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte is known for being ill-tempered and firm that is why it is not surprising why he got annoyed with Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, she said that she might be forced to dictate the Martial Law.
The threat of Martial Law by President Rody is the root of the statement of the magistrates who might have the Constitutional crisis because the President is involved with the eight judge in illegal drugs and he even called them as narco-judges. "
Sereno said, which is not the investigation of the Philippine National Police (PNP), the Philippine National Police (PNP) should not be investigated by the Supreme Court (RTC) Branch 13; Judge Casiple, Kalibo, Aklan; Judge Ricardo Gonzales of Quezon City; Judge Casiple, Kalibo, Aklan; Judge Ricardo Gonzales of Police Regional Trial Court (MPD); Judge Ricardo Gonzales of Municipal Police Regional Trial Court (MPD); Judge Casiple, Kalibo, Aklan; Judge EpiPen.
If examined by Duterte's statement about Martial Law, he did not directly tell the martial law in case the Martial Law would be said to have been said by CJ Sereno in the Constitutional crisis.
It is also important to look at the approval of Duterte's statement because he was facing the soldiers of the 45th Infantry Division (ID) of the Philippine Army (PA) that resulted to the injuries and death of some soldiers.
President Rody himself went to the camp of their ID in Cagayan de Oro City to visit the wounded soldiers and sympathize with the family of the deceased soldiers.
Senator Panfilo Lacson believes that the statement of Duterte on Martial Law is only brought by Duterte's stubbornness, especially when he is decided on his plan like war against illegal drugs.
"
I do not know what will be the reaction of President Rody by the former President and dictator Ferdinand Marcos in the Libingan ng mga Bayani.
