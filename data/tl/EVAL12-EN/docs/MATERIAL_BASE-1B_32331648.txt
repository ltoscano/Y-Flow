The contribution of Ka Greg are also unique and not only in taking advantage of the unexpected spirit of the masses and the masses in the field of armed struggle, improvement of the livelihood of the people, and strengthening their organization.

The highest form of giving recognition to the most loved ones is the continuation of what they are left with, our strength and intelligence from the revolutionary activity that is temporarily stopped caused by their grief towards the advancement of the revolution.

Our martyr is the image of a simple lifestyle and full struggle for the welfare of the people of Sorsogon which should be given inspiration to the citizens of Sorsogon to make them as a model for the children of Ka Nel and Ka Kevin, which can be given a lot by women in freeing the society and their sector.

Concentration to the types of sectors who are oppressed which is being raped by the society will be the powerful force to agree with the corruption of the current administration, the guidance of the Liberal Party of the Philippines, who will build a new society who is truly free, fair, and progressive.

Surrender the revolution!
