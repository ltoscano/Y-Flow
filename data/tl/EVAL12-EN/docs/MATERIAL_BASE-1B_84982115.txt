A new year... there was a new generation that occurred with a new life,: Reflection of 1st week of Adamyear-A, 2013.

A new year... there is a new life that happens again, for our fellow countrymen who are currently serving in our country, but it is not easy for us to make peace with our hearts, which is why we know that we are going to take peace with our hearts, which is why we know that this is a new hope that we need to take care of our hearts, which is why we know that there is a new hope that we need to take care of our hearts, which is why we know that we are going to take peace of our hearts, which is why we know that there is a new hope that we need to take care of our hearts, which is why we know that we are going to take peace of our hearts, which is why we know that there is a new hope that we need to take care of our hearts, which is why we know that there is a new hope that we need to take care of us!
