What should be done with Ebola?

In case the illness of Ebola is coming to us, what are the things that we are going to do?
For those who join again at the airport and their operation, their fellow countrymen and foreigners will come, these are being observed.
If there is a symptoms of Ebola, they can easily take action through the quarantine.
But what if the disease is inside our house because it is only then that Ebola inside the two to three weeks will be discovered.
Of course, we will call a doctor (or faith in far places) or let us go to the nearest clinic in Barangay health center or hospital, and whatever happens after this.
Of course, it is there that the relatives, who are prohibited to come near, relatives, are prohibited to celebrate the patient with other patients, to be set up.
The only thing that is not allowed is the excessive spending of the doctors to buy medicine for the judicial system which can be achieved by doctor because doctor is a commission of them. King-mother!
It is also prohibited to ask for help from the Municipal Social Welfare and Development if you have already met a patient who will ask for help from the same year. King and mother again.

So, if someone has Ebola?
For those who are from Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia which has Ebola and almost thousands have died, the whole family of the disease is dead.
It's because their attitude is, like us, to fix the corpses and those who have returned with kisses and thin with their contact with blood, sweat, semen and other liquid of patient, which is the cause of their contestant.
Now, make sure that because of the fear of those who lost a place, they would just throw the dead on the road or just leave it wherever they are relatives and it is up to the dead to bury his own.
Whatever it is, make sure that what we will do?
