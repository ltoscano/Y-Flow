ER in the Philippines.

I don't remember that politicians get removed from their position because of the "Tuwid na Daan" but Laguna Governor ER Ejercito.
According to the Comelec, Ejercito is prohibited by their prohibited "Tuwid na Daan" in the past May 2013 election.
This command of Gerl was commendable because after many years of implementation of the election, someone violated said law.
And it is very unlucky that COMELEC caught the violation of the case that they are saying is Ejercito.
It is unlucky because due to the number of violating this law, he was the one caught and now he is running away.
If the looming martial law would not be implemented, it is certain that only a few senators will be killed, congressmen, governor and mayor.
Perhaps, Gov. ER did not get to work for the spending of his campaign fund, that's why he never thought that his opponent was peeking.
Because of the report, the opponent in the politics of Governor ER was placed around the COMELEC with evidences that caused his removal.
In the other hand, he does not need to amend the body of a long time to gather evidence so that he will be forced to the said case.
On the own mouth of Chairman Sixto Brillantes, it is said that there are several cases that they are investigating about the politicians who prioritize the expenses for election.
But because the complainant met and complained about the evidence, the reason why the case was last was long and later on, it was never caught by reports.
Chairman Brillantes is right now that they need the help of those who will take advantage of the complaint to remove those who violate the illegal looming martial law.
Because of the complaints, more people know what is happening outside during the campaign period.
In our country, there are so many politicians who use a lot of money on money to buy votes and win.
He has many "ER" in the Philippines, "that is the truth.
