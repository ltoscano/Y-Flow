The way for campaign season.

The start of the campaign against those running in Barangay election last Friday would be expected, especially the main roads in Metro Manila and even in the provinces.
In relation to this, Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Chairman Francis Tolentino is asked to prohibit the set campaign on these roads in EDSA, C-5, Quezon Avenue, Shaw Boulevard, Araneta Avenue, Shaw Boulevard, Araneta Avenue, Araneta Avenue, Araneta Avenue, Katipunan Avenue, Katipunan Avenue, Katipunan Avenue and A. Bonifacio Avenue.
Tolentino also said that back to resign, elections, he will file the same petition and this is immediately approved by the Comelec and he is hoping that the petition will be allowed to solve Metro Manila and be with the public.
I hope that Chairman Tolentino is the father of Chairman Tolentino, Sucat Rd. and President's Avenue in Parañaque.
One of the things that I have thought of is the sale of the United BF Homes Association of the non-known as a video. "
Of course, their sales are expensive but hopefully there is a limited issue because it will be slow in the morning or evening the flow of traffic here is slow.
I understand the business side of a village or subdivision but it is right that the first worry of the officials of the UFFF) is the welfare of the officials of the UFFF) that is why I am going out of the gate of BF Homes towards President's Avenue, if the line will come out in Calaguas.
In my opinion, the non-bust operation coming from Las Piñas, Muntinlupa, and Cavite became a big number here, which is a big part of BF Homes in a private shoulder.
Happy Easter to the former parish priest of Jesus The Divine that is father, Father Aris, and to Brenda Tuason, who is going to be transferred to Vancee, Canada.
