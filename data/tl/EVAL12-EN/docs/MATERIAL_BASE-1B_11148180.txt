It is sad when there is no internet.

It cannot be denied that in every day, people will be happy when there is a internet because this is what they can see what is happening in the world, there are stories that are surprising and it is gladdening to see the things that are happening in the world because it is scary that you will not notice your surroundings because the people will only be noticed.

If there is no internet, it seems that if you are just in the house or if you are in the house or a business, you will not be caught, especially those from showbiz, artists, columnist and others.

Even me, cannot be restless when there is no internet, it's only here that you are able to save new information and news that you can save even if you are just looking for news from other countries, you can read it.

I also do not have the internet for a few days because even just call me, I will say to you, "once, we are to ask you," one hour or two hours, and after a while, it's really no longer.

But now, this is happy because since yesterday, I have read that my message on Facebook and Yahoo's message was always good so she could have been able to go back together.
