Use vendors, MNC, well.

Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada has been saying many times that he is a pro-masses and it is difficult to break off because even those on the streets are really serious, especially those who are on the streets, especially those in the streets, that is why it is being done that it can stop the flow of traffic.
That is why Mayor Erap warned the police that they are prohibited to extort the vendors in the sidewalk that they need to extort the sidewalk but they will pay a little amount that will enter the public funds which are left weeping.
But there are a few who say that they are close to the former President, those who make money are selling, not only in Divisoria, Quiapo, Carriedo, and Recto, but also in an underpass in Quiapo, it is a huge amount that they will ask for their positions, and P800 hundred pesos to be double in the jurisdiction of Quiapo.
If this is what a few people say that they are close to Mayor Estrada, it is certain that the name of the former president will surely be ruined but improve the financial status of Manila and improve the situation of the citizens.
Should, Mayor Joseph Estrada has an eye inside and outside the Manila City Hall so that his name will not be tainted by his name.
Um!
After the commemoration of the All Soul's day, it seems that it is dirty and piled up from the Manila North Cemetery because it was first discovered that it was dirty and piled up, aside from the recent storm, it means that it is clean and good to look at the said cemetery.
He is not very annoyed because it is really clean because according to him, Mendez.
A tribute to former Chairman Mendez in his good governance in MNC.
Hopefully you will not go to a councilor of Manila who are using the cemetery to earn money. After the cemetery, a councilor is a councilor, Divisoria, a councilor, Divisoria, together with a child of former Mayor Fred Lim.
