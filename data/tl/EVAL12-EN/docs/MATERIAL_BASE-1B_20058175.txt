The Senior Propaganda of the Makati is junior.

Wanna Bet by Roy "Mamondiong," Seneres (Filipino Star Ngayon), PO 2 44; UPP-August 28, 2014 - 12: 00am.

In the Senate hearing just recently about P2.7 billion pesos in parking building, Mayor Jejomar Binay Junior appears that it is not only the parking building that is being implemented, but also the small numbers that will be provided by Mayor for senior citizens of Makati every month of their birthday.
It is said that the amount of cake is P1,000. It would be okay if the money comes from the pocket of Mayor and not in the treasury of the town of Makati.
It is obvious that the Binays are doing a hearing aid so that they should personally use it.
Of course, if they send a cake to thousands of senior citizens of Makati, there is a big chance that Binay is the ones who voted in front of the grandfather and grandmother every election.
It is not far that even the children and grandchildren and other relatives are going to vote for the Binay.
If it is true that the cake is severe, it is just right for anyone to be imprisoned but it should be stopped that the Binays should stop the payment for the cake.

It is not just illegal, it may be stricter, because there are only those who can be believed that the Binay does not have a decision on that moment.
Vice President Jejomar Binay Sr. that is considered as the Presidential Adviser on OFWs should have been given to PNoy to give importance to the OFWs in his SONA.
Even if he whispered something, PNoy did not even say in his SONA the OFWs from 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.
Only two can be the cause of this: Binay Senior is no longer given attention to PNoy, or if he has not listened to it.
Binay Junior admitted that his house is in an elevator and she said that his salary is not less than P2 million?
