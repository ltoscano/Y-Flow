CDO should call.

I received an email recently from a long-time friend who is currently living in Cagayan de Oro City.
My friend complained that we should just hide in alias "The Eluvathingal," he said, almost everyday accidents on the road because of the complicated system of traffic in the city.
"The Eluvathingal" said that only in the arrival of the year 2014, the casualties have no longer count or were severely wounded due to consecutive accidents in their area.
He particularly identified the complicated system of traffic in the overpass which is at Zone 4, Brgy. Bulua, which is the cause of many and severely accidents there.
There was a traffic light in the said area, but it seems that it was seen by contractor, because it was not working and he was not working.
The residents have been complaining for a long time due to the failure of the traffic, but it seems that the leaders are not noticed by the leaders.
That's why they were forced to write to us in order to call the incumbent Mayor Oscar Moreno to give attention to their affection.
They want Mayor Moreno to respond to the situation and if he needs to make the traffic sector in the city he should do it.
According to him, there are a few traffic enforcers who are saying that it is a big thing and the accident on the roads will lessen if the traffic flow in some areas of the city will be lessened.
So because of this, I am calling Mayor Moreno to pay attention to the request of his countrymen, and allocate funds to put a traffic light from the dangers they are experiencing there.
Your fellowmen are waiting, Mayor Moreno!
