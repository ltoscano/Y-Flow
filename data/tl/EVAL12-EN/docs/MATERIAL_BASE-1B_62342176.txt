What is the policy of PDU 30 to the Filipinos who will get caught with illegal drugs in abroad?
Bira Masukat, August 6, 2016.
We will know the position of President Rodrigo Duterte to the Filipinos who will get caught with illegal drugs in other countries with the case of a Filipina who was arrested yesterday in Hong Kong because of bringing 720 million ransom that was said to have a market in Hong Kong, which is said to have a market in Hong Kong, which is said to have a market from the Value-0 pesos.
Just like the former stories of those who are caught and made the case that was being caught and made the bag of an unidentified person just sent a huge amount, but when it comes to the destination, the contents of the bag is tainted with illegal drugs.
There are already a lot of stories that is why it is surprising that there are countrymen who are coordinating with this kind of cases of drug syndicates who were caught with illegal drugs in order to save our fellow citizens including the Middle East?
We know that the government's campaign against illegal drugs is strong, so in this case of Filipina who was caught with cocaine in HK to know the position of the Duterte government.
But despite the fight of the government against illegal drugs, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) did their duties through the Philippine Consulate who offered legal services to the Filipina.
The position of PDU 30 in this case will be strong since we know who are all sorts of cases will help the government.
It is really difficult to ask a country to save a involved in the case of illegal drugs if we ourselves are serious against illegal drugs.
So our plea is for us not to be attracted by the glitter of the money so we should not let us be used to the syndicates or even to those who know that the case against illegal drugs is serious.
