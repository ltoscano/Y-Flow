What will happen again on Thursday?

The big question is that Vice President Jojo Binay will appear at the Blue Ribbon sub-committee hearing on Thursday?
If the son, Senator Nancy Binay, and the former election adviser of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Romy Macalintal, is the one being asked, the advice of VP Binay should not be transferred.
For them, it is only the Ombudsman who can call Jojo Binay because it is an legal issue.
But in the Senate, this is not just the legal issue, this is also one kind of political.
Because this is one of the political issue that also involved are his children, congressman and senator, as well as his wife who is a former mayor, it is just right that he faced the Senate to defend himself.
But will VP Binay face on Thursday?
He can imitate former Senator Manny Villar when he was accused by his co-senators who earned money when he built the C5 Extension in Las Piñas and Parañaque where President Noynoy Aquino called is an unrighteous path because this is being implemented or destroys.
Villar offered his speech first and when he finished his departure speech, he suddenly took care of it.
Every time Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago is facing himself to defend himself or taking care of his kind, he will suddenly take care of him so he will not ask her.
Ex-Chief Justice Renato Corona also did this in the midst of his impeachment trial.
He suddenly jumped out but former Senate President Johnny Ponce Enrile grabbed the gate of the Senate.
It is dangerous if Binay takes care of it; maybe he will not be able to go out of the Senate; Jojo Binay is not a member of the Senate.
VP is from the executive department and member of the Midnight Cabinet if he will not be careful, he might be held in jail and imprisoned by the Senate Blue EP / Raul VALNAs.
