The tongue of "Digong is growing.

In opinion.

There are those who told me that Davao City Mayor Rodrigo "Digong" Duterte should be respected in the religion because his cursing to Pope Francis is equivalent to the refusal of burying the Pope.
It is good that he asked for forgiveness because he thought there are many votes especially from the Catholic and Protestants.
The cursing to anyone, especially to the representative of Christ or whoever is the holy person in any religion, is really wrong.
According to James 3: 8.
But this is not just about the cursing of the criminals and killing of criminals without regret, not even the smallest bit, Duterte is calling the people and youth to do these kinds of things.
I am expecting that I admire Duterte for being frank and diligent in implementing peace and order not to hurt anyone.
We need a strong and honest leader, but it is not those who are increasing in killing criminals that is scary, that his manhood is a symbol of real manhood, and the tongue of his tongue to the public.
"He is even just like the Presidential" if she admitted that it is a message to the sins and reports that you should not imitate me. "
"That is also what the tongue is, a small ingredients, and made a huge amount, and the tongue of the very small fire, and the tongue of giving importance to our bodies, and his tongue is surrounded by hell." (James Reid 3: 5-6).
Even if he will not reflect the holy water or put to his ex-card in order to remove the soul that is pushing him to curse, it would be said that his personal acceptance of the sin that has a regret and promise that will change himself will be needed.
In my opinion, he would also implicate the eyes of all of this.
