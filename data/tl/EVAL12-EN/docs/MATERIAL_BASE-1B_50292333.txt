The Aquino government should prove that he is decided in filing a case against corrupt personnel or officials of the government.
This is what the PNoy administration should prove because until now, Caloocan City Mayor Oscar Malapitan presented to the millions of the Priority Development Assistance Fund led by Caloocan City Mayor Oscar Malapitan to also use an NGO) called by one Cenon, a politician in the city.
It is clear in the report of COA that Malapitan presented, the former representative in the Congress of the first district of Caloocan, of P25.3 million in the CI where he should explain where it went to.
CI should also explain where the more than P3 million PDAF which was allocated by Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, DILG Secretary Mar Roxas, former Quezon City Representative Luis "Baby" Asistio and former Cong. Luis "Baby" Asistio and former Cong. Mitch Rajay of Caloocan.
It is clear in the data of COA that occurred in the use of Malapitan through their PDAF because of the research of COA that used the pork barrel of Malapitan presented, on the speed and operation of the CI.
It was also revealed in the research of COA that more than half of the said amount is equivalent to 50 million pesos, but still not becoming a big sister to be given to the said NGO which caused the people to ask.
It is obvious that an NGO like Janet Lim-Napoles can be seen with the lawmakers of their pork barrel so that it will be money.
The research of COA (Commission on Audit) went out of an NGO connected to PDAF by lawmakers because it reached more than P3 million pesos from PDAF.
This is what the COA and DOJ should focus on because it is possible that the properties saved by them are from PDAF just like Oscar, who was reported to have a mansion in Don Antonio Subdivision in Commonwealth Avenue, QC.
