Belmonte, in favor.

It seems that they will continue pushing a charter change in the Minority Floor of the Congress.
In the words of Speaker Feliciano Belmonte, he showed all the signs that he is favorable to amend the Saligang Batas of the country even if it is clear that his boss President Noynoy Aquino said that he does not want a charter change.
Belmonte clear in the statement of Belmonte that it is timely to open the Constitution of the Philippines because many of its contents are no longer compared to the needs of the weather in the present, especially since it is greater than the economic growth.
The lawmaker insisted that the country is from Quezon City which is needed for the country to progress and not leave the neighboring countries in Asia because the welfare of the state is at stake.
There is a doubt that some will be used to Belmonte because it is clear that if a charter change and the Saligang Batas of the country has been opened, it will be given to all the amendment to increase and change like politicians' provisions.
Included in the fear of the critics of a charter change is the move of the Constitution by the country from the Presidential form towards the latest form of the government, where the administrator of the state will be dismissed.
Meanwhile, Belmonte is in doubt because as a leader of the legislative chamber or the House of Congress, it is possible that the representative of Quezon City will possibly have a direct agenda of the country's representative because he is considered as the leader of the biggest organization of politicians in the country and that is the Lower House.
It is just right to doubting the agenda of Belmonte to charter change but the public should be open on this issue because it is true that the state of our Constitution has not been used for the guidance of the Filipinos.
