Light.

Light (Jony. 8: 12-20) you have experienced that one night, you did not lose the light, even after a minute, you stopped going back to your room, and then you just came back to your room, and you don't know that you are going to go back to your room and you don't know that you are going to lead to your room.

Do you experience that?

Each has its own way of going up, and in every Christmas season, he keeps on top.

This is decided on this and this is also what we are working in the church, isn't we not doing anything that we are asking for our jobs and are not being looked at by Christ, the students, and their students, are not enough to pass and go up the mass.

Free from there, a copy of there, a copy of this is a copy of it, sir... there is still no trace of Christ, that it is forgotten to be brought to school.

It is not enough to have the ability to be with Christ for the family, but after a few hours of fight, when a couple is going out, when his wife is not a sexy, when there is no time for each other that is why there is no time for each other.

I forget to give a place for a place in the house because you are tired, my heart is tired, and we should always be with Christ, we should always be together with Christ!
