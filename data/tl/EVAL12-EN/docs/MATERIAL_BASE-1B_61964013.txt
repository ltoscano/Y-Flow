My eldest child is about to know and I will not leave now that I will not leave, I will not be the one to have the money right now, to believe where you are in heaven those who do not have anything to do.
Ah, it's okay that Friday, we already have money.
I will just watch over me because I am going there.
I can see it.
Or what?
Yes plastic bags that's why we are pitiful; we are ready to go to school; whatever you are ready.
