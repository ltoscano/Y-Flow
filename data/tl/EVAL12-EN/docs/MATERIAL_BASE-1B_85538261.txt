Like a squid, boss... the noblest Filipino.

The neck of President Noynoy Aquino is very familiar, and even if we guard him every day of criticisms, he did not give importance to Budget Secretary Florencio "Butch" Abad.
This is a sign that it is a good boss, boss or chief, because he will never leave you in poverty or comfort especially now that the whole country is filled with issues.
At first, the current administration made sure of the first accused of corruption that Janet Napoles was his accomplice.
It was still being investigated if three to be put in gathering the senators using the alias "Pogi" sign and Sexy "among the ranks of the opposition.
But when there were some names in the tribe of PNoy, like Abad the President went the initiative to take it slow to the accusations because there is still no strong evidence.
He is right!
Someone stated in relation to the credibility of Napoles and last Benhur Luy, who has a list of names that they have accomplices in corruption in the country's funds.
It appears that if Napoles and Luy are accused of being an accomplice, those in the opposition are true and with the allies of PNoy who were accused like Abad, but of course, there is no truth that there is no truth.
So the decision of PNoy is clear! Abad will not fire it and Abad does not have any plan to resign from his throne that is covered by intrigues.
Abad is not only in plunder, there was an issue against the criticisms of the people because of the issue on DAP or Disbursement Acceleration Program.
The administration of PNoy also gathered criticisms because it is said that Abad's relatives who placed it on the said healthy positions in the government gathered criticisms.
But the response of bosses, the owner of Chief, what is wrong if there are many Abad in his administration?
And because of his great bosses, she has chosen to look stupid in the people just to defend his staff, Abad, Bravo!
