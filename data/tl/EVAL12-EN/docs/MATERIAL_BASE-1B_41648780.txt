February 17 but I do not know why there is no attention given by the government of Padre Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos and Jacinto Zamora, aside from the show that we have a huge increase in the flag in spite of the truth that we have a lot of gratitude for them.
My goodness!
It is saddening that the government does not have a clear action to meet the bravery of Ghanaels in the current generation except for the habit of using their names to name the small roads in the far places of the barangay that I can say.
Some of our countrymen are still worried that 142 years have passed since they were able to be able to be defeated by the Spaniards so that their names have already been forgotten, even in the flow of our history because of the flow of our history because of the flow of our history because of their heroism made.
I remember that while I am in Facadty of Arts, Letecy of Arts (UST) in the '80s, the group's life was established in 1981, on this year, the 20th death anniversary of Ghanaza, in fact that this year will be remembered by the 33-year anniversary of the strong winds of Hala FJ.
Ghanaza was beaten by the Spaniards in Bagumbayan (Luneta) now, who is known as Rizal Park) on the 19th of February, 1872, after a Moro Islamic Liberation Front in Fort San Felipe in Cavite.
