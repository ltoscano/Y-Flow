Christmas Day is not enough.

It is not enough that in the month of February the month of February every month, that is why it is not enough for the old people, if they get married, it should not be a blessing for the people who were born when this month is not enough.

That is February.

Love of God is putting up with the shortcomings of people in our history, the love of Jesus, and if it is not for your family, the love of Christ said that, and if it is not for your family, the love of Christ said that, and if it is not for your family, it might have been a long time for your family, and if not because of love.

There is no perfect person, no perfect husband, no perfect child, no perfect parent, but instead of looking for a perfect person, it is instead of you looking for a perfect person, the love that you are taking in.
