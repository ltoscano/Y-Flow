BuCor chief firmly denied that?

There is a strong whispers that Justice Secretary Leila de Lima was looking for a gunshot to talk with the high-ranking official of the religion of the country because of his alleged involvement in the organization.
There was a news about five to six names that have been submitted to the office of De Lima to replace the resigned chief of the Bureau of Corrections, Ret.
The case, De Lima's name is a little bit more than the ears of members and high officials of the powerful sector because of the intensity of a member who is truly good and ready to work.
The camp of De Lima is slowly making a way to court what they could make it through but it is still not sure if he will accept what she is offering.
Hopefully the problem of De Lima is really good in the said sect, but the secretary has a way on how to try to approach the person he wants to approach and have a secret cruel.
It would be good if he will put the director of the Bureau of Corrections, from the said organization because it will surely be better if de Lima will become orderly, in case the official is going to choose because he is known that he is going to work well.
Only, the person who made the BuCor has a principle and does not want to come closer to anyone just to get the position that they want to get to his position, it is difficult for him to get his position, which is difficult to happen because the routine goes to those who are seated in the Palace and Senate.
If the authorities are going to find out this person who should be the chief of national jail, it is certain that those in the Palace and Department of Justice will surely no longer stand up in handling the stubborn prisoners and employees of BuCor who are stubborn.
