Extortionists in AOIL.

We feel so much admiration for the members of the Philippine Marines who were assigned to pieces of pieces of pieces of the BRP) to guard our territory in AyPanatag Shoal, their bravery and dedication to fight for our rights in the islands being forcefully taken by China.
Aside from the danger brought by the attack of the soldiers of China, it is certain that the sadness they experienced in the middle of the ocean is very entertained.
But I also thought that if the military forces are going to attack and they are trying to take advantage of us the BRP whom, what should our government do?
We have asked this because it is not far for China to do this to show us that we are weak and cannot fight them.
What will our small force will fight if China attacked him?
We do not question the slow verification of the Filipino soldiers in AyPanatag Shoal but it is also good for our citizens to know what our government is ready to do if something bad happens to them.
It is also good to know the command of them if ever Chinese attack, will they surrender or fight?
Since then, what will happen to our soldiers who died in AyPanatag Shoal, I believe that we are the only ones that we can fight against the forces of China.
Even in America, it is unlikely to stroll in a direct fight with China because we know that if there is a separate fight between the government of Obama, we also know that if there will be a fight in AyPanatag Shoal, we have no sufficient ability to defend this territory.
Maybe it would be better if we are waiting for the outcome of the Supreme Court from the United Nations Convention on the Martial Law of the Philippines (UPP), we will just speed up our beliefs and intelligence in Ayalin Shoal.
It's because I am worried that this might be the reason for China to declare a war in our country to lead the decision and recommendation of the Ubers.
Let us wait for its future because we know we are on the right reason.
