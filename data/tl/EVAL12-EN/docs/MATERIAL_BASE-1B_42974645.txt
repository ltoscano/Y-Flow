Juan.

Juan City (LE. 189-14), Juan is a person proud and arrogant but he always pray for the Lord's name and he is reading the Bible because it is just one day he told Juan to go to a farm and live with a farmer.

"That is where he found out that the farmer's name was mentioned, the name of God was mentioned, and then she told me that he should forget my name, and then he / she did not remember that he was in front of the Lord, the Lord said that he should forget the law of God, that is why he / she did not know that he was in front of the Lord, the Lord said that he should not know what is in the story of Jesus."

The Pharisees and boastfulness, he is compared to the Americans, who is humble in front of God, we should not look straight at the church, we should not look straight at the church, we should not look closer to the church that we don't want to go to church.

But you look at the surroundings, the real holy Week, those who are living with the simplicity of people who are living in favor of the people who are helping those in need of weakness, those people who are honest in front of God, look at the mirror when there is time.
