To the nails of a giant.

It is sad to admit but our country is hung on the nails of the hunger that we are eating when we are full of pieces until he will be full.
China is very busy on the quick construction of artificial islands in the jurisdiction of the Philippines' territory.
It was revealed by Vice Admiral Alexander Lopez, Armed Forces Western Command Chief, that the areas where China built artificial islands have been submerged and cannot be served as a house of a person.
Most of these islands have six-storey buildings and pier.
If they will end the facilities for no obstacle from our government, I believe that it will be in favor of all that was given to them, which is almost impossible.
The government is going to ask for help from the International Criminal Court for the entirety of the West Philippine Sea based on the said "tanim-bust operation which is against the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Philippines (UPP).
But everything we are doing based on the rules of the law is nothing to China, who continue to be oppressed by our fishermen.
Lopez also said in the Senate hearing that China is claiming the cost of the air on the disputed territory.
It was said that this happened in six separate incidents when they said in the airplane of the Philippine Air Force that they were flying to "military security area" of China.
If we will continue our view and China will be allowed to strengthen the improvement of our ocean, in the end, our rights might lose and no one will remain in our territory.
