PhilHealth, every Filipino, member!

Pay attention to it and we feel that the presence of PhilHealth and being aggressive in their sworn mission, 100 percent, for advice of PAG-health care.
This is based on the priority program of President Noynoy Aquino that we joined by PhilHealth president Dr. Eduardo Banzon in philosophy, every Filipino, member of every member, their health, Segging. "
You know PNoy and Banzon is hoping on this dream because they are doing the things that should be done even if it is not popular in the start, and even in the budget given by the Department of Health, it can be seen by the Palace to use his collection to PhilHealth.
During the last SONA of the President, he said that 85 percent of PhilHealth failed because based on the celebration of PhilHealth, this is based on the thorough investigation of PhilHealth, the members of PhilHealth, and those who have already used their benefits to PhilHealth.
This is called by Banzon, Project Suerte, perhaps, what he thought was a house-in-house of Jesus Christ, maybe when he found out that it is expensive and is going to go to UP economics to ask for help on how to get the information that he needs at a bigger amount.
So if it is like me who believes that PNoy and Banzon is serious to give PhilHealth, each family - help them to know the actual coverage of PhilHealth.
They will need the help of the local officials of the provinces to create their famous survey which will be held in order to pay the doctor (PMA), PR (PR), African-PAPP), PR (PR), African-PAPP), PR (PR), African-PAPP), PR (PR), African-PAPP), PR (PR).
Twist the Leyte and Pangasinan this January to May.
Thus to the residents of Leyte and Pangasinan, let us help PhilHealth in the survey they will do.
Are we dependable for you?
