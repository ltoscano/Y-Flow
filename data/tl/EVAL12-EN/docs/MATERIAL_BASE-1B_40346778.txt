The strange personality of Christine Pony.

It is difficult for the late communists to write about the weather due to the intense offensive of the military against the alleged enemy of the military against the alleged enemy, even some of the members of the took place have been involved in the revolutionary activity.
For the many Joe ta, there is doubt in the report about the members of NPA Party of the Philippines (CPP) and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NPA) and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP).
If the authorities do not know someone who took a communication, I am sure that even in choosing words, they maintain the death of one of the members of the CPP-NPA-NDFP) to believe in an encounter with the members of the CPP-NPA-NDFP) to believe that the alleged criminals and terrorists will never be considered a hero.
With their number of these, what happened in Barangay Calamudi, Juban, Sorsogon last July 4 is, if they will use the English language, "Severe Actor with the Philippine National Police (PNP)," this is stated in the website of the Philippine National Police (PNP).
But what is what the other side is saying, in one statement of the NDFP-Bicol War in July 7, you were mentioned that one "defense against the 31st Infantry Battalion (Izzy Canillo), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Rey (Ted Failon), Ka Tenny (David),
The military should not be impulsive with this accusation and investigate what happened, is it true that there is no ability to fight the three of the NPA, who is true that there is no ability to fight for three of those who have died, and what is not true the accusation of the CPP-Bicol. "In fact, the accusation of those who died in Bicol." In fact, is true that there is no ability to fight for three of those who died?
Because the accusations are serious, it is not just an statement of acquaintance that there should be an investigation to happen especially that there are seven cases of human rights from January until June of this year, Lt. Col. Ramon Zarraga, chief of public Public Affairs Office of AFP, with seven cases of violation of human rights, along with the cases of human rights violations.
If related to the death of eight last July 4, it cannot be avoided that this is a case of violation of human rights that even if there is an ongoing investigation, the CPP-NPA-NDFP) will have a reason to say, "massacred the eight martyr."
I admit that when I learned about what happened in Barangay Calamudi, Juban, Sorsogon, the first thing I noticed is the very kind name of my old record, I confirmed that he became a student in Jihadist, 199 (WBC) in my class and he is responsible for the responsibility as a student.
Even if I can only be seen in the university of the Philippines (UP) Diliman, in the '"90, I think that the students who are taking care of our political disposition are not used to have a high score, especially when the discussion on the class is just coming out to the problems faced by the society.
Just like what is expected in a course of your Joe Burgos, particularly the preparation of the Social Security System (199), the whole society is serving as a big laboratory for our research, but this is not important to this point that the only important thing in this point is that the only important thing we buy in the span of 90.
It is very hot issue that the Enhanced Defense Agreement (Tanim-T) is approved by the World Trade Center (Womb) where the Philippines has become a member of these sectors such as Christine Jolly, it is clear in order not to fight the rules of the Filipino rules but the general rules in society.
I remember the participation of Christine Jolly in classes every time we talk about the real situation in order to know the national situation, he is active to join the discussion and is part of his personal experiences in interacting with different sectors of the society, he is also persevering to join the scenes of the bird, which I gave to the students.
At the end of the Holy Week, I will admit that some of the students who gave a mystery when I do not know who wrote the topic in making a simple action (TT), I want to think of who wrote the type of students who have no interest to know what is happening in the society.
I did not feel the departure of Christine Jolly in UP Diliman, to go to other field of fact, it is not important at this point that if he graduated or not in his course, he chose to give a weapon for his life to make sure that his life can be considered as the most brave ability to do the youth.
To those who are thinking that the burial of the revolution is a waste of time and disposal of the future, we need to understand that there are many armed actions that happened in different parts of the Philippines since time passes by, the decision of the people like Christine Jolly should not understand.
Christine Saray P39, a student of UP Diliman, who became a student of UP Diliman, who became a student in the mountains, was not only a student in the mountains to be given a meaningful day but also the others who used the knowledge to open the propaganda in his SONA.
A question from a public service (Poverty) of the government related to the approaching state of the United Nations (SONA) of the President on July 22, "what is the name of the government on July 22," what is the name of the government that is ready to believe in the right way but to the promise of meaningful changes on the road going to the mountains.
