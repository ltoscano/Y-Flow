Temptation will be ion.

The controversial defeat of Manny Pacquiao against Tim Bradley was still hot on the stories.
Judges are asked to serve as Mafia, and different opinions but it is rare for Manny's prayer to hurt other people like a game in boxing, "the call from Manny, which is why he lost it, which is why he lost.
"I am just wondering about this opinion that it means that in spite of the fervent prayer and prayer of Manny Pacquiao, the Lord will still want to lose Pacman, and if they want to be defeated by Manny Pacquiao, it is easier to pull Pacman for no controversy.
Why do we blame Pacman's Bible because of his defeat?, why do we need to condition hectares of their prayers, "may it be favored?
In my opinion there is no connection between Pacman's defeat as a simple decision, there are more voters who voted in favor of Bradley, even if it is not a decision to respect it even if we do not agree.
Let us not drink Pacman's being prayerful.
"The prayer of Pacman is much better," the others say, that even when we pray that it is okay for us to pray that it is okay for us to pray that it is okay for us to pray that it is okay to pray without being shown and the Lord is the one he is together with.
Your servant believes that every success is given by God to us, we will not be able to reach success if the Lord wants to lose or to death, what is important is that, what is important is that, what is important is that we should not be afraid of Him.
Like Pacman, let's just be a loser if we don't get paralyzed because there is still a next fight, it is important that Pacman will continue to serve the Lord and very quiet to say that it is just a show and so that the pointing of finger will not agree.
Recently, Pacman needs to be defeated yet to lose the people who use Pacman.
They are trying to hang out and make a source of living there and maybe it should be stopped.
