Last year, Nathaniel Servando, PAGASA administrator was left to work in Qatar so that he can work for weather specialist and was given big salary, aside from big salary, there are still a lot of benefits given to Servando.
But before the departure of Servando, PAGASA, it was first left for the weather condition and is now in Australia when President Noynoy Aquino was forced to leave the country last August 2010 because of the huge damage brought to typhoon Basyang that hit the country on July 2010 which caused a huge damage.
But Exodus can no longer be stopped in PAGASA, last Sunday, three cut off and headed to Qatar to become weather specialist.
It is possible that the commerce runs out in PAGASA that if the government will not make a step down, they have not yet received the benefits of six months ago but until now, it has not given yet.
The commerce runs out that should have been used for enough salary and benefits that should be visited by typhoon and bad weather, the people who will be visited by typhoons every year and how no one will tell where the typhoon Yolanda, who is treated as the most powerful typhoon in the country, is pitiful.
I hope, pay attention to the situation of PAGASA and clinics because they will not leave the country anymore.
