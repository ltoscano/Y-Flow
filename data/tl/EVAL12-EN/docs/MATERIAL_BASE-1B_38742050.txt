Mar with Junjun Binay: You did not know the Makati.

Aksyon Ngayon "by Al G. Lorca at the Pilipino Star Ngayon), 144; UPP-July 2, 2015 - 12: 00am.

The Ombudsman ordered to remove General Alan Purisima and ten others involved in the Werness deal with the right timing.
Because, Makati Mayor Junjun Binay is accused that if the opposition is being accused of the administration, it is quick to act quickly so that those who are accused are being suspended or being imprisoned, all of those who are accused of President Noy and what many are saying is that he is not a fan. "
The suspension of the suspended mayor of DILG Secretary Mar Roxas will be the steps to oust him since he is allegedly a way of the Liberal Party to destroy the image especially by his father, Vice President Binay, who will run for the coming election.
That's why DILG Secretary Mar Roxas directly told Mayor Binay to step down from his duty and answer the accusations against him being faced by the Ombudsman, along with the brightness of the Makati. "
In the cness, it looks like Mayor Rody has listened to the advice of Mar to temporarily step down from his position while waiting for a TRO for Mayor but if I am waiting for a TRO for Mayor but if I am going to get the best lawyer to defend my case, in case he will face.
Because, I believe that if he can prove that there is no direct effect on the construction of Makati Science High School building like the accusations against him, or maybe he does not have a direct hand, if not, it's the people who would be his allies if the allegations on him are just about to use.

On the part of the administration, hopefully, Purisima is not just a nuisance to corrupt officials even if they are allies, even if they are allies of the corrupt officials who can give justice to have credibility in the eyes of the people.
