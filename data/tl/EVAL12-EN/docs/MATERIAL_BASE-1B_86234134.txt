All the All Soul's Day who is your favorite saint?

One of my favorite saints is Saint Tyo ese of Larang Tantos, I first read the commandments (Statistics Authority) when I found out that her mother died early.

He entered the convent to drop by his two siblings when he was at the age of Phpfive, she wanted to go to the convent, she wanted to enter the convent, and asked her to be allowed to enter the convent, and asked to be allowed to enter the convent, and asked to be allowed to enter the convent, and asked her to be transferred to the Lord, he passed away at the age of 24.

It turns out that the meaning of life can be found in the length of life, it is also not for the fame and wealth that this is in the simplicity and offer of what is being done to God.

Who are your favorite saint?

This all Souls' Day, we are commemorating the holy church.

They are not perfect, they also have the past that they are fighting for the will of God to get living together with our household help in traveling, they are continuously praying to us in front of God.

Let us imitate them.
