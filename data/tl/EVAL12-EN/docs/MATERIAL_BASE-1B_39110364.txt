He comprise it.

A friend pointed to me about the bad work of an abusive man to raise it in the Department of Justice (DOJ).
It was said that he was unable to comment that he was so strong with Secretary Leila de Lima and she has a direct effect on it, so anytime he wants to talk to her, she will face him and was ordered by the secretary.
And because of the onslaught of the storm Edusma's group to be used by Secretary de Lima, even if it is not related to the work of their department and the government, the transactions and communication sent to them are not related.
In other words, he used to play in a private transaction and also to scare the private person he is transacting with.
It was found out that in a few moments, the DOJ could use the "official captain," official of DOJ to writing a few of the private individuals whom he wanted to bullying.
Even if they have to collect personal debts or maybe it is for the homeowner's 103rd Brigade, the DOJ, which they are using, are being used.
It seems that aside from his work with DOJ, this person has also been in the act of the DOJ, and the one who made to collect is his connection with de Lima, the question of people who are bullied by de Lima if he knows or not de Lima what he is doing.
To their knowledge, if the secretary knows about the decision of the lady Supreme Court, he is certain that he will not allow it and probably he will fire it immediately.
That is why we call Sec. De Lima to look at her "when her yard is in-time, because maybe she needs to sweep the people there that is using his name in nonsense.
I know that de Lima is too busy with the number of cases he is holding, so he needs people who are sensible to help her work.
And I'm sure that it is not included in the people that he should keep on with the owner to destroy it.
