Sereelotes (JO-13-17) you still remember that as well as a notebook, a notebook, and one of the questions that can read this, Dr. Love, and one of the questions that can read this, Dr. Love, but what is your real love?

According to the good governance, "the son of the world is not able to leave the world, but in order to save the world by Christ, this is the reason why Christ said that the cross of Christ said that the cross of Jesus will not be taken away, but it was returned to the cross of Christ," it was returned to the cross.

The cross of the Church of the Holy Spirit of the Holy September 14, 335, and this is the start of the feast of the holy cross.

The cross is a symbol of love for people, but let us remember that the cross is no meaning if Christ said that it is not a feeling that it is not a feeling that it will not be a happiness.

This is not that selfish and your real love is your mind, making and desire a good thing for your loved one, the love is given by someone that has a love affair between someone else, that is why she has a love affair?
