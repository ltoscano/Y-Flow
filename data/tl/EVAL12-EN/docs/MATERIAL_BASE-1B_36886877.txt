Pacquiao, 2013 in the Senate? By Boyet Jihadist, July 29, 2016.
There was an increase in the eyebrows at the 6th floor of the boxing ring of Senator Manny Pacquiao.
The fourth floor of the Senate has been made into a point in senate president, Senate President Pro-Tempore, Majority Leader and Minority Leader.
Pacquiao only occupied Room 510 which should have been in the room of Senate Minority Leader Ralph Recto, but because Recto does not want to leave his room in the 5th floor, he just gave him in Room 510 against Senator Alan Peter Cayetano that once in the position of the majority and Minority Leader.
What happened, Senate Majority Leader Vicente "Tito" Sotto III will not be transferred to Room 603 because Pacquiao does not want to leave Room 510 where Cayetano would have not left.
In the two-day session in the Senate since the 17th Congress was opened, he said that Pacquiao was still saying that he was already saying that he / she was already saying that he / she was unable to erase the bad mark that he was holding. "
... there is no one prohibited to tell me that I am absent.

But my goal is to finish my job first, "said the senator.
