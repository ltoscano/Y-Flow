Duterte's revival of the PC was the long discussion By Bernard Taguba, Betchai Said, September 23, 2016, there is still a thorough study and discussion of the concerned leaders of President Rodrigo Duterte about the revival of the Philippine Constabulary (PC).
This was stated by the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Mike Sueno, along with the hope that the government will not fulfill the suggestions of the President.
The President earlier stated that he plans to raise the PC under the management of the AFP to exchange the PC led by President Duterte to revive PC which led the Martial Law during the time of former President Ferdinand Marcos.
According to Albay Representative Edcel Lagman, the statement of Duterte is more disturbing the PC will strengthen the campaign against illegal drugs and criminality in the country because this is where Marcos used the PC to abuse.
