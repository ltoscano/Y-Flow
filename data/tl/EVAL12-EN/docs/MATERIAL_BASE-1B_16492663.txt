Always be together.

Ginger Thy Walis name of Father Edwards B. Liwag.

All of the things are in the care of God, it came from the justice, he showed interest, strength of doubt, and most of all, those who have sex with evil, but most of all, are being helped by Espiritu of our hearts and minds.
The toll fee is stated by Jesus that the owner of the Lord is like a person who will be able to enter his farm, while the people are sleeping together with a lot of stones that can't be resolved by a lot of people and it is bad until the Lord loses.
Even if the Filipino worker complained to the owner of the land, they could not do anything but let the grasses stay in the ground and will be put into a good person to go through the fire in hell.
The owner of God is like a mixture of drop of one cup of cup, and it is becoming the biggest in all corners of God, we can progress our personality and will benefit from God for our goodness to help our fellowmen.
Our goodness is like the lesson that after joining our personality is using the benefits of our fellowmen, Jesus will give us a good deed to us in the right path, they are the one who will bring us into a peaceful house of our Day in heaven.
