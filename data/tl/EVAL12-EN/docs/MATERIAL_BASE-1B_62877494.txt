We can do: Because of PNoy, every Filipino is high-headed.
He was able to reveal June 28, 2016.
Just a few more days and President Noynoy Aquino will step down from position.

My friend asked me what is the best thing PNoy has done for our country.
My answer is many but I think what is most important is that he returned the trust and admiration of other countries in our country, if we can remember that before PNoy sat in our country, not once did he be involved in any corruption or nonsense in our government.
Now, when we are talking to those from other countries, they themselves say that our country is really true and there is also a great attention and there is a good education that every Filipino is given a good education because if every Filipino is given proper education, it will be easier for them to get away from poverty.
I also told my friend that PNoy is not perfect because there are still a lot of problems being faced by our country, for example, a big problem is being faced by our country in Metro Manila and the continued suffering of the traffic in Metro Manila and the continue to be given attention by President Rody Duterte.

As a from the province, Duterte is sure that Duterte knows the real needs of ordinary Filipinos especially those from Mindanao.
I have high confidence that will be given proper attention and attention to Mindanao because Duterte will be happy to give attention to the peace talks, not only in Mindanao but in the entire country, if there is peace, it is not impossible that there will be a proper progress towards their immediate progress.
