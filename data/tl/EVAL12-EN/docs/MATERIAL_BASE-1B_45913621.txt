Boy!

These past few days, he became a center of joke and teasing Secretary Mar Roxas after he was already called by Senator Bong Revilla at his final speech in the Senate recently.
It's because Bong was holding a driver when he was fetched by him to bring him to the Palace and face President Noynoy, a few days before the senator-judges in the impeachment trial of former Chief Justice Renato Corona.
In the said meeting, he revealed that he was asked by Noynoy and Mar to vote for the burial of Corona, and the next events according to English, the rest of history.
But what happened to Bong, Mar and Noynoy is the topic of my column.
Because of the incident, the baptism of Boy depends on the attitude, work and appearance of a person, that's why the name Boy Abunda is going to go out to those who are fond of obsequious with their boss.
Boy hope also surfaced of teasing politicians up to now that Noynoy is hoping to be given a position to the government and there are still many other people like Boy Abunda, teasing of my friend NJ.
Teng already knows why she was called Boy Akyat Bahay.
However, he is really good with Boy criticisms and it seems that he does not see any good deeds by the people who are not his ally, and probably because he does not have an ally, he is not his friend because he is doing something for his program every day.
He has no consideration and criticized even if the leaders of the agencies that he uses are not able to worry about it because of the severity of the attacks of Boy criticisms, you will really think that there is no other good here in the Philippines but only him.
You thought it was the saint of Boy criticisms because it is often mentioned by those related to God and the holiness, but in truth, she is not obvious what his intention is, but it seems that he only has a boss in their network that does not want to be obvious.
Let us mix in the mask of Boy criticisms on the next time.
