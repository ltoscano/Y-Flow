It is very good for Mar Roxas.

Last 2010 elections, the Ro-Noy (Mar Roxas as candidate for President and Noynoy Aquino as vice-President) is the tandem of Liberal Party.
Because they will be living together if Roxas is really studying to win, he gave way to PNoy.
Because PNoy is sure to win, Roxas hopes to win.
But the fate of Madam Auring was reversed when Chiz Escudero quickly changed and he was declared by PNoy-BI (Jojo Binay).
Roxas has the ambition of Roxas to live in the Legislative Palace to live in the Middle Palace, and Binay is the most powerful.
No.
Now, Mar is in danger again.
First, the Roxas-Grace Poe tandem is being sent to debt.
But the cat is still cold on the nose of the cat.
There are Alan Peter Cayetano and Franklin Drilon who are used to be used as a tandem of March.
Why is Poe said that they don't have adequate attention for a higher politics and public service?
It means that Mar is not expecting a lot in a pile of support to his good colleagues.
Now, Binay is giving a debt that Binay will become the chicken of LP and PNoy.
It is said that Binay came from the Palace as a message that Binay becomes a message to subpoena the LP.
One more thing, PNoy mentioned to his State of the Nation Address' like "blood pressure, which he had with Binay even though he did not have a relative.
But you are worried that he did not identify Mister Korina.
Meaning, Roxas is out again.
And Binay might get away from Erap.
Where will Roxas be defeated?
He / she is too late, buoy, Roxas will take care of his life!
Or Tacloban City Mayor Alfred Romualdez, according to now?
If he was cheating, that was when he was surprised.
But Roxas has hope that Drilon might get Binay because it might be about to be hit by its ambition.
Or Mister Venancio, a porter at Mr. market, Mackay, while there is still a time, all-time passes through RNC / Jun Briones.
