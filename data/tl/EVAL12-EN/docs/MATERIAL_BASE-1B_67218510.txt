Let's be more aggressive with the Senate?

Senate President Franklin Drilon is set to face the fellow senators today in the implementation of the investigation of the Blue Ribbon Committee on the "construction of the P700-million Iloilo Convention Center (ICC), which is currently being charged by the plunder case in the Ombudsman, which continues to conduct the law in building of the building in Iloilo.
Drilon would also inhibit on the interrogation of the Senate that it means that he does not respond to those who are asking the witnesses, but he is ready to answer to those who are asked by his fellow senators, but he denied the allegation that he had a part of their pork barrel, but he denied the allegation that he had a part of their pork barrel.
The question in the mind of many following the minds of many following the Senate Blue Ribbon sub-committee in the past few weeks, if they have done the Senate President Jejomar Binay.
Binay refused to attend the hearing that his desire is to criticize him and his chances of becoming a president in 2016.
However, what stayed in the hearing is the clear movement of Cayetano in pushing their attack to the Vice President, not only to destroy his chance to become president, but remove him from the current position.
Most of their witnesses have motives for him to fire back because of the defeat against a Binay in the past elections, despite this they were allowed to testify and crush the names and integrity of the Vice President to attend the hearing.
It will be said that Drilon will face a plunder case like Binay, who was charged with the plunder case that was filed by the Makati City Hall building 2.
If the respected senators want to be a trend of power over the investigation by officials of the government and politician "in exchange of aid and not for personal benefit, even if this is your Senate President.
