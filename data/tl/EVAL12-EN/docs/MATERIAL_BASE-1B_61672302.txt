Senator JV Ejercito, Senator Jinggoy!

Ten senators, according to the report - the Blue Ribbon Committee report about the investigation conducted in the multimillion peso pork barrel scam.
In the said report, the plunder case filed against Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, Jinggoy Estrada and Bong Revilla, and call attention that many following them did not expect the signature of Senator JV Ejercito in the said report.
If those who are included in the legislative chamber are pointing at the turtle in order to decide, it is the opposite to the action shown by Senator JV.
He did not respond anymore because he immediately signed the Committee report that will surely be defeated by his brother, Senator Jinggoy.
"Among the siblings, where is where it is," blood pressure, ", but became a We-nosed because it was destroyed by Senator JV.
In our opinion, the senator prevailed in searching for the truth behind the issue with the multimillion peso pork scam involved with three ally senators.
Even though it is not being shown, from the depths of his heart, it is painful in a decision to bring a sibling, but on the other hand, the signature of Senator JV is considered-worthy because the truth is at stake.
If there is someone who is happy I am sure he is angry, but if we are looking for the truth, the decision of Senator JV is right.
What is similar to him is what we have been looking for for a long time.
Hopefully, Sen. JV is the one to serve as an inspiration for allies in Red Cross in the Senate so that the issue will push forward about the multimillion peso pork barrel.
It's because there is a need to decide on other senators who are lucky to sign at the committee report if they want the truth to come out.
This issue has been impatient for a long time because the country is impatient.
"The billion worth of money stolen from the country is no joke.
Mister Juan should be responsible for the money of Mister Juan.
"We should not wait for it, hopefully it's as soon as possible.
