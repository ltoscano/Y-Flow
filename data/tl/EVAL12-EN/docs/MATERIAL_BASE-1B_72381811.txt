Let us call me "Bro.

Can you remember whose campaign councilor in the past elections are saying "Bro, you will help you, Bro."
Hehehe, getting hit by a crush, the saliva of Senator Franklin Drilon while he mentioned the promises to us!
It is like if we will be elected by the Senate, he will be the one who survived the poor!
Only more than two years have passed, what happened is different than what happened!

Just because Doctor Love is already senator, because our votes were already obtained, that is why we don't take care of us!
Because of Senator Grace Poe now, its construction is the top of the advancement of the "human tax" bill where a lot is having a hard time will plant rice and workers at the factory of cigarettes, will surely be pitiful if it comes to it!
Thank you, all of your lives!
It's good for us!
