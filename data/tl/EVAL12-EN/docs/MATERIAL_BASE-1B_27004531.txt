Binay, Trillanes.

The question is, Vice President Jojo Binay showed up in the hearing of the blue ribbon committee of the Senate in the coming Thursday where he is accused of various corruption?
Probably not.
Binay showed his own challenge in the debate against Senator Antonio Trillanes next week?
Probably not.
The presumption of this is based on the statements of his own spokesperson, who believe that the proper step or place of this kind of trial is in the Office of the Ombudsman and not in the Senate.
It is said that the Vice-President should not have fought with a debate because Trillanes will only use all lies in this debate.
The problem is Binay himself who gave a promise that he will just attend the Senate hearing if the order will come from the Mother Blue Ribbon Committee and not to a sub-committee led by Senator Koko Pimentel.
It has been Brigada Eskwela that Binay has no assurance that he will face the Senate.
She said she is also thinking about it first and there is another request for Binay's camp.
It was realized that they erased the proposed hearing and the stop of the Senate in the case of corruption and corruption that our Vice President is facing because Vice Mercado is a liar.
There is one more thing that he assured that he will arrive in his debate with Trillanes in a fair debate, sponsored the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP).
The challenge is Binay and the one who accepted the challenge is Trillanes.
In the campaign of Trillanes, this is his show to himself: Trillanes who is brave, not running.
Binay is also brave, but will he run, Senior EP / Raul VALNAs.
