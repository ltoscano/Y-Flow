Luckily, he did not respond.

There was a report that President Aquino was just detained in his room at the whole day, and had been charged after his SONA.
And again, it was not reported that he hid from the ILIM for the bed.

Malacanang also admitted that PNoy became a "boards or" PNoy in his room in my bedroom.
Everyday, we will always be able to read the newspaper which hanged himself while he / she couldn't emote.
It's a good thing, he did not commit suicide.
He / she was wearing.
Communications Secretary Sonny Coloma said that President Aquino would not resign after saying goodbye to the SONA.
Hhh, isn't it, "will it be?
Waste?
Our life is a waste.

Senate Prezantation of Franklin Drilon with PNoy in the SONA is very high.
That's a virgin! "

Why won't Drilon step on PNoy?
Because he has the biggest DAP fund that they got.
Damn!

The many allies of PNoy are convinced who are in Batasan.
That's why it's as if we have seen a lot of holes in the legislative chamber.

The critics said, PNoy's speech is lacking.
And because of this, his speech is lacking.
He / she was wearing.
No matter how PNoy's explanation on his SONA, he does not believe anything.
How can the people believe that the victims of the tragedy will continue to take care of the tragedy while the victims of Yolanda and the Zamboanga siege continue because they are having difficulty in hunger, suffering and illness?
King mother!

Outside the legislative chamber, while PNoy is under the SONA, the real face of the government of the government is there.
Filipino workers, employees of the government, who are being neglected, those who complain about the high tuition, mothers, whose budget is lacking because the salary of the wives is low.
... there is a driver who is preparing for the work of the oil companies, teachers, whose salary and victims of human rights are also small.
What PNoy is saying is the progress of the country?
