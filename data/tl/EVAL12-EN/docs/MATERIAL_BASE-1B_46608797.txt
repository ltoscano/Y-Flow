Sevidal.

There is 6, 2012.

At first, the saliva of the people of Akbayan is removed from the endorsement of Sison and the CPP-NDF Party of the Philippines) as well as a puppy of the US "now that Sison is still angry for Akbayan?
I am reading the statement of Akbayan as we interview Sison, there is nothing wrong about what is being said in our sovereignty, but this should not be done by a real patriot, but this should not be made into his own two feet in order to defend its freedom.
Whatever means Sison say, the Akbayan will look for a hole in order to live with him and his other allies, this is considered as the president of the CPP-CPP-CPP-NDF), who has been the president of the CPP-CPP-NDF), Joel Rocamora, Ekyong Fernandez, and others.
Perhaps, Akbayan is not happy when the majority of Filipinos are looking like this in the issue of our dealings with the US and China, the US can no longer use China as a reason to continue the violation of our sovereignty and constitution if they are considered as enemies of the Filipinos.
Maybe Akbayan also is afraid that when the Lefts about the meddling of China, they will not be listened to, they will no longer use the said issue so that they will not be used in front of us and will make sure that they are hungry for the millions of Filipinos.
If being a "Tulay na Daan" that is really patriotic, it is sure that Sison is not in the party of the people in controlling the price of oil, the program of real reforms, fighting for budget for education and other social activities, etcetera.
If Akbayan is the model of being patriotic, "do not just do it, to those who like this," we do not need the subjugators.
