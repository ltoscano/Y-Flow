The Tatak Noypi report by PNoy.

Today President Aquino will again talk to his State of the Nation Address (SONA) and we are expecting that he will defend what his administration has done when former President Arroyo will be blamed for the problem that our country is trapped in.
I am still convinced until now that it is good for President Aquino to be good, but it's just that, he is a bit stupid that is why his administration has a lot of failure.
In peace and order, for example, the score of the President is cemented and there is no one to blame here but to his former bodyguard, PNP Chief Director General Alan Purisima.
What should we be expecting from this person, however, aside from being touched by his face, he is also not respected by his own personnel.
We do not know when PNoy will wake up to this truth and Purisima is the reason why many of our countrymen are disappointed with him, and if it is true that it is true that he has been suspicious of the smoke of the needle and the favorite security guard of PNoy.
In the cness, I really see a lot of changes under PNoy, it is slowly getting a result if there is a result in the investigation conducted at the Manila North Road that we usually pass when traveling in Ilocos.
The skyway extension is starting to start, and if this is finished, the trip to North Luzon Expressway and South Luzon Expressway is sure to have the fulfillment of the LRT line in Cavite as well as the movements of DPWH Secretary Babes Singson.
This is also what is happening in our Hachen, because of the slowly coming, our AFP modernization program is coming true.
In short, although we can see that it is true and true is PNoy's desire to improve the situation of our country, this is a bad thing in choosing the person whom he can trust.
But if I will be asked, Purisima should not last long in his position because he is the treacherous of PNoy's life that will bring him to danger.
