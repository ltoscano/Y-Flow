Such as waste.

Are you okay?

I do not know that the operation of Philippine National Railways (PNR) has a celebration until the next month, that the Senate needs to amend the Senate before their operation will continue to amend the charter change if a charter change will be completed.
There are still many who patronize the PNR, according to data, 75,000 passengers, because there is no traffic because there is no traffic in other public transportation.
But these past few months, accidents on the rails of the PNR are ran over and hit, but remember that there is a set path, and it cannot just be stopped, that's why it's also the responsibility of people who went away from danger.
If the charter change in the PNR of 50 years will be tested, it is planned to return the original route from La Union to Legaspi City and it will still increase in the rehabilitation of other countries like Japan, Germany and France.
There is also a need to remove those who are living beside the railway, aside from danger to them, they are also doing the garbage plastic bags in their roof, that is why it is still difficult to understand that even if there is a pile of garbage in the PNR, it is still difficult to understand that it is not enough for a charter change.
