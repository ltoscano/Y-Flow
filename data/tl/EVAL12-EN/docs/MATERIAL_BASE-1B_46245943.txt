Mayor, Ibrahim Gutierrez Mendizziness.

On the 19th of .00.00th time, we became the theme of the theme of Chona Ligas in the town of Padre Pio "in the town of Padre Garcia Mayor Abrile Gutierrez in Batangas.
But, it seems that Mayor Gutierrez does not care about this foolish reason that he should be able to respond as "Toto" of Padre Garcia.
I do not want to think that the famous mayor does not know that this heinous task will not know that they are going to undergo operation.
Except if he is weak at hearing, the eyes and sick, mayor, will possibly affect the response of his job.
If it is like that, we understand, but if one of the mayor does not have the mentioned illness, then he should explain to his countrymen.
It's because the complainant wants to finish the Chona Karin, Mayor Gutierrez is tolerating his urine and head operation of "Ruel."
The operation of "Daang Matuwid" is like this: Those who were an accomplice of the UV Expresses that divides us in Batangas for a huge amount of bribe.
The tanker caused his center of operation in Barangay Pansol, Padre Garcia and the contents of the tanker which is gasoline and oil is reduced.
Maybe Director General Alan Purisima should also take the approval of Director General Alan Purisima.
