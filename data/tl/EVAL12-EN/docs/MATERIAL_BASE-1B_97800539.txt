Problem with traffic.

Traffic is a nuisance to traffic.
Last day, I was caught in traffic in Manila.
This might be considered as a experience that cannot be forgotten.
Just imagine, from Intramuros up to Malabon, I have three hours on the road - you will really be irritated.
To be honest, I got annoyed at my car.
The roads from Manila to CAMANAVA have been like a parking area because of the trucks.
The flow of traffic is not moving due to an unexpected reason.
You don't have a sound of traffic enforcers.
It seems that they are taking out of them because they do not have anything to do with the situation.
That is why in my full movement and repeated cursing, Mayor Erap entered my brain because the place is Manila.
I cannot help but blame the former President because of the severe problem of traffic in the end.
Because since Erap became the mayor, the flow of traffic in Manila becomes worse.
"He was not allowed to travel the bus in the city, and the city council ordered the truck ban, but why the problem with traffic worsens.
I tried to think of Chairman Francis Tolentino of Metro Manila Development Authority.
MMDA because the MMDA is always under the brain of many when the traffic problem is being discussed, because they are the ones who violate the order in the roads in Metro Manila.
It is certain that I am not only one but many of the motorists were irritated and cut off the day when I was in traffic in three hours.
Like me, they have surely played with their minds and it became the content of the minds of President Mayor Erap and Chairman Tolentino.
Because of the severe traffic, the contents of my car is almost gone out.
The problem is because of the traffic I bought in traffic, "that was the payment for gasoline in one week that was already consumed.
In the next two days of jeep and bus, I will first.
"That is why my experience is that," in the traffic in Manila, I really will never forget Ma'am OBE.
