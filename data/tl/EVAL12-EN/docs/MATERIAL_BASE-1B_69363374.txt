Corruption now is widespread in the offices of the government, only money is in front of those who need to fix the issue, just to buy money and even in court, it is easy to buy money and it seems that nothing has happened, the case is closed, faster than four o'clock.
That's why it's not surprising now that there are a lot of cases in court that even if there is a serious evidence, even if he has seen a case against him, the first and not his duty to achieve the case that he has been paying in order to achieve the justice they want.
That is why the news is frustrating in a prosecutor in Quezon City who was arrested by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) last week in the act that it will cost P80,000 from a filed case that will be the payment for the dismissal of cases filed by a military officer in 2010.
The NBI arrested QC prosecutor Raul Destura, a doctor and member of Morong, one doctor and member of Morong and members of Morong and a retired military, which filed a retired military, which filed a retired military.
This event was erased where a law enforcers is involved in asking for money to dismiss the case that is happening now, which is why there should be a challenge for those who are in office?
