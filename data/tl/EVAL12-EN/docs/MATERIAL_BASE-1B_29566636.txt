Joma Sison, style of bandits will be BE, Tina Mendoza August 6, 2016.
After being said that they are friends, President Rodrigo Duterte attacked rebel Party of the Philippines (CPP-NPA) Chairman Jose Maria Sison who should not boast, especially that he cannot win even one barangay.
"You thought who won't be the winner of the barangay, that style is," President Duterte stated when he visited the 3rd Infantry Division of the Philippine Army in Camp General Nakar, Junior in Jamindan, Capiz.
President Duterte said that the CPP is not in power so he should not be proud of it, he said, he won and is only good for the ambush and only in the mountains.
"You thought, Are Family force will be able to ask for a single woman, Occupy a barangay in a single one," Duterte said that the rebels cannot use all the forces of the military.
It seems that the word war broke out between the two after President Duterte declared the unilateral ceasefire, in his first State of the Nation Address (SONA).
Sison also announced that they are not going on the recall of Duterte to the unilateral ceasefire, even though the NPA rebels allegedly plans to declare a ceasefire against the troops of the government.
The President took the unilateral ceasefire, after he was ambushed and killed by the rebel New People's Army (NPA) after he was ambushed and killed by the rebel New People's Army (NPA).
This angered Duterte that the NPA rebels even gave the deadline to declare their own ceasefire.
