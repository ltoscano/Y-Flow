Why do Filipinos accept the killing of drug pusher? By Bernard Taguba, July 18, 2016.

This is the wet of some lawmakers in the campaign of the police against illegal drugs because more Filipinos are quiet for almost every day of drug pushers and addicts.
"For me, because of the long lack of trust of the people for the slow-up and justice system, it is also believed that the citizens are going to be imprisoned because of the deaths of various crimes," Cibac partylist Rep. Rodel Batocabe said that there are more people who are involved in the society that are caused by criminality.
"The people accepted because there is no protesters," says Batocabe.
On the part of Isabela Representative Rohere Albano, the reason why the citizens accept what is happening is because the people involved in illegal drugs are the ones who are involved in illegal drugs.
"They are already the ones who can make them know that the decent people of them do not care about them, said Albano.

"So what should be avoided is the abuse of the police or murder of people who are not involved in drugs because it's time to start the abuse, and lose faith in the government," Batocabe warned.
"For me, this is wrong.
