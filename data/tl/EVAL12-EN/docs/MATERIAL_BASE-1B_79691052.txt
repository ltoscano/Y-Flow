Drug war became the liver, July 24, 2016.
The effect of the intensified campaign against illegal drugs of the Duterte government is already felt.
The surrender of almost the thousands of those involved in illegal drugs is a proof.
One of the good thing caused by the fight against illegal drugs through the launched of crime in some parts of the country, but the decrease of the number of crimes in some parts of the country, but the decrease of the number of crimes on the city of Manila, which according to the Manila Police District (MPD), was reduced by 40 percent the crime rate in their area.
Other cities and towns in Metro Manila have not yet released a number yet in the decrease of the crime rate, but the National Capital Regional Office (NCRPO) admitted that the data of the weekly crime rate from July 1-19 this year has been set aside compared to the record during the first anniversary of 2016.
The cases like theft, carnapping, motorcycle and physical injury were really huge and the reason seen by all these was the intensified operation of the Philippine National Police (PNP) for those who are using illegal drugs.
Because of this report, it is clear that the use of illegal drugs in the prevalence of crime in the country is clear.
And because the operation of the government of Duterte continues on those behind illegal drugs, they are slowly getting shorter because it is not far away from the level of crime in the country in the coming days.
