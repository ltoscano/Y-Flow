MMDA still cannot be involved in change?
By between Dacer August 10, 2016.
The people feel the change under the government of Duterte even more than a month from power by President Rodrigo Duterte, first of the change that is happening is the active campaign against illegal drugs that is really no one.
No matter who is being hit by President Duterte and the Philippine National Police (PNP) Chief Ronald "Bato" dela Rosa, a proof of this is the execution of the dragged politicians, judge, and officials and personnel of the police to deny the accusation against them.
Why do I say this?
The members of PNP-Highway Patrol Group (HPG) did not have any behavior in fixing the flow of traffic instead of waiting for the motorists to send a ticket if not to be Kotong.
This style of MMDA from MMDA is old and most of all are not appropriate to the proposed change in the government of Duterte that is why there should be changes.
Hopefully, they will not wait for President Duterte to be the one who is going to be the most horny happening to the MMDA.
But before the president, MMDA chairman Emerson Carlos should first call attention to their personnel because their style is really serious, especially when it can be seen by your two eyes, who are pointing a jeepney and bus drivers.
