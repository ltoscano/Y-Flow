Dear Commissioner Hernaez.

Dear Commissioner Salazza.
Congratulations to the recent celebration of the Philippines season of the Philippine basketball Association of attended by thousands of PBA fan.
The record of the new Philippine Arena in Bulacan is confirmed, a proof that the popularity of basketball will never disappear, as long as the filipino masses.
I am one of the million fans of this game, I am still young when I am watching basketball, and many of the players I admired are in basketball and the altar.
Many of the famous basketball player, we can still see now - some of coach and Rondy, have some public service, and others are businessmen.
But I found out that there are stories of some of our former basketball player, whom we sent and used to those who came from poverty and are experiencing heavy challenges in life.
I believe that the former basketball star has an important contribution in the history of basketball and there is an important place in our hearts, Filipinos, and we should just be given a little care and attention.
My recommendation for you as the most popular leader of the PBA can be done to give a part of acknowledging the former superstar in every game at the PBA.
For example, there will be a bothers for a former superstar every time there is a game.
The bookkeeper just took pictures and video of the former superstar, to see the fan.
She can also be invited to be invited to send a cherness and taking her pictures, along with fan.
We can also sell the PBA here and their earnings can be made into a disadvantage or to our former superstar, to help them.
It is also possible that through acknowledging their contribution in the past years, it might be returned even if the former glitter of the former stars are small.
Thank you for your attention.
I usually get tired.
