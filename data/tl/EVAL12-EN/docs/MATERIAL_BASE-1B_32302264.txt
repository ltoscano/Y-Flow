Story. it is a good sign.

President Noynoy Aquino said, the EDSA People Power Revolution was not in EDSA alone but in Cebu City.
It seems that this is what is called New normal or New Generation, maybe next time someone told us that the Batman of Mactan is in Cebu and not in the shore of Lapu-Lapu City.
It seems that at least he / she can say that at least Sevidal, even with history, it seems like Smokey Mountain, but it seems like Sevidal is okay.
Why did Noynoy say that the EDSA Revolution was started in Cebu and not in EDSA?
"Because before the EDSA Revolution was started in EDSA that was where President Cory Aquino was in Cebu," Noynoy Aquino said.
Of course, "of course, it's her mother who's on the side but the mother and child.
Maybe our history is really needed to change, especially the people who wrote the people who wrote the people.
"
It is hard to focus on being ill-tempered so that you will not know if they are paid like Antonio Pavas to the writers of Ferdinand Magellan, to the Batiles of Mactan.
Cebu City - Cebu, and the cross of the pain planted by Magellan was there.
I have not seen any statue of Lapu-Lapu in Cebu but of Mactan, there is something.
Maybe next time the Batiles of Mactan, Batal of Cebu, and the EDSA Revolution was called by Osme√±a Avenue extension.
There are also those who want to change the EDSA (Eve io delos Santos Avenue) and bring it back to Highway 54, due to the number of highway robbery in the streets.
