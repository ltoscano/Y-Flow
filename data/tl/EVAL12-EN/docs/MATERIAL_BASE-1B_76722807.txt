"We can be proud of the Aquino government to be proud of the people and even in other countries but if the majority and the intelligent people are benefiting from the" Daang Matuwid "by President Benigno Aquino, only the poor and businessmen are benefiting from the top of its order.
"Why is it that because President Aquino himself does not recognize law," No. "
Well, it is scary not to follow the order of President Noynoy Aquino, it is scary that he will not follow what he is saying because it is certain that you are being picked up like the magistrates who "stated by PNoy while their power is almost equal.
But wait, the level of the economy of the Philippines has increased, it seems that it is not as if the poor are increasing in the streets and churches which are dependent on the streets and churches and asking for alms from the streets and asking for alms from the elderly, including their children.
This is just a sign that there are more and more beggars on the streets that cannot be said because these people want to ask for alms from their bones now because of lack of livelihood to give them the government.
Naturally, these people do not want to die from hunger, which is why, they are trying to make it, because if the government is not concerned about the financial status of the citizens, it will only move or command to the poor like those sleeping on the streets because they are sleeping.
Because PNoy cannot see the pitiful condition of the citizens because he is not looking at his surroundings, aside from the people who have no care for the poor in the streets, that is why when there is a calamity, many have died and affected by the government of Aquino.
When will the government move in relation to the continuous increase of poor people?
Okay, do not hide the real situation in the Philippines, but the day will come that the PNoy government is spreading so much.
