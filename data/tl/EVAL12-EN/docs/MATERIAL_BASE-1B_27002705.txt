One of them is Tony Milan, the mayor of Banga in the province of Aklan who is on the second term of service.
We were only a small businessman before he decided to enter politics last May 2007 and was lucky to win.
This is in spite of the violent, rich, powerful and famous politicians in the province.
Which became his opponents.
The enemies were able to lay down because of the support of our countrymen despite the candidacy of no party.
In the past case of certificate of candidacy, congressman, the desire to be led by Milan, is the enemy of a "Ipit Gang"
But, "it is not that they are being cowards because, according to him his fellow countrymen are behind him in Congress.
