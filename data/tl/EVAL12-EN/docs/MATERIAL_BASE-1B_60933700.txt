I have a patient that I see have darkened; what is the meaning of this, there are 3 reasons for the death of nails.
(1) the finger was hit or injured when there is a disaster that happened, or the finger was stuck or hit by someone you didn't noticing it because of this, the tree of fingers (snails) where they make a new nails can be destroyed.
(2).
(3) use strong chemical.
Eight advice cannot be destroyed as well.
Use a "moderate amount of soap, strong soap, like the Batasang Pambansa, just for their clothes and not in our hands and not in our hands.

Do not abuse yourself, do not make the nails short to get out of the can or things to get a taxi driver!
Be careful in fulfilling their nails not to cut short and your skin might not be cut off, and it might just become a little bit because it might break up to lessen the small corner of the corner.
Don't bite nails when you can destroy the full of nails.
Ignore the cuticles, if you want to remove the cuticles, soak your hands with lukewarm water for 5 minutes to destroy the cuticles.
Do not beat the skin on the side of the nails (LGJ) because your skin can be cut off by the snails that can be cut off, bacteria or filling, it can be difficult to heal the infection.
Protect your nails when it can be eaten when you will be able to consult for a long time or if you will use a chemical.
Lessen the game of conservation in 2 times every month, housemates can be felt at 2 times every month.
Take care of your nails when the nails die, sometimes it will not return to normal, if there is an additional question, consult with a dermatologist, good luck!
