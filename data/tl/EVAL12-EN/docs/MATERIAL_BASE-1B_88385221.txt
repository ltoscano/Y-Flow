Are you okay?

Some more active and retired general of AFP said that former General Palparan's "trial," said that he is innocent until it was proven that he was still active in the country's camp and it was not right that he heard the fraternity when they were killed in the fraternity.
I understand the danger of our soldiers in their fight against the rebels and to be able to say that those armed men are doing their job in the murder of the armed men, but to say that they are just doing their job in killing the members of their enemies in the politician and journalists?

There is a limit to the statement which is just being done at work, "hey, if it is still being done in the law, it seems that if there is a blessing from the law, it seems that if there is a blessing of high officials, it seems that if he is innocent.
