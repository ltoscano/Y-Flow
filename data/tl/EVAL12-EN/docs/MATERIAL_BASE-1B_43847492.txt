Bonifacio, First Class.

On Saturday, birthday of Andres Bonifacio, the first President of the town called the Spaniards to call the Philippines in the honor of King Felipe, a cruel Spanish colonizers.
When the Americans defeated Spain, America chosen as Manuel Quezon as Commonwealth President.
There was a election and Emilio Aguinaldo ran for President and ran for president but he was almost not favored by the votes he saw because he was the one who killed Bonifacio.
When he became President Diosdado Macapagal in 1961, he did First President Aguinaldo and changed the 119th Independence Day on July 12, this day of the First Division of Independence Day in Kawit, Cavite.
"Bonifacio Drive, Bonifacio's group.
Why was Macapagal's admiration to Aguinaldo?
The trigger of the trigger is General Lazaro Macapagal of Pampanga, which is an avid reader of Aguinaldo.
There is also a resolution now that people who will be happy to correct our history are hardworking.
Including the fact that the true National Hero of the Philippines is Bonifacio and not Jose Rizal.
A student of medicine at Universidad del Sto. Tomas, Rizal was suddenly pulled out and ran towards Spain to pass by the Philippines and to be elected by the congressman.
Anyway, we hope that our history will be implemented, which is even extended by a text message to the government.
You are really pitiful as the father of the revolution hit that was born on November 30, 1863, and killed last May 10, 1897 in Marayungan, Cavite.
