The National Football Federation of the Philippines would like to thank you for his invited decision to take part of the 2013 Anti-Illegal Drugs Act, especially the social gathering of the Filipino people for the real national freedom and democracy.

We also want to take advantage of this opportunity to send our condolences to family members, co-workers and friends of Realty Corporation, former Chief of Staff of Iric Arribas, former chief of Staff of Iric Arriba, who continues to fight the highest position for the national freedom and real democracy in Ireland.

The popular US in the Philippines is over.

It is only appropriate to hold a public activities with the meeting of 8-8 here in Ireland when it is given a good opportunity for the whole world to further strengthen the intrusion of poverty and poverty caused by the most powerful nation in the world.

It is only composed of 14 percent of the population in the world, but they are being used to the 60 percent of the domestic helper based in the whole world, those who are taking advantage of the entire world are taking advantage of the national freedom, or to support the Pambansang Kamao in Asia, Middle East, Africa and Latin America.

The Philippines has long been suffering from a social gathering of US since the start of the 120th century, the US was replaced by the colonies where the foreign colonizers.

Since the US was not able to stop from the Philippines, this has been placed in power in 1946, and afterwards, through the series of local government agencies in the Asia-Pacific, in the Pacific Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean and Middle East.

The Philippines has a new country in Southeast Asia where there is land which has a measurement of Italy and New Zealand, which is almost as a measurement of Italy and New Zealand, and there is a population in its natural resources, the big majority of the population are living in poverty.

Submerged in state, the country is a priority, of the local US and the local government that each have heard are the farmers and big players of the Black Nazarene, most of the farmers and Filipino workers who are roaming around 70 percent of the population and low price of their products, and low price of their products.

Not enough for 15 percent of the population are working in the sector of the industry as it's its natural resources, agriculture, equipment of petroleum products in the call centers of foreign companies, or more or less 2 percent of the current force in making the country.

The workers in the Philippines only earn a US $1.70) every hour for the workers in the Philippines, which is needed by a worker who is living in poverty, which is more than 60 percent of the population are living in poverty, which does not earn enough for their needs.

Foreign businessmen are continuing to carry out the natural resources of the country to make them recover from the operation that are being used in the operations being thrown at the other hand, this is the result of the destruction of the environment that can't be returned and when the advancement of the country can't be returned.

It is very hard for the local government to see the kind of Lord Almighty who are taking advantage of the economy of the country, who are taking advantage of the political leaders who are taking advantage of the political leaders who are taking advantage of the country with foreign contacts, sovereignty and sovereignty and sovereignty of the country with foreign contacts and racketeering in a civilized nation.

Revolution filed a revolution.

The big majority of the Filipino people are suffering from the crazy problem of the filipino people under this condition, the citizens do not have any other choice but to launch the annual voting for the national freedom and real democracy.

The Liberal Party of the Philippines is headed by the national under democratic revolution since it comes back in 1968, which is the primary weapon of the Liberal Party in the leadership of the Liberal Party and the national force of the Pambansang Kamao and the national power to steal the national power of politics.

It is the Bugnay, he is the primary ability of the Liberal Party to reflect on the masses for the revolution.

Local officials are composed of the power of politics from the level of politics and later on the level of reforms and it will eventually be implemented by the programs of the reforms and political, education, defense of self, local public service and activities of culture.

The uncontrollable fit in the town and cities which are launched by the citizens of the European countries, women, students, students, students, students, students and professionals, who are giving inspiration to the population in the country, who are giving inspiration to the population in the country, will cause an inspiration to support and be active to join.

At present, the revolutionary movement of the PKP has been active at 70 of the entire 81 areas where it was moving to the Philippines and voluntarily surrendered to the Philippines and voluntarily surrendered to the public funds and voluntarily surrendered to the public units in defending the masses in the countryside.

Up to millions of the masses to the revolution.

In the leadership of the PKP, it is still determined that the Botchok and other Spanish organization of Duterte will be determined and ready to push through the upcoming success of the Filipino people in implementing the success of the Filipino people and the strengthening of the war against anomalous state.

Even if we turn our backs to the citizens of Ireland through their continued fighting against the people and those who are opposing unity among the citizens and those who are opposing the struggle for the national freedom, improvement of society, real democracy and violent progress.

Success is a success in the Pambansang Kamao in the Philippines!
Success in Iric Arribas!
Long live the Republican Sinunuc!
Long live the national anti-pinworm medicine!
