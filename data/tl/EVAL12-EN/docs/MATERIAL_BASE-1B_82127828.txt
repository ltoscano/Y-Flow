Rapid bus by Abaya, MMDA Kotong is at dawn.

Recently, the Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC) was full of media coverage because of their plan to go out, using and traveling of the Rapid bus, in a simple term, "added bus in the length, which carries the gadgets inside it.
We are not the antagonist to DOTC Secretary Jun Abaya but the Rapid bus that they showed is being used in Europe and Latin America.
In the said countries, they put their own road beside the train tracks and they also made an underpass in road going to and out of the side of the road.
It means, if the DOTC will file a case in EDSA, Commonwealth and Quezon Avenue, their Rapid bus will build, especially the flow of traffic instead of helping!
That is what's difficult with the plans and system of the current regime of Noynoy Aquino.
So if Jun Abaya wants to use the Rapid bus, he will ask his personnel what is really and how they will build it in EDSA.
MMDA Francis Tolentino, do you know the job of your personnel at the time that they should service, during the time of Chairman Bayani Fernando, just in a motorcycle, the people know if the traffic enforcer is legal in their position.
It means, if there is a big white motorcycle, they have the right to catch them when they have a right to catch them, today, Labo-Labo and your personnel, at the chairman Trefaldighets.
What is worse, they can see all that they are buying.
In the corner of Mindanao going out of the corner of Mindanao, the three dancers will go back again, together with the vehicles that are prohibited to travel because of the number cowards.
Every early morning, U-u depends on the front of Traqui√±a, you are gathering or yourself, southbound, your traffic enforcers who throw all trucks to go through.
To be pissed, here in the middle or the side of the left, stop making danger to the motorists.
They want to bring license but the truth is, it seems that there is no shame!
