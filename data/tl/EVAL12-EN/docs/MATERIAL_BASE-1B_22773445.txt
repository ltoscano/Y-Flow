How much?

ER Ejercito was removed from the governor in the province of Laguna.
The case against ER is the very much money that he used in the election for his campaign.
It is a big scandal but if you think about it, it can be said that this kind of politicians will not be repeated again, all of how much is allowed by the law.
If we remember, something has been revealed in the media before about the evidences gathered and proves that all the senators who ran last 2001 have been spent on their campaign and violate the campaign fund which is assigned by the COMELEC.
But why didn't there be a case, no one can stop.
According to the law, only P5 for every voters should be the expenses of a politician in his campaign.
In TV and radio, that kind of amount is gone.
The only difference in the case of Governor ER Ejercito is the complainant against him, according to the news, and he allegedly got the evidence of the excessive spending of the Supreme Court last election.
But who is not too much spending during election?
Should the politicians need to be strict in taking their expenses that we know often is that the COMELEC should be more than the COMELEC and increase the campaign fund?
Maybe it is needed to scrutinize the Elections Code for it to be practical during these times, right?
If we want our politicians to be honest in the campaign of our politicians, put all the candidates all, there is no way to follow the order of the law.
It should be fair for example, now Governor ER was removed, isn't it right for all of the candidates to fight him and have a check if the expenses spent by each one in the campaign according to the law?
It is not right to see if there is an enemy.
