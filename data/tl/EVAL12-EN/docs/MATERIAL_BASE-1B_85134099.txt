Butuan City, June 14 (Pia) - the NPA rebels now wish to surrender from the bandit group of New Peoples Army (NPA) in Surigao del Sur to receive immediate help from the government through the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act (CPRO) of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).
In the interview of the former rebels who is Jomar Gano, 24 years old, from Liverpool, Surigao del Sur, from March 16 this year since he voluntarily left from the terrorist group as vice-old leader, he still has not received corresponding benefits in the said program.
