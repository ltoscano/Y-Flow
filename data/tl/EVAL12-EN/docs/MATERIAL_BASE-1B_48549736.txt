Manila, Philippines - Manila contestants will advise President Aquino advised President Aquino to take care of his shortcomings, instead of blaming the previous administration.
This is the reaction of Pabillo's reaction to the final State of the Nation Address of the President where he watched the alleged corruption of the previous administration.
According to Pabillo, the country will not move on if PNoy continues to blame the Arroyo administration that he should not push through.
Now that up to one year is left in the term of PNoy, it is not right to blame the government of Arroyo for the problem being faced by the country.
Aquino has been in his position for more than five years, but until now, he will still blame him.
Along with this, Pabillo was also disappointed because Aquino used his SONA in propaganda to reveal the true situation of the country.
