Mar 31 of PNoy's against the masses and who is Rowena Tuason?

I am already confused, his / her mind, why the PNoy administration has being beaten by the PNoy administration.
After all, he does not have a "amount of cable, entice" aside from the son of Ninoy and Cory.
But he still voted for the poor Filipinos to become president of the country.
Like that, the people makes our small experiences.
Because we are hoping that if not all, they will be able to fulfill their promises last election.
PNoy promised to help the FOI.
But instead of "writ of Information Office," his signed is "anti-cybercrime" who learned to make a "cylinder tube."
Or irritable in "of the press of the press!"
PNoy also promised before to solve the price of basic commodities in our country.
"He was not able to stop the higher price, the Administrative Order 31 (ao-31) allegedly signed the rules of the government to raise the documents such as birthcertificate, death penalty and other documents that the people usually need.
The promises did not fulfill, what he did was wrong, it was wrong that he did not feel pity for the poor, he was blamed even more!
Entice the President.
A candidate as mayor in Masbate City, what I know before is that he is also known by other Masangenos that Rowena is just an ordinary wife of incumbent Mayor Socrates Tuason.
Parkinson's, it has not yet been dreaming of the politics in politics that is why Mayor Ates has long been in politics in politics for a long time.
According to former Masbate City Mayor Johnny Sanchez, one of the reasons why he trusted Rowena, is because it was 3 1 / 2 when he finished the United P. Casal, wow!
And it was also previously served in the office of former Masbate Governor Emilio Espinosa and according to Sanchez, he is certain that Rowena dela Cruz does not know to work with the local government!
Entice the President.
RESalas.
