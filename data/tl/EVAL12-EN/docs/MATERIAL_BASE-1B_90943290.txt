In Toda, there is a need to look into the LTO.

Why is it that the Land Transportation Office (LTO) seems to have no care for the tricycle and drivers who are driving and not only in Metro Manila but also in other parts of the country?
Maybe, this is why the LTO does not pay attention to the tricycle because they will not earn money, not just like the big vehicles, especially those who are carrying or being a van.
In the consecutive accidents involving the tricycle and motorcycle, most of them have no license, and if there is a student who is a Permits, it is just a student of Persist back.
Yes, and there are local officials who violate the tricycle drivers but shouldn't LTO still need to check on its drivers if they have license?
Let us not go away, just here in Metro Manila where thousands of tricycle drivers are traveling, but this is not allowed by the said agency.
I know that the people of LTO know this but they are blind and just pretending to be blind.
And every time a tricycle is an accident, its passengers are becoming pitiful because aside from nonstop drivers, the motor is not registered which is why it is natural for its insurance.
Attach√© and Atty. Alfonso, Jr., LTO (Ientice, sir, it is possible that you need to check with your personnel the license of the tricycle drivers when there is time in Metro Manila.
In the observation of lily's observation, the tricycle drivers are not neglect the campaign of the local police in relation to the prohibition of tricycle drivers to drive without license because the reason of the drivers are only in LTO.
Lily's Calvento File are hoping that LTO will immediately act on it anymore, Alfonso, Junior, who in my acquaintance is an action.
