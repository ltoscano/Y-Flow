Victims of crime.

Millions of people were victims of typhoon Mario.
Even though many victims have subsided from severe flooding, many still remain flooded.
Many have lost electricity until present and many are losing businesses and livelihood.
Included in the livelihood and business that crops were destroyed, pet animals, fishpond, buy and sell illegal acts and destruction of destroyed projects and many others.
In Cordillera and Ilocos Region, up to now many are not able to travel for personal reasons, livelihood and business.
There are so many damaged roads and bridge.
More than 130,000 people can still be found in evacuation centers and depend on giving good feelings.
Our question to the authorities: Is it enough for each other as noodles and sardines which is given to all the victims, especially the million people who were taken to their livelihood and properties?
We are asking, make sure, because if the government is going to capture the funds in infrastructure that put the partner of the giant company, it is very easy and effective.
Billions of pesos and hundreds of pesos.
It means, this is different from the most lack of government for the sale of the government.
If it has reached more than a few million pesos, the government has grown up and are just going to exist.
No matter how many people complain about the negligence of the government for them.
Until the government will drive away those that are going to pass by relief goods because just because they won't pass by them, aside from what they are claiming of, all of them will get out.
Do you know, to express the care of the government to the victims of calamity?
They left their own air conditioner and they went to the barangay together with captain, barangay watchman and guards to find the victims.
They will not run out of people who need and victims of calamity.
If they can do this, we will get up in the Tuwid na Daan "if not, they will take care of their lives.
