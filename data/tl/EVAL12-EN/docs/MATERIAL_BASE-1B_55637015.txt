The big chunk of August 26 in Luneta Park in Manila and in different places inside and outside the country is a sign of the huge anger of the filipino people against the system of the public and the use of this the Aquino administration has shown this to the power of the Aquino administration.

The issue of pork barrel is further revealed by the greed of those who will hear the greed of the people and the public service, the citizens, and other employees, the filipino masses, and the local government, while the citizens are continuing to raise the huge movement and worsening economic growth, while the country is continuously declining and the proper system is ongoing.

The attempt of Aquino to lessen the crisis is getting worse, the people who are being raped by the citizens, for the safety of the people, farmers, and medical wages, should be encouraged by the Filipino people, government services, water, electricity, oil, oil, oil, oil and others.

They should focus on reconciling with the Marcos regime, criticized his corruption in using the state of power for the benefit of the relatives and friends that they have heard and will be charged in defending the rotten system of corruption.

There is a need to widen the act of the force of the forces against the corruption and pork barrel that they should keep on in front of the revolt against pork barrel and corruption that they should keep on top of the struggle and cooperation with the Aquino administration who are pretending to be against corruption, while the truth is, they also benefited from this system.

Expose the integrity of myself and the country's system of politics and social activities of the country to strengthen the urge to end the pork barrel of the Congress and Malaca√±ang to end the root of widespread corruption in the government budget for corruption and anti-Tropas.
