If it can be remembered, Aiza said that Aiza has already received a decision from the said Christmas show which is the reason according to Aiza has something to do with his acceptance of the project in GMA, the Princess In The Palace, that he said, is not directly hit or by ASAP.
Even if he thinks that he is already unlikely to return to ASAP, but he did not lose hope until now that he / she will go back to the said show that is why he / she was just a part-time ago, just like other singers, or on a long time?
In his IG post, he did not mention anything about him when he sits on top of his happiness to see his ASAP) and "the First Family, who is time to wear Barong Tagalog.
It will also be a happiness for him because they were appointed to him as Chairman (Undersecretary) of the National Youth Commission, and his wife Liza Diangco as Chairperson the Film Development Council of the Philippines.
Bongacosta, okay?
That's why it's a thing for him to have a shack that, because of the government position he is holding now.
