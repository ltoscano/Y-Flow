It is very short, we have known each other!

You are the child of the PU-seven in the whites!
When President Benigno Simeon Aquino III (Bira 3) in Tacloban City in Leyte, he got annoyed at the report of his chief of NDRRMC, General Eduardo del Rosario, the reason why he gave a high report to those who died because of the typhoon "Atong" Yolanda.
In the interview of Agmailig, France and Rebalde, on the first day of calamity by Yolanda wherein some possibly died, he answered the two reporters who may reach more or less than ten thousand (10,000).
He clarified that the data is coming from Leyte Governor Petilla, who is an ally of PNoy and LP), but the reaction was fired by the Malacanang, "he was removed from his post, but he was not removed, that's why he should just take a rest!"
PNoy came back to Tacloban.
But that is not our story, while the improvement of the surrounding is still in the height of the environment of the surroundings, especially the Crib News International Airport (CNN) when the residents of CNN that they immediately went to Boy market in his final age (equivalent).
Those connected to Mar and the local government of CNN were surprised, including some busybodies in that time, they were shocked when they saw that the trees were seen inside the edge of Secretary Roxas.
In the person who will be annoyed with us, Secretary Mar Roxas, along with Mar Roxas, is with Mar Roxas, and some followers of the entire night, they have not noticed the time that is why they did not notice the bottle and plate.
That's why PNoy is very angry, anyway, he blames the slow movement of their service to the victims.
