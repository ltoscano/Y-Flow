Bangayan and white!

Both sides in the issue of the truck ban on the ordinance by Mayor Erap Estrada in Manila are prohibited, where big trucks on the streets of the city have been prohibited from eight o'clock in the morning up to five o'clock in the afternoon.
It is hard for this ordinance, the truck is really prohibited in the hours of the said protest but, of course, there is a blessing of their employers who are owned by the owners and big businessmen.
But the roads are very sensitive because of the ordinance for the ordinance for the ordinance for the ordinance for a few days since the business industry is missing for a few days because of the issue and famous number of people involved in it because of the issue and popular debate on the issue.
This issue is important because no traffic is going to be good but is it true that there is no traffic which will affect the truck ban on the economy of the Philippines?
Many believe that there is a solution here, not only because the people liked the proper flow of traffic is to sabotage the roads so that the ordinary citizens who use the streets and even businessmen who use the roads are also severe.
It is really hard to change one thing that has been used as a sacrifice for everyone.
