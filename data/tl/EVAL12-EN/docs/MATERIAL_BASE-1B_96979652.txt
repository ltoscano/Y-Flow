Bullying!

It is said that there are only few teachers who are so happy, many are etiquette, education and not rude.
There are only a few teachers who are holding the role for those who are holding a role at 710-worker who hit each other, throw stones, throwing ice er and coler, extorting money from students.
They are few but they have heard the type in our school and that is our big problem.
The other day, we were amazed that this happened even in a school school, the teacher asked the student to scare the student.
"What the principal told me, that he should not repeat it again if it will be repeated again if it will be repeated again, I will be the one to fight against this teacher" what is just like that?
I remember the case of a priest, priest, my friends, who was pregnant by a student, what the bishop did was transferred to another parish priest and that's where the investigation finished.
There is a proposed law against those who are bullied, law, which is supposed to be a law against corrupt teachers, they are even a cheater that is being done by the corrupt students, they are still being defeated by the students that they are not type, thrown away from school.
These teachers are those convicted in the campus election, will add up to favor to favor their leader.
There are also many teachers that are scattered all over our schools, public or private, all teachers and professor who should be placed under the P22test.
And remove from Teaching Hospital where they were before, they are only few years old, but like what I said, they are the bosses, they are the king.
And the 55 percent that are sensible, you have a big sin that you are afraid of 45 percent and fear to complain.
There are a lot of vehicles that are damaged, but they are the ones to be standing up in the streets even if these teachers are obsequiousness and have no etiquette.
