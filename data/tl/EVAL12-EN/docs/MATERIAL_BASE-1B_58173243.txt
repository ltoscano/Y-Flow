Complaint of court.

Many employees of the court reacted in different parts of the country because of the strict implementation of BIR Commissioner Kim Henares in the payment of tax.
Based on the complaints of the people I talked to the court, they were disappointed with Kim Henares because even their small bonus was not saved from the long-term bonus.
Recently the SC Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno ordered to give all the employees of the court to the whole country to give up to all the employees of the court in the whole country.
That is why the court is so happy because they know that the said amount is a big help to use the needs of their families.
But their happiness was replaced with dismay when they found out that the said bonus did not release because of the order of Kim Henares in exchange her tax.
It appears that the management of those who can do better if Kim does not want to study the deductions of Kim, but in the end, the BIR will want it.
That's why instead of P13,000 pesos, the employees received a bonus to P11,000 pesos which is the reason why they have this form of Madam Kim.
They say what they know is that the bonus should not be put on tax and other benefits like this, if not up to P30,000 are received by an employee.
But there are also whispering among the different court here in Metro Manila which seemed to have been used for Kim Henares, because the government officials who are allegedly the responsible of the SC is the responsible for the taxes.
It is because the employees of the court has reached hundreds of thousands in the whole country, and if you will decrease the P2,000 up to each of them, it will also lead to a lot of millions worth of millions.
In other words, they have a suspicion that a bonus gave them a bonus and may not go to the treasury of the country but also from the pocket of the few there in the SC.
What really happened in the cup of bonus to the court?
