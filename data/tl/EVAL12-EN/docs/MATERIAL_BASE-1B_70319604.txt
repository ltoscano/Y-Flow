Former president and now Manila Mayor Erap Estrada are ready to be the candidate of the opposition in case the approval of the approval of VP Jojo Binay will continue.
This is the information gathered by Erap because the loyal personnel of Erap in different parts of the country already are busy with their personnel in different parts of the country, which is why the father of Jinggoy will possibly run again for the highest position in the country.
In simpler terms, the preparation of the pro-Erap administration is going to be the preparation of the pro-Erap administration because they believe that Binay will continue to continue in surveys.
Even the obstacle in the candidacy of Erap to the decision of the Supreme Court about his acceptance of the former president who is close to the 80-year-old in 2016 so that the mayor of Isko Moreno will run well.
They also consider the children of Erap to make Binay a tandem as vice-President because the two leaders have a good relationship.
In the past 3rd division of Pulse Asia, it reached 15 percent, it reached 15 percent, which is very serious to a person who wants the highest position in the country.
We also believe that Erap is also believed that Binay's current opponent will not leave this politics because this is really the greatest opponent of Mar Roxas.
Aside from Binay, Estrada's camp is focusing on Senator Grace Poe and Bongbong Marcos as the possible co-tandem of Erap in 2016.
Aside from losing the opposition in 2016, it is said that Erap believes that the only way for him to save his son Jinggoy is the only way for him to save his son Jinggoy with a plunder and imprisoned in Camp Crame.
