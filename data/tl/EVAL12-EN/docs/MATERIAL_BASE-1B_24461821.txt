Why not yet given the showbiz drug list?
October 13, 2016.
On the third narco-list that the President mentioned in his speech, there are 5,000 barangay captains (in other reports of 6,000 pesos and others were 8,000 policemen here and there are congressmen and governor.
But because of the many names, he will not mention to it even if he has given the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) to make action.
But those from showbiz who are involved in illegal drugs have been involved in illegal drugs, whether it has no more than 100 pesos, according to reports, it is just about 30.
It is not hard to expose these names.
It is true that it is not good that the victims of illegal drugs are not good, but if they are prohibited to be victimized by the victims because the first narco-list is sarcastic, but before the initial narco-list, they think that the first narco-list is very lonely.
It has been two lines of names - because the third is the third, she is no longer enumerated all the amount, that is why it's their usual difference if he is on top of the narco-list of showbiz.
Others are doubting the reason why the President could not be able to pay the drug personalities in showbiz who have reached her because there are some of them who have no solid supporters.
But, if this is the spreading story, even if it is not good for the actors supporters of the President, it is still not good for all artists, as well as the artists, even their supporters in the election.

It has been released back then by names, there is a drug ring on what the people from showbiz said to say that the time he is courting the president to expose their names in the public is not right.
If the reason is that she is bashed by a big sister, then the time spent for it is too long.
Release the showbiz narco-list!
