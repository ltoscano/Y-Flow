We need to be.
By Jimmy Cantos, July 5, 2016.
Gilas Pilipinas against France will again compete in the fight this night at the Asian Games Quitago Elementary School which will be done at the Mall of Asia Arena.
Like all Filipino basketball fans, I am hoping that we will be able to give a good fight with Tony Parker and her co-Pramis, but I know that all of our fellowmen are hoping to be defeated by Peras, France.
One coach of the team has said that it is impossible for us to defeat France but in case, New Zealand is right.

Lyle is needed to defeat any in France and New Zealand to enter into a disadvantage or finals where Turkey, Canada or Senegal is waiting.
Just one position in the Rio Olympics, which will be done in the next month in Brazil will be at the next month in Brazil, even if we lose one times in a low pressure, our hope to return to the Olympics is still alive.
The Philippines was last played in the Olympics in 1972.
These past few days are the players of Gilas a Filipino basketball fans who were mobbed by their game and hoping to wear a white in the fight in France and blue in the fight in New Zealand.
We know all of what is said to be, whether the homeowners are doing, and the Morticio of any team and need to be Gilas well of all the support that we have given.
They say, the ball is full and there are many times that we have seen what is the effect of the crowd in the game, so if you do not have anything to do this night, you have not yet done the GAA.
A word of gratitude, as it is said to be cooked in.
We hope that we are hoping that we will be guided by basketball, but we also need to be firm and will be objective.
We know that aside from Tony Parker, there is another NBA who is France.
Don't you believe what Parker said that they are very afraid in Gilas because of the shooting of the team just playing with Parker.
Against New Zealand, we can implement all the severe victory.
