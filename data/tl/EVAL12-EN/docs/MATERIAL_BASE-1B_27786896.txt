It is a big help for the poor.

Hi's briefs on Roy "Mamondiong," Seiko Films.

The bill will be approved by the Lower House the bill where it will have additional P2,000 pension every month that all the aging pensioners are in the Social Security System (SSS).
It is true that this is really timely and can be considered as "tanim-" from heaven, because you know that the most low pension that the people received are not additional P2,000?
And because grandpa and grandmother is sickly, it still does not have money to buy medicine anymore.
The P2,000 will lead to the board of their monthly pension increase, that means, all pensioners in the SSS do not want to give additional P2,000 every month to what they are receiving.
The President should immediately make the additional pension increase to help our motherland and most of them now that majority of them have been placed under life and are all in the departure area. "
It is good that it is just like our National Capital "plane when he was late," so our grandfather and grandmother are still alive.

That's why they need to give the help of our government so the government should not refuse the P2,000 pension increase in the pension from the SSS from our district, which led to the private sector their skills to their productive community.
Everyone should all law from us in the Lower House and even in the Senate, for the welfare of our poor countrymen.
Always, the government should show up and concern for his citizens.
