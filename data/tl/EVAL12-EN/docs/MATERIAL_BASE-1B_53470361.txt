Jason got insecure to Melai By Jun Lalin July 30, 2016.
It was sent to us by a member of Magandang Buhay of the episode is happening yesterday where Bea Alonzo and Gerald Anderson Silva will complain yesterday where Bea Alonzo and Gerald Anderson Silva again and this is currently being shown in cinemas.
The staff of show show to us the statement of one of their employers, Melai Cantiveros, related to a love and Destiny.
Because from the start of the show, there is a sign that you will leave your loved one so that you will be left in Destiny Rose, Melai said it was not the one who passed by Karla Estrada and told her to be a loved one in Destiny Rose.
"So," my Destiny is, "my husband (Jason Francisco), so no matter how much the problem comes, she is crying and crying at this point, but it is obvious that she is not allowed to combat that.
"Because of course, he / she was forever.
Even if Jason has already released a complaint about their breakup with Melai and Carlo Aquino, who seemed to have been implicated by the TV host / Insp. enne in We Benetat, Melai did not directly talk about it about his separation with her husband.
According to those who are close to Melai, he is still hoping that even if the problem between her husband is widespread, it will also be fixed and the family will be built again.
If it can be remembered, Melai and Jason got a problem on the day, but they were not able to get married before, but this was fixed and they reconciled again.
There was another chance to comment that Jason got insecure because it is a bit of career for him.
What can Jason say about this matter?
Wish, Wish, his / her reaction will not be complete, and maybe he / she just got insecure so he got insecure so!
