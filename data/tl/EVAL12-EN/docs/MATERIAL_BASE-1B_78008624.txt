Are you pitiful or PINEve?

The order of Don Benigno Aquino III is wrong with Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin to stop the rehabilitation and rehabilitation of our airports in Kalayaan Island in Palawan.
PNoy's reason, his regime might be destroyed in the International Criminal Court of Justice (ALJ) because of the cases filed against China in our territory at the West Philippine Sea because it might affect the state of complaints?
It is wrong for us to have the first airports in many islands of Spratings, we are the owner of any basis and data, on the international agreement in the United Nations in history.
If the airport will fix this, this should not be done but to our fellow countrymen who are in the island of Kalayaan, that should be in your minds, Mister Aquino.
You should give primary attention in fixing the airports in Kalayaan, not only that, you should get rid of a big and strong ports for our countrymen who want to live in Kalayaan, but because of the extreme lack of service from the government, they are able to return to their former home.
With the huge amount of money from PDAF and DAP, it would be a big help to the country that you can help from the country or to do the islands being implemented by the prisoners from the National Bilibid Prison or provincial.
What is really the reason, Mister President?
Or maybe your allies in the Liberal Party might regret it because of the huge amount of money needed in Kalayaan, so you opted not to continue the project because you need to continue the elections in 2016?
It is not bad to say to you, Mister Aquino, if it is not for your boastfulness, we should not go wild and our islands in there of Spratamak.
When their government reacted, that resulted to the disappearance of many of our territory! The fishermen, who were previously held at sea of sea, now, seems to be a beggar who is bronchitis, Ed ARL.
