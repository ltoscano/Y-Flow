By Jake Macasaet in August 18, 2016, in the past report of almost all media that the Duterte administration was charged by the Duterte administration, I did not know anything about this thing except in Binondo Central Bank, which led by the high authorities including former President Ferdinand Marcos, including former President Ferdinand Marcos.
Not benefited from the government of Marcos in Binondo Central Bank did not benefited from in Binondo Central Bank because it was neglected by a high-ranking official who pretended to have surrendered, they did not know what they were doing.

They filed a case against the-dollar global warming which filed a case on top.
As a matter of fact, Sally Sy was focusing on how much the dollar will buy and how much will buy the dollars, there will be a pipe by the armed men who came to Hong Kong, there was a score of a warrant of arrest that had no name.
In my opinion, he strongly trusts that, when Gov. Jose B. Fernandez of Central Bank and President Marcos said to me, Jobo Fernandez who was selling the role of Central Central in the annual interest to reach 30 percent.
When the government of Marcos fell down, the government of Cory Aquino ran after the said knives, and was not shaken with a case against him including the allegations that the payment for tax was lacking.
Along with the Philosophy in company, he sold all the more than fifty percent control.
