You are not with my father.

Reporting for TV Patrol.
The only good memory only to you is basketball, a few decades since then.
Oftentimes, when you are picking up in elementary, we will go straight to SM Megamall for my piano, but at the Araneta Coliseum, Cuneta Astrodome, in order to watch the game of Ginebra.
"It will also become a long time during Christmas, we are able to escape from going to Luneta Park because our favorite team was playing in Luneta Park now, that is the happiest time to watch a tree of" Get-ball! "Said" Defense! "" Said that there are still some who are pointing at the referees and players. "
When I am in the house I watch, I faster to eat dinner so that I can see the names of the five-five who are usually identified as Mark Caguioa, Jaye Helmets and Eric Menetiquette.
In one corner of the room, I was alone at one o Okawa, Angels of Slam, I was able to make my own hands and improvement of the foot, but I just moved up with my self-cheer of "Gi-NEB-NEB-NEB)"
I have also made a ritual for example, when the opponent is in a distance of free line, I am not looking at a basket so that I would always wait for the entry of my favorite players - Christmas Salvacion, Mark Macapagal and Aries Dimaunahan.
I am waiting for how fast that they remain in the court, which is almost up to ten minutes, compared to the very time of your favorite Catholic Church in The SPARK.
Probably, you are not aware of that.
I often compare the game on basketball in our relationship because from our favorite players, it's as if we are able to ask the difference between us in attitude and I am quiet, you are the opposite.
Or maybe, it seems that the entry of Rommel Adosto will go to our fight, always outside because the possible hope that we fix it is like it was back to the back of Ginebra in 2005 and it did not happen again.
Even if I really keep my memory for the other remaining memories of you, it is only on basketball when you are talking to him while I am still in a corner but I am still in a corner, but I am now even more than a father.
But will you just call me "happy Father's Day," I know you didn't read this because I am coward, like you.
