Duterte, there is also a need.

It is time for Davao City Mayor Rudy Duterte to grant the call of the people to serve the whole country.
This is the challenge of the current time because the mayor of Davao City is known for being a tough, especially in the issue of peace and order.
The conflict in the country is so right that is why the wish of Duterte does not death because he also ran in the upcoming elections.
A Rudy Duterte has not placed it in the Senate but he needs the country to a higher position that will focus on criminality in the country.
On the sun that the Lord has done, the conflict is not missing and it seems that it gets worse because those committing them are not afraid of anything.
Maybe his duty in his city is already over, that is why it is time to address the call of the whole state.
The progress of the country depends on a good peace and order and this is the right action of Duterte who is known by the criminals.
Davao City is changing because of his unusual style in fighting for the crime.
That's why this is what the entire Filipino people wait for, because the chaos in every corner of the country is really low.
Killings, robbery, hold-up and drugs are happening so the country is looking for a solution.
The call for Dumagat-Remontadoses have succeeded in the fight.
There is a different tactic that should be tried by the country in the crime and here in the fight, Duterte is going to fight back to the fight of Duterte.
