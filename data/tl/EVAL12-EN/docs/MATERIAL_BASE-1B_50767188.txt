Congratulations!

At last, the history of the Philippines is slowly going to change, hopefully there is also a change for the text message of the author as Jose Rizal the number 1 hero and Emilio Aguinaldo at the first President of the Philippines.
Before, the students' students are trying to study and do not pass, are not going to pass after graduating.
But who is really the right?
Every time they have their own heroes.
In the present, according to the leaders of West Min Com), what is right to be Number 1 Hero was as Corazon Cojuangco, there are also those who are saying that the honor should be given to his wife Benigno "Ninoy Aquino" Aquino.
And so that the poor did not expect that they are being neglected by the government which was headed by the municipal hall, they called the new heroes of OFWs or Overseas Filipino Workers.
It's okay, "that's okay, but hopefully, they should be given attention to the famous heroes and expose if they are truly patriotic.
Let us organize the history while there is still time.
Is Rizal patriotic, whose goal is to remain under the Spanish colonizers in our country?
Rizal was against the revolution when he killed the goal of Indiana to be free from his book that El Filibusterismo are free.
Before he was sentenced to death by the Spanish friars, you are assigned to Cuba to help the Spanish students, who are slowly lost in the war against the United States of America.
Aguinaldo sold the freedom in exchange for the money offered by the Spaniards.
When America attacked the Philippines, he became pro-America, and when the World War is in Japan, he became pro-Japan.
