The loyalty of a child.

Ginger Thy Walis name of Father Edwards B. Liwag.

Let us go out and celebrate that our king should have lost it and it comes to our weekly celebration, we thank the goodness of God, "God and my king."
In our all kinds of Him, we also thank his blessings because we are still alive according to the contents of the people that is being done by the people and not from the contents of the people that we have done by the contents of our flesh that are all the fault of the indecency.
In the Bible, Jesus showed his gratitude to the Lord of heaven and earth because he kept all the things for the child, no one knows how to plant anger towards others even if the child does not stop thinking if the child does not stop thinking if they do not stop their feelings.
We will wait for us to pray that the challenges are blessings from us by God, you did not neglect us, all of our lives, we need to study it!
Are you a problem, brother, you are lucky and you trust the Lord, "that is the good thing that is popular with your life!
