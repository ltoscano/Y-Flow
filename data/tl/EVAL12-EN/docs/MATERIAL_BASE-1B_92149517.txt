Fight!

It can be seen that a leader who is seated in the government needs to consider the motives, the leaders who are elected by the country, be observed and discreet in their corruption.

An intense mystery is being written on him by a lot of mansion that the value is up to hundreds of millions, many businesses and properties, while salary is small and have no ability in the right way.

However, why is it very rich and almost all of the families were assigned in office; always throw and have no response to the right reason, but to use all the funds of the country.

It can't be recalled that even if they were taking advantage of the country's money, when they are trusted and elected by the country, he became the ones who takes care of each other.

They do not seem to be greedy and greedy, only stealing in the minds, and they do not care about the real feelings of the people.

This is not right and there is no reason for reason; that there is always an expert and taking sides, all of them from Congress, Malacanang and even the Court are all greedy and being punished, that's why those who are guilty are continuing in corruption.

It is enough that... that something is too much,... there is too much!

Fight the conservation in our politics.

End the people who take advantage, so that our country will be freed and comfortable.
