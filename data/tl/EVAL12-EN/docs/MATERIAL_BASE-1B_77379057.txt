He was so out of selling RA 9165.

Senator Ralph Recto wants to spend on the remaining pork barrel for the victims of the previous earthquake, the others said, expenses are going to be a good fund for the said division.
And there are also lawmakers who say that the pork barrel should be used to give money to those who have illnesses, the customers, the catholic Church and streets and bridges destroyed by the earthquake.
They had a big money, but Recto said and his companions said they will not interfere with the expenses of the funds and it is up to President Noynoy to use this money.
Will it go to the poor people, for those who are affected, for those who are affected, the councilor, mayor and vice mayor, senators and vice mayor, congressmen, senators and senators, supporters and senators who are against them?
It is not impossible to happen that the Department of Public Works and Highways, the Department of Agriculture, Department of Agrarian Reform and even the entire Congress.
Even if one of the corrupt officials of the said department or agencies of the government are trapped or the suspension of one of the incessant rain, they are included with the non-government organization (NGO), including the non-government organization (NGO).
President Noynoy promised to separate the pork barrel of the lawmakers, but the pork barrel scam is not his own pork barrel.
But it seems that Noynoy was fooled by the Supreme Court on the pork barrel, the Solicitor of President Noynoy himself was the leader of President Noynoy himself to return the pork barrel.
I hope that I have been a government official just because I hope that I will be millions of people whom I've proposed to the government every month.
