We should only do a gun.
By Bernard Taguba, November 6, 2016, I have watched foreign countries and even in foreign television, that the guns used by syndicates are from the Philippines.
The guns are not good, beautiful kinds of guns.
This is just an indication that there are many Filipinos who made a gun, are Danao in Cebu are known to make guns, just hide because it is prohibited to make a gun.
In the side of the side, there are those who make an improvised gun, "the young streets which are empty, the items used by an improvised gun.
They still have children so they can make weapons not clear that Filipinos have a unique talent.
My point is, why don't you use the talent of Filipinos to build a factory of a gun and bullets so that we will not buy a gun in another country?
If other countries can make a gun and will be exported, why are the Philippines not?
Many good Filipinos and a billion industry are making guns, so instead of buying guns in other countries like America, we should be the one to do.
Just a little training to those committing a gun to do.
Maybe our products are more beautiful than other countries that are now hungry and maybe the day will come, we should be the one to be blamed for them.
We should not remain hanged on the manufacturers of guns in America or in other countries while it is time for them to have them like US Senator Ben Garay, and we do not have weapons.
Who knows, when we started to make a gun, the day will come that we can also make our own airplanes that we could have to make us from the warship, Trillanes IV, and many others needed by the soldiers and police.

I have been convinced that there will be no good effect on the statement of America, World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the past leaders of the Filipinos.
Just like this based on the water service, the government should be vigilant but tasted, which is why the one running, which of course, will be their income first before service.
