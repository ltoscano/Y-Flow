SK Pendatun.

It seems that the rights of the youth are already killed by the local government to make sure that the government will be famous in pushing the government after they push through both camps to push through with the officials of the Sangguniang Kabataan in more than 42,000 barangays in the country.
This is what we see in the events after the Senate gives you in the first version which is being pushed by Senator Bongbong Marcos, leader of the local government committee at the Libingan ng mga Bayani, to have a straight path to SK officials.
The court has made the move of the Senate to force Senator Vicente Sotto and Senate President Franklin Drilon, who should not have a straight path while they are still fixing the reforms in the said sector.
This is also the version of the Lower House but this is more cruel because what the congressmen want are three years old, because aside from the non-bust operation, they also want to be at the national or barangay election in 2016.
This is what is!
In our search, there is no hope to say that all SK Pendatun are corrupt and it is clear that it is a big help in raising the minds of the youth in the field of the government.
We cannot say that all SK Pendatun are sensible, but it is clear that people in general have a crooked and wrong, but many are still on straight work.
It is just like the politicians in the government now because if this is what they know in the current SK Pendatun, they should also separate and reforms that are really plague to the country.
It is hard what our lawmakers want to happen in the issue of SK Pendatun but because they are also worse than their ranks of youth at present, it is just right for them to separate their ranks and set a new standard and election for the "good government official.
