How to avoid cancer: Sickness of Jam?

DOC WILLIE by Doctor Willie T.

I sympathize with the family of Jam Sebastian because of Jam's death from the sickness that reached cancer.
For the fans of Jam and Mabog, it is sad to think about what happened to Jam, to those who did not know them, the lovers Jam and Mogadishu in GMA-7 but they did not succeed at first.
Because of this, Jam thought of doing a video that they would become an actor that reached 8 million pesos.
Their fame continued on YouTube that 2011 to 2014, but in 2014, Jam was surprised and brought to the doctor the doctor discovered that Jam was born on March 4, 2015, Jam said goodbye to the age of 28.

What about cancer?
A cancer or cancer in the lungs is a serious illness that usually see the people who is smoking or putting the smoke of cigarettes (Second-hand).
The symptoms of a cancer are coughing, expectorating with phlegm, a person who has a blood, a person who has a blood, a person or does not want to eat.
According to research, there is a need for 13 times that there is a chance that there will be an extra cancer in the person who loses.
Aside from the cigarette, there are other theories which possibly caused the illness of Jam, staying up late and fatigue, his body weakened.
How can we eat cancer?
1) stop smoking cigarettes, also avoid areas with many smoking such as casino.
2 - do not abuse your body too much, smoking and drinking alcohol, some of our immune system.
3 - rest and have adequate sleep.
4 - do not be too tired of your projects and work.
5 - always pray to God, we do not know where our lives are.
For me, the life of Jam and Maker is a big inspiration.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you have proven that what you are doing is just in your heart, it will be easy for your dream to be moved by God bless.
