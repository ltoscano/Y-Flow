Crying.

(JO 4: 11-18)

When will you last cry?

This is what we first know, even if no one taught us to cry and when we go out of this world, he did not have a child to cry and know how to cry.

It is said that in a post on Facebook: "When you are still young, you have the strength to cry to hear your parents right now, when you do not want to know you are hurt."

There are different reasons of crying because of sadness, or maybe because of happiness.

In good news trends by Maria Magdalena, she also cried.

He is part of his feelings, Jesus is already dead and will surely come upon arriving at the cemetery.

Aside from his resentment, Jesus has already died and he still cannot see his corpse.

That is why when he saw the happiness when she saw Jesus again, she felt happiness when she saw Jesus again and this was once again alive.

When you last cried, hopefully if we are crying, it will cry loudly because Jesus will go back again.
