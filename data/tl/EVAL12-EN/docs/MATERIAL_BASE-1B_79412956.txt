All of our dreams.

Everyday, we are also dreaming of the convenience.
Not dreaming of a better life, even public officials like me.
Included in the dreams of a public servant is a better rating of government employees.
Some cannot believe it, not only for myself but for the good of the country and for the better rating of the government.
One of my dreams is that the government should fix the problem of transportation.
The problem with traffic is that not only in the economy of the country, but also in the livelihood of the people, rich or poor and destroys the trust of all that they are thin with the government.
So my dream is a proper system of transportation.
Maybe many thought that the government does not do anything about the problem of traffic because it seems that he has no solution and is just being forced to accept the problem.
But a lot of education is done by the government about the problem of traffic.
There are many compared to other countries like Singapore and China, especially the popular mass Transportation system of Colombia, which has proven effective and can imitate us.
The government is not blind about the problem of transportation.
But like a dream, study slowly, make sure that every step is right and the cooperation and support of each one is right.
In the studies of the government agencies, they have to give suggestions to the solution of the traffic problem, it is found out that more than 7 million vehicles are in our streets.
Almost 600,000 Filipinos riding the MRT everyday, most of them are employees and students.
In the perfect way, ordinary countrymen who are first affected by the problem of traffic, second are students who are almost all youth.
That is why the dream of those like me to solve the problem of traffic is greater.
Join me in the observation of the traffic problem in the country.
Your opinion can help the government.
