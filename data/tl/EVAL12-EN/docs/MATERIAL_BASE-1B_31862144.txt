Set at Pier in Subic Bay.

Include the negotiation between the Philippines and America in relation to the dozens of presence of the US Military Academy at the country for the construction of the ports or pier.
This is the truth: It is not as well as the previous pier because of the long time since the Americans were built on the US Naval Base in the Subic.
The depth of the water from the pier can anchor so that the big ship will anchor in the pier, "according to the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority official," according to the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority official who pleaded to not mention the name.
Hundreds of millions of dollars are needed to undergo rehab at the pier but the SBMA did not have money for it, it is the money in debt and this 2012 when it started to earn 20 years this history.
It will not rely on the current income of the SBMA the construction of the pier.
It is not possible to just be a nagger until the number of people who are proud of the country will not be useful.
That's why America wants to have the presence of their forces in the country, to them to do or get their obligation, in exchange, aside from other obligation, for the orders of the US Navy.
This is the truth: If America will agree to the proposal, the interest of the entire country can be guarded, the interest of the whole country can be watched against China in the territory of the Philippines in the West Philippines Sea.
There is no problem, according to the SBMA Chairman Roberto V. Garcia, the "joint use" or together with the "Philippine Military Base" which was visited by the forces of America.
According to him, he said, in business and local economy, the additional activities and presence of the Americans are true!
