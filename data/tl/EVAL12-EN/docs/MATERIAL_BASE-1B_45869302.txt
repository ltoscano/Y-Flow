This is a sign of election.

Just like when, we rushed to the voting center and our Presidential countrymen chose to serve the country.
Just a few more months will be held in the election, we are going to be held in the voting center only in May 2013, just for two weeks, the candidates will have to hasten the Commission on Elections (Commission on Elections (Commission on Elections).
The COMELEC set the dates 1 to 5: 00 in the right age to face the confrontation of those who will run in May 2013 election.
This is to give enough time to the COMELEC in a gathering of documents that will be implemented on election.
In the law, it is clear that election campaign will start, but it seems that there are many candidates who are campaigning, but as early as now they are campaigning, but the COMELEC cannot do anything for their early campaign.
In the barangays, those who will run for election will always be seen in the election for birthday and other happiness, this is a sign that election is near.
