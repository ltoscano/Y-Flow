Hoy, if you do not know anything to be silent!

On the issue now that is coming out about the rice case, he is centered on who is the crooked path, "David Tan."
We are not wondering why one of those who are criticizing now are the militant leaders who have also used the strength of "Argeants to.
Do you know the one being used to do it, "the group that was built last the decades" 80 of the murdered CPP-NPA leader, Felicisima "Ka Freddie" Lagman, and now it is headed by "Ka Argee."
In the coming news, identified as Rosendo so, President of the reflection of the rays of the agriculture sector was sent away after he said that only one "ghosts" David Tan, who was only made up by the "Ipit Gang" which is only made by the "Gafia," is no other than DA Sec. Proceso Alcala.
"If you are not (Agawan) known David Tan, it is wrong to say that he is one" in the field of Candelaria, "this is against the sofa of Aziza.
In short, it seems that Agenda in the media said, "the camp of Sec. Alcala is just being deceived by the camp of Secretary Alcala to make the issue on top of its agency.
At this point, the rays leader has a reason for what he said.
In the fact that the observation is, Agenda in the DA / NFA did not have a bad bread, particularly Sec. Alcala, and proof of the numerous cases, including the plunder case that they filed in the Ombudsman.
We do not know what is really his motive, Agawan so that we are going to steal at him.
Just imagine, even in DOJ, Agawan has also filed a complaint against Secretary Alcala.
Is he personally called here or maybe?
