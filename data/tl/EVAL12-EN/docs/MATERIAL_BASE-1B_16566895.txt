Manila, clean and Lord Jesus.

The devotees of the Lord Jesus Christ or the Black Nazarene should not be ignored.
It is certain that millions of millions, will attend the procession for him on Thursday, January 9, 2014, in Quiapo, Manila.
We can hear that many devotees will come out of the belief that he will help them run over by typhoon Yolanda in this year, especially in Metro Manila and nearby provinces.
Fear, judicial oy, which is really a reason why devotees will increase in the procession.
And like the past years, one or two days only, some are walking from far away places just to get a handkerchief or a towel to him in the said day.
Their belief, it is lucky that the Nazarene gets safe from the calamity.
Hopefully all this will be true.
It is difficult for Yolanda to take care hit.
Because the devotees are just living together, they should also consider it out.
Because of the number of devotees from different cities and towns going to Quiapo, every night and about to go after the procession, the entire Metro Manila should be guarded.
We say this because of the garbage scattered anywhere from Christmas and New Year.
There are a lot of speeding jeepneys, damaged firecrackers, including powerful Goodbye Napoles, Super Yolanda, Alum or bomb and many others.
It is still different that garbage is low, galvanized iron, cut off and other are still scattered and have been used to increase in protest movement, restaurant and others.
You will reach an accident, make an accident, if you will be stepped on any of them.
For example, the action of the government is not enough for cleaning, very beautiful to look and support the ranks of the residents of the barangay.
If we can do it, let us also let the "Tfour, I am clean," the program. "
For us all the cleanliness.
Then we should blame the Herodes of Pilot and corruption after.
