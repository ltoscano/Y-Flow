Chito Tagle (LE. 4-37) one of the best speaker during the time now is no other than Cardinal Tagle, he is very intelligent that he loves to read.

He also knows how to listen to the minds of other people and because he is very good to talk, many get her to become Speaker. But where does he get the people listening to him?

I remember the story of our classmate in Tagaytay City even if she became the Bishop, he still remained to an instructor of MG that's always put in the morning in the chapel in order to pray.

I once thought for Bishop to front of the chapel in order to pray that's why she was still early to wake up and go to the chapel.

He was greatly shocked because when he entered the chapel, Bishop Tagle is there who's praying, that is the reason why she was fooled by Bishop Tagle with power and truth and this is the result of her prayer and giving thanks to the Lord.

Her message and actions are coming from the friendship with God, isn't it that the people who are saving by Jesus will be united in order to be alone and to talk to God, so that many people need to keep quiet and socialize.

For Jesus, what he is doing is a result of her relationship with his Father, this is the one asked by the people: "He also has power over his words," this is also what we should imitate.

Everything we talked about is coming from talking to God, all the things that we are doing and coming from our friends to God.
