Meow, Congressman Manny!

Our pambansang kamao, Congressman Manny "Pacman" Pacquiao, will win against the strong American boxer Chris Algieri yesterday in Macau.
The statement of Algieri is right that he is faster than some of the opponents of Pacman similar to Timothy Bradley when Algieri showed that he would be healed - just the first round, it is up to the first round.
To the critics of Pacman who is taller than her, Algieri is different because before, they will just go through when he tasted the fist of Pacman.
But Algieri is really torn from the first shouting, even if he still has not tasted the strength of Pacman, he has not tasted the strength of Pacman.
In the first time of Pacman's race he showed his lessons that he learned when he was able to sleep in the fight because of his weight to bring down the veteran boxer, Juan Manuel Marquez.
Pacman did not win back then, Marquez had a chance to break the storage room and nose in those hours, because many have thought that Pacman would die because he has been buried there for a long time and not moving.
It has been a number of fights that Pacman has eaten after his bitter experience, but his style is different, but he does not want to go there when he goes there.
Maybe Floyd "Boogie" Mayweather "Mayweather Jr., Jr. who does not have no losses like Algieri. Daang Matuwid" because he was able to arrest Mayweather but he does not want to fight.
Again, the greeting to Cong. Manny Pacquiao is silent! The whole country will be silent for the fight of Pacman and Algieri on how, the police and criminals are looking, the soldiers and rebels will look into each other.
Of course, like before, the fight of Pacman in boxing is not yet finished because the battle of Pacman is more intense, waiting for Pacman against the queen of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) back to the country, Gooduck, Manny!
