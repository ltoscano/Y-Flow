Invest in Southern Tagalog.

The National Democratic Front of Southern Tagalog (NDF-ST) is full of gratitude that the workers, farmers, small fishermen and poor fishermen were damaged, particularly in the regions of Bicol and Central Luzon and in Metro Manila.
NDF-halo is calling all the constricted forces of the region and local units of the New People's Army (NPA) to bring the highest number of transportation operations which can give a temporary relief to the victims of calamity that will give additional relief to the victims of calamity.

More than the typhoons and earthquake that are experienced by the country because of the emedical location of the country, it should be given attention by the calamities being brought by the Abaya and lack of fear of the citizens in waiting and monitoring the possible effect of the calamity.

Instead of putting on his time with the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) and to the members of his cabinet such as Abad and Alcala, the local companies in facing the environment, lives and livelihood of the citizens should not be disregarded.

Every calamity that used in the country will leave a deep wound in the citizens who will be covered by worry because the people will not be charged with their own lives and livelihood, which is why the citizens will rise and bring them to his final resting place.
