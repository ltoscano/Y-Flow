So thank you very much to our teachers.
According to October 6, 2016, one of the most important pillars of our society aside from our parents and family is our teachers, they are the ones responsible for the future of our children because almost in the whole day they will be with each other every day they enter the school.
When I was still studying in elementary, I remembered that I was happy because every time I have a problem with our fellowmen, I am ready to give me a little time for me to be able to give me a little time so I could not have a good teacher when I am still studying.
If the teacher of a child is far away, it is not easy to learn and there will be a good attitude and attitude, if a child is not in good attitude, it is for me, our teachers, one of the real heroes of our country.

There are different problems that they are facing every day, like the lack of books, classrooms and equipment but some of them still need to walk in the rivers and sea just to reach the schools in the mountains while some of them still need to walk a few kilometers in order to reach the schools in the islands.
Last Wednesday, the whole world reminisced the World, "Day, which is why I want to offer my column to give recognition and thanking the teachers of your children, hopefully you also thank them and to make them think that they are important for all of us.
