This is no brake, ETC.

An accident happened at the EDSA-Magallanes last Thursday morning where six died and many were wounded after a bus driver lost its brakes.
Whether it is true or not, for me, there is only one who can blame the accident like this, aside from the driver of bus, this is very good at the Land Transportation Office.
The agency of the government that is fond of treatment and even the blind are being given licenses now, why are you a witness to the initial examination results from the LTO, it came back to the machine, led to Written In!
Now, how can they give a license to those who are not worthy to drive on our streets?
There is no effect on the trend of LTO to this LTO.
That's why the accidents continue because of the useless drivers, whether rich or rich, whether rich or new, will continue.
Even in the check-up of the vehicle, they do not really do it, wouldn't it be that every year there is being conducted by Registration Authority in order to find out if one vehicle is still on top of it?
Or, how is it that the buses are registered to have no brake? Driver or even a defect of the vehicle, it is still LTO who has shortcomings as well.
You, Kabayan, who should be blamed? Who should be blamed?
Um!
