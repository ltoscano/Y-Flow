A heart disease (MPS 1-6)

A heart.

Blind, it is hard to be blind but the blind can't be seen in popularity, and eventually, he can't see the beauty of different colors as the beauty of different colors.

But there is a blindness of its eyes, the heart is getting worse if she is angry when we are angry when we plant anger and resentment when we have a high blood and good thing that we cannot see the beauty and good of other people.

The fellowmen of Jesus are also blind, their hearts are blind because of the kindness that they have heard from the goodness that they have heard from the goodness that they have received many times like them, our hearts are becoming blind, that is why our hearts are becoming blind.

Anna blindness, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, the doctors can only look after himself to set himself closer to Jesus and open the heart for change.

You want your heart to see yourself now to free yourself and remove his pride and get to know the goodness of others.
