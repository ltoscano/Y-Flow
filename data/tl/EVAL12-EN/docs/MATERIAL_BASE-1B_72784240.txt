Amazing is the bathroom of Abaya?

The price of MRT here is the US $300-million Kotong for the wagons for the MRT and now, the price in NAIA has been stopped in NAIA.
In the data of expenses in the comfort room of the toilet for the bathroom of NAIA, the P26.9 thousand per one?
Oh, Mister Jun Abaya, you might get full of blessings, you are filled with the size of your income from the DOTC, due to the country you are full of problems.
I remember last year, Sec. Abaya is famous that he will push for the modern transportation in the whole country using Private-Public Actor in the entire country using Private-Public Market Office of his buddy, Benigno Aquino 3rd.
That's why when his first PPP-ray has been removed from the newspaper, the bidding "in all the comfort room and bathroom in the airports.
The reason is simple, who is the stupid contractor, and our airports in the bathroom are simple, and for the expenses just to bring them their things and personnel.
However, maybe their contractor is already regretting it, if they just know that there are almost 300 thousand in a toilet, well, because of the volume of foolishness of airports, even if they have faults, they will almost be crushed!
Asked by the tricycle drivers in a Toda, Mam lily, "gold to the bathroom of Jun Abaya?"
Here is the contract of the DOTC by Abaya, the PNR that is like the MRT, after a while, their trains have been destroyed so that even the Rail Transit are being destroyed, so as it was being destroyed, "Hoy said, do not ride in!"
The comfort room in the MRT himself is almost broken and if there is something to do, how much is one, so how much is the price like NAIA, G. Abaya?
Anyway, his / her mother was big as well as he said, "she could not avoid being born in a silver." So she does not want to pee or stop the ordinary bathroom.

Lily's nape, lily.
