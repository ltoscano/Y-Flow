Philippine Army, being harassed, 4.

Diego.
Normandie Pharisees!
25, February 2014.

The bickering of offensive against a fisherman who was included in the 49th Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army was successful in the 19th of February 2014 in Brgy. Barangay Patonganding, Camarines Sur, a few more than 12: 15, and with 3 others who were not able to block the courageous military assets.
The episode is to response to the wide call of the citizens to encourage the government troops that are part of human rights violation, this is the opposite of the destruction of human rights in Barangay Patintero, Camarines Sur.

Oplan Galugad, disappointed!
Digaynon, should be maintained!
