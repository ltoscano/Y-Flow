We can say: Marcos is the next VP?
According to October 25, 2016 while President Rodrigo "Rody" Duterte is in the country China, he said in front of the Filipinos there that it is possible that Bong Bong Marcos will possibly be the next Vice President of our country.
Why did Duterte say this, it very clear that Vice President Leni Robredo did not know that he does not know that Duterte and his allies are planning to move from his position, or maybe it is not helpful to have a real unity for our country.
Many supporters of Robredo were irritated with what Duterte did because for them, it seems that Duterte did not respect the decision of the people in the past elections, let us remember that Duterte's decision was also a member of the cabinet and the official family of Duterte, that is why it was really surprising that Duterte said words.
Hopefully our President will not speak like this so that the disagreement of the supporters of Robredo will be avoided.
It is good that Robredo did not pay attention to the words of Duterte while his supporters were furious at anger and annoyed, only Robredo and no longer spoke about this issue.
Robredo showed that he has respect for our president and he does not have any plan to fight it because Robredo said that he prioritize the unity of the country even if he was hurt with what Duterte said.
Robredo is really admirable because it is not for the exhaustion of 22 hours that it will lead to Cagayan and Isabela last Friday to visit and send help to our countrymen who were devastated by typhoon Lawin.
It can be seen here that Robredo has a real concern for every Filipino because even if he lost a lot in this province last election, he will immediately go there to make the government's help for them to make sure that the leaders of our government, like she has a real love for every Filipino.
