OCAIDs.

The officials of Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) were surprised by the quick reaction of the Olongapo City Arts and Culambo ation, Incorporated (OCAAP), which was built by the US Navy in Subic when they were added.
This is the truth: A Nida Rojas, an accounting representative of OCAAP), contrary to what we said that he is not yet operating until now, November 2013 when they were already tomorrow.
It will be together with Rojas' letter to the "tanim-bala" in a few transaction, particularly a wedding last April 19, 2013 within February 14, 2014 at the amount of P17590; and golden retriever, last March 29, 2014 to P45,750.
There is no income from the months of January, April, May, May and June, that is why the earnings of OCACalaguas for seven months since it opened is P7470.50.
Because this is not the rent of the SBMA based on the contract, there is a white number 7,7,340 per month for more than 9,000 340 per month for more than 9,000 340 per month for more than 9,000 640 per month for more than 9,000 pesos per month for more than 9,000 pesos per month for more than 9,000 pesos per month.
This is the truth: Many want to earn big and pay a lot to Admiral's guests but when it was not given by the former administration of the SBMA but it did not fulfill it, instead, the former building has not fulfilled, instead, he did not fulfill it, instead, he did not fulfill it, instead, he didn't know.
This is the current Board of directors that in spite of the repeated failure of the OCAAP) under the set time, the provincial officials did not know it until November 2013, and it is not yet allowed to have no permit for the suspension of the agencies that have something to do with a engineering, x-term for others.
Even the receipt to other transactions inside the seven months will only be disconcerting, it means that, the Bureau of Internal Revenue or BIR, this is one of the violation of human rights.
This is the truth: Instead of going to fix it, the OCAAP) made its excuse that is why our story has no direct effect on the Saligang Batas, which is expected to clean by the SBMA since he is said to have nothing to meddle.
It is really a different kind, "is it right Chairman?" It is the Philippine National Historical Commission on purpose that is useless and no benefit is the truth!
