Witnesses: The talent of Doc!
Jimmy and Jimmy Cantos, July 30, 2016, I thought there is no care for a professional with events in sports in the country but I am surprised with what my friend, doctor said last Thursday.
His first question to me is why it still wants to be the Philippine Football Committee President Jose Cojuangco, while there are still many young blood there who are ready to replace.
We have talked to BOC C because of the incoming social Olympics where sixteen Filipinos are included in the coming days because when the Olympics comes, people are really waiting for the fight of the filipino athletes, especially in boxing.

Now, he added that the Filipino sports fans are not interested on who knows the two boxers to fight in Rio de Jetti? (The two are Yen Laden and Charly Suarez.
We have also discussed what happened to the Manila Electric Quitago Elementary School which was met by Gilas Pilipinas against France and New Zealand.
Doc said, in the beginning, Gilas Herrero is only in the beginning, he has not been tired and forth in the third time, but when it comes to the fourth time, the shoulders of Doc has not been exhausted.
Doc also added, that if Bira will come here he is in a good condition, but if he will come here, the stomach will have a big stomach and is just like the commercial drivers of a milk.
Doc has also mentioned what is really what the team wants to happen with the PBA, if they want to be helped in Gilas if they just want to be helped in Gilas if they will only be helped in the fields at the PBA.
I could not answer because until now, it is still not clear where the program of Gilas Pilipinas and what will be the role of the PBA.
What is clear now is the colonization of the Pacific Economic Cooperation compared the PBA and we know that the PBA officials are allergic to these kinds of events.

My goodness, your life is still alive but Doc, your skill.
