There is no delicadeza.

There are no doubts that are competing in the lower part of the face by President Aquino, even though they have left the right failure and almost every day, they will get closer to their respective positions.
What they do not know is that in every day they remain in their position, especially when the president does not know that the president does not know anything to walk in our country.
He is starting to look like a useless President because the members of his cabinet are worthless.
It is possible that they are not recognized by the word delicadeza and no concern for PNoy.
This is just an example of Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) General Manager Angel Honrado who has also made it a number of times for his leadership the Ninoy Aquino International Airport is almost the next one. "
The ceiling of our airports also fell for several times because of the useless administration of Honrado himself.
Even the Adelbert (ATM) inside the airport is often seen.
The worse part is the armed people get into the arrival of the airport to fulfill the killing of Mayor Ukol Talumpa of Labangan, Zamboanga del Sur, his wife, nephew and one of the coming passengers last Friday.
A simple security guard is not able to do with the actual gate of NAIA that can be considered as a High School, or a place where it should have been strict security because it is a huge disaster that can happen if the terrorists will pass here.
What if the motorcycle that was used was full of bomb, and those who were conducting the murder were not allowed to kidnap or terrorists?
After all, if the proper maintenance of our airports can't be done?
In other countries, if there are kinds of events, the pet officials immediately resigned from their position because they cannot bear to face shame but here in the administration of PNoy, there is really a trend among the officials that there is no gap between the administration of PNoy.
First of all, GM Bodet Honrado himself.
