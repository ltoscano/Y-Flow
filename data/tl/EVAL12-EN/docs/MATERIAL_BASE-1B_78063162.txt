Principle is important to PNoy.

Cambodians of June Senator Panfilo Lacson advised the Philippines through discussion on his speech at the 25th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit who were united in resolving the territory of the members, and there is no need for the meddling of other countries.
President Benigno Aquino and contradicted the statement of June on the reason why the discussion about the disputed territory of the Philippines and China has increased again, we know that Cambodia is an ally of China, which is why we are at a disadvantage.
But because PNoy has a resolve, he did not pay attention to it if he is only one of his allies against eight or nine members of the ASEAN who are against the resolution of the coming of the United States and will not join the United States and other countries who are members of the United Nations.
This is not the first time President Noynoy stood up in relation to our own territory by China, we know that we are aware of us, that is why we know that his opposition will be impressed by PNoy that even though he knows that his opposition to June will still stand for him.
Many say that we do not have any opponent in China who is one of the most powerful countries in the world but he was not stunned by President Aquino although he is expecting that we will increase again to the harassment of the said powerful country.
It is only right that PNoy showed that he will not be afraid of or afraid to China because even the right path is not only the "straight path, but also the right path, which is why it should just run after the United Nations.
PNoy insisted on the principle that we are not allowed to serve our neighboring countries because even them have interest on the other parts of our country that we want to get and monopolize the property.
That is why I admire President Aquino because of its principle and skill in opposition to those who want to protect our country in relation to our own territory that's why it continues to continue his fight against the parts of our country which is forcefully claiming of the neighboring country.
