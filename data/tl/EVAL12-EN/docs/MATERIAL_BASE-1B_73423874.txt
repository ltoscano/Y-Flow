It is hard to see a good spouse, according to the book of Kawasan, most of the expensive jewelry that we are doing and not evil, I also told them that there is no good care for each other and there is a good care for each other because they are assigned by God.
So in all the churches of the church, the couple is the only ones in the corner of the church, they are able to get along with the corners of life and love, to God, and when one is gone, the part of their life will fall, and the result of their love, the child is there.
I do not know that sometimes my wife is busy with their church, drinking or friends, sometimes her husband is busy with his business or in another country, we rarely see the love of God to improve the love of God, and this is the true wealth of the Lord.
God can make it equal to us, every one of us has intelligence in different kinds of level in our life, and we should take care of our intelligence and it is better for us not to imitate the Lord: "That is why there is still no progress and it is not even if you are slowly getting married."
