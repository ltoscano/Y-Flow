Let us not imitate even the king-T by Mayor, to destroy them.

Critics of Puerto Princesa, Palawan Mayor Cecile Bayambang did not think that he will win with the graft case because according to the knowledge of everyone in the area, it was said that their opponent is said to use money and medical services but Mayor Bayodo is still chosen by those from Puerto Princesa.
There is no record that cheated and he also does not use money and he also does not have any decision during the time of the campaign and only his own weapon is his clean intention to serve the people in their area.
That is why the residents of Puerto Princesa was given to him the whole heart to lead the city.
What's painful is that, Mayor Bayas is just seated as mayor and he is just starting from his service he is planning to destroy the other camp so that if Mayor Bayambang is afraid, they will find it hard to defeat them.
That's why there, while the mayor is not able to serve as well, they are forcing to suppress them and make out that the people have no trust on him.
The question: Who really is behind this plan, maybe even if it is not mentioned here, you already know who is behind this.
