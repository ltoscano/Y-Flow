Our police is diligent in the launch of anti-drug operations in the compliance of President Rodrigo Duterte's directive.
In fact, as time passes, there are more people who are involved in the illegal operation of illegal drugs.
Along with the increasing number of those who are involved in the syndicate of illegal drugs, many of our fellow countrymen are giving up to the government, most of those who are giving up to the government, most of those who are giving up to the government, so they have voluntarily surrendered and become bloody and violent, which is why these are blind and violent.
But do you know that among all the common success in the campaign against illegal drugs, there are some of high officials who should be distributed, because the Philippine National Police (PNP) will never be achieved by the Philippine National Police (PNP).
That's why we salute PNP Chief Ronald "stones" dela Rosa who are tired so all the anti-drug operations are becoming successful.
Aside from PNP Chief dela Rosa, it is also a big help of course for the operation against illegal drugs as the National Capital Regional Office (NCRPO) Acting Director Police Chief Superintendent Oscar Albayalde, the most hard work for the government in order to become positive in the operation that they are preparing for in Metro Manila.
But this mother is very popular because in spite of their own success, he always teases his colleagues to each success of their operation.
Aside from the colleagues, Supt. Albayalde believes that the NCRPO will not achieve the success if there is no unity among the people that we think can help.
In spite of this success, the official is still not contented because he is calling the public to cooperate and give importance to the public to help and give importance to the actions of the NCRPO in NCRPO celebration, Instagram account (NCRPO-Reguera and Facebook account (NCRPO-React or Pio-NCRPO.
