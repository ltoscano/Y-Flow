Castro in China? By Al G. Mendoza July 31, 2016.
If the news of Inquirer's news is true, I should only be because of a sports station in Inc.), we celebrate Jason Castro.
Castro is said to be playing in China basketball player) if it will push through, he will earn no less than P14 million from November to February.
So that it will happen, Castro will leave the TNT Katsidis in August 31, the contract of Castro in TNT Katropa bench, and when there is no new contract, there is 2-month training in China before the league of November 2016.
With the infidelity of Mushatch, Castro is still asking for permission from MVP, the owner of the Trefaldighets.
It is normal for the official asking the blessing from your boss during the time of his / her own boss such as well as well.
And probably, MVP is full of heart.
Although there is a big amount of P420,000 per month now by Castro in TNT Katropa bench, it is much more than 3.5 million monthly salary of Castro when it continued to China.
If I am MVP, you will wait for a chance to give birth to Castro, it is an honor for him to give him like Castro, for 2 times, became a member of the Myles-5 in 2013 FAsia Cup and 2016 Fotoplay.
I was surprised when he / she was woken up, Castro in Gilas well, together with FIFA, de Ocampo, and this is not right now.
