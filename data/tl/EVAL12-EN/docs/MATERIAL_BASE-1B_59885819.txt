Should I believe what Binay is against Binay?

Severe is the revelation of former Makati City Vice Mayor Ernesto Mercado against VP Jojo Binay.
It's because VP Binay allegedly received a former mayor of Makati with 13 percent in all activities in the city.
In the said parking building of Phase 1, Mister Jojo is said to receive P52-million and that is according to Mercado's statement.
If it is not an analysis, it can be watched and reading the news about this, you will really believe Mercado even if it is clear that he will release a bad feelings towards the Binay because he is defeated by Mayor "Junjun" Binay last 2010 election.
It is clear that Mercado's action is very clear and it is clear that the defamation to VP Jojo is only a priority for the people that he will bring to Malacanang because it is clear in the past survey that almost 40 percent of Filipinos are in favor of the leadership of Binay as the next president of the country.
It is also clear that Senator Alan Cayetano and Antonio Trillanes is also clear in politics because they have the same interest for the presidency of the Philippines.
It cannot be denied that the former vice mayor of Makati also has a motive to destroy the entire Binay family because he wants to return to politics in the city.
In the short explanation, it is personal interest in Mercado, Trillanes and Cayetano in their destruction to Binay and that is what the citizens should study and have lead to the citizens.
Many of the names and integrity of Binay will surely come that is why we should be careful of the research and belief because all of these have a trace of politics.
The case to be filed in court is the solution on the issue being thrown to VP Binay and that is what Cayetano should do because they are using the Senate in politicking so that they will continue to talk about the town of ALNAs Windyhill, Alvin Feliciano.
