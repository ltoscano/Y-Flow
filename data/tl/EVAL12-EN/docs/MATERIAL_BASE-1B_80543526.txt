Amazing, meow!

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) ordered the agency of the government to tell us to monitor our environment.
The businesses that are related to the use of natural resources of the Philippines like robots should be guarded by DENR so they will not be abused, and have benefits not only for the businessmen but for the whole country.
But what there was a news coming out about a company of mining that destroyed the environment and did not escape from the monitoring of DENR, the company was reported to have been released by a mountain in Barangay Bolitoc, Santa Cruz, Zambales and used the land from the said mountain in order to create their own ports for the operation of their mining in the area.
It is surprising that the operation of P5,000 is not suspended despite the protest of the residents of the said area and despite the proof that the demolition of the mountain was intentional.
The court has already found out where the petition of the writ of nature against hazing, is the disrespect of mining companies in the environment.
It is clear that the court said this past August, which causes danger is cause danger not only to the residents of Barangay Bolitoc in Santa Cruz, Zambales but also in the entire province and nearby provinces like Pangasinan.
The question is severe for Secretary Paje.
Why?
Not only DENR was allowed to be affected by Paje here but also President Noynoy Aquino.
Remember that the industry of mining does not want to recover from the administration of Aquino, because, when our country is rich, even if our country is rich, if the environment will be taken cared of if mining will be allowed in the country.
If this is what will be done by DENR, and it will make its way to DENR, many will get mad and may even be angry and even decent companies in mining can be punished because of the foul acts done by the few.
