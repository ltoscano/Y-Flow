In the middle of the calamity.

In the middle of the calamity, Bohol and Cebu were affected by flood and Cebu, many lives were lost because many buildings fell.

Many roads were destroyed and a lot of old churches were destroyed, but there is a church whose walls are destroyed and the ceiling was destroyed, and in the middle of the vendors, the image of Mama Mary was standing.

It seems that he did not even put the collapse.

Maybe it is also saying that even the church gets destroyed but not the faith of people, the church is still alive, but we believe that the church is still alive, but let us continue to pray for those affected by this calamity, we continue to pray to those affected by this calamity.
