Toni Gonzaga-hearted.
A mad dog.
It seems like I was made into a mysterious words, from my walking outside of the house until I wrote to my first column, I still don't know what really wants to say, this word or where it came from.
Just like all who are responsible, I looked for an meaning on the internet, I found out that the meaning of a mad dog is stupid, a different thing that only means a picture of the dog with rabies.
Mad, my mother said that she is so tender towards me, he still hasn't been in writing to the office while I still haven't been able to go back to the office while I still haven't been on my head because I left him and where I left him and where I left him.
A crazy dog, said to be a student of those who have been able to go out of their room to go out of a protest, that is why they will not hear the meaningful lesson that their professor was preparing, because even if they do not go to class, they are asking for additional budget for education.
Four letters, it turns out that the meaning of that in his post, it is just easy to carry out and it seems that it is easy to get carried away from the mouth, but when it was released, there might be a simple comments or insult, this isn't a simple comments or insult, which is why he uttered it.
If you are a good student, you should not stay in class if you do not have a good reason, like bad weather and illness, that is why they should go home to the right age, and it is only right for you to go home to the right age, which is why they're only looking at the right age as well.
It is better for us to be afraid of these dates and for those who patronize them, aside from these kinds of freedom, progress and change that this is set to serve as beneficiary of a standard, it would be better if I want to be one of the human beings.
