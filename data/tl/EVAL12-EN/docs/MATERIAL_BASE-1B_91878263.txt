Pacman will fight.

Congressman Manny Pacquiao's whole future depends on the result of his fight against Timothy Bradley this day.
This is at the Pambansang Kamao in his rematch with Bradley because even his livelihood and dreams in politics are former based on the result of his fight in Las Vegas.
Even the big part of the payment of Pacman for his big debt in the tax of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, it depends on the upcoming fight so everyone is watching over the outcome of the said funeral fight between the Pambansang Kamao because there are already many who are noticing that he gets pregnant.
Even his dreams in politics are like senator in politics, Vice President Jojo Binay depends on the fight that is why he should keep it well.
Of course, if the victory of Pacman will be released, he will rise again to the Filipinos, but, if he is defeated, he will surely fall down, especially his political ambition in the country.
Even his sympathy to the high weight of society is also based on his success so we can say that this is a possible fight in the life of Pacman.
In a short word, this is the hope of Pacman to recover, not only in the world of boxing but also in the general aspect of his life because this is where he will be tested.
The time is too short for the Pambansang Kamao so he should be able to focus on his full force on his fight against Bradley because he will surely have faults when he will give in this fight.
It is time to fight Pacman's enemy, which is why he needs to pour this because many say that our Pambansang Kamao has already passed away.
