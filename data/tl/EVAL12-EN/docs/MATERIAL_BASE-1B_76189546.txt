According to the World Bank, the widespread corruption is the cause of being put in a blender in the country, the money that the government should start in the Job Fair they should be surprised with corrupt politicians.
If Vice President Jojo Binay is going to be president or is Mar Roxas in 2016, will it be finished for the widespread corruption against him, that is why it seems that Binay will not be imprisoned because of the strength of corrupt Liberal Party which is why even if it is not corrupt, corruption will continue to be imprisoned because of the strength of corrupt and poverty in the country.
And about what Binay became a lawyer, and he knows that it is against the security of the Constitution and Labor Law that he became mayor of Makati from 1986 when he was replaced by his wife and even his son had done something against illegal immigrants?
And Mar Roxas, what did you do?
So, who can be expecting that we will rise from the type of workers in 2016?, Grace Poe, so it seems that it is not because his party is corrupt Liberal Party.
PNoy, so it seems like he wants to undergo-elect, as long as he wants to have a platforms on the goals of Rose Alexis Rojo, because he was also a member of the Cabinet's goal, but why is he still not being fired?
