True love.

The start of love is to let our loved ones allow them to be blind according to what they want, that they cannot get to know their own image (image) because if we do not do it, our loved ones are the ones that we need to see in them.

Always remember that the most powerful force on the skin of the land is love that there is nothing more important than you, while the happiness of your loved one is much more important than you, while when you love your surroundings, it is more important than you, especially when you have someone who love you, especially when you love your right.
