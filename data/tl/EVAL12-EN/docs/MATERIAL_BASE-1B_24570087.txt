BoC-pinworm medicine.

Christmas season is near and this time, it will surely spread fake things that are being sold in markets, Divisoria, and even in malls, without care of their fake ways to sell their fake things.
Which is why in the end, the poor are the public who thought of having a jackpot with a gunshot wound which is said to be coercion.
That's why Customs Commissioner Ruffy Biazon will be alert for his personnel at the dock to be on guard in order to stop the entry of Lefeasts in the country because they were caught in different kinds of fake things.
And a company who burned the name of Tello City International Trucking) is what brought the country by said fake goods that costs 60 million pesos.
It was as if they were not carried out by the company because it was only a second time when he was caught with counter-selling goods.
Temyong declared the cargo trucks, battery, shoes, shoes, food and clothes, and other parts of the motorcycle, which is needed by Clearance or 120,269 people, which is needed by Clearance or other products which have been needed by Clearance or other products from the country of China and arrived in Port of Manila.
According to BOC commissioner, their style is not declaration of the right content of the cargo trucks to avoid paying proper taxes.
So if it is thought that Biazon will just forget his right to correct the AOIL, this is a mistake of diler.
You will reach the hands of BOC on anywhere or whatever way you do for the smuggling.
But this is Temyong Lanticse and broker, they might feel pity for them last August 17, wow, even though it was thought that some Biazon team has thought to be imprisoned.

Again, we will give thanks to the current leadership of Commissioner Ruffy Biazon.
