Noche buena, 2013 (change.

Circus in 2013.

Change.

The person who does not want to change whatever you do, will still not change?

Sometimes, I was able to talk to a priest that she wanted to talk to a priest so she could share what she was going through.

Even his wife has a fight if he goes home to his parents' house.

"We talked for a long time in the end he said:" Father, you will not trust me with my mother-in-law, "I just smiled.

A person if he does not want to change, others can't do anything, even if he is not doing anything to change, even if the Pope did not change, even if the Pope did not change until he doesn't want to change until now, there is still no change.

Change is a personal decision if we are carrying a lot of things inside the change and not outside.

Sometimes we think that other people should change.

We are waiting for others to get along with us.

Even if it is hard to change himself, do not wait for others to change even if they are wrong. "I will add to the understanding, I will be more kind to him, that I will love her more."

Do not wait for others to change because you themselves will change for them!
