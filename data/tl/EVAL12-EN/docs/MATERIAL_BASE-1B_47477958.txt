Forgiveness.

Forgiveness (Less. 17-1)... that if it is a seven times that she has been against you for a day and if we do not want to forgive him, we should not let him forgive him, but if we don't want to forgive him, we should not be forgiven.

Jesus wants to forgive so that we will just be defeated by our self, we will just be defeated by a person if someone is carrying a person who does not have anything wrong to forgive, for forgiveness, a task that forgive us to be free!
