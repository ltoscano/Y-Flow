Shameless!

"There are really" pul-politicians who have no embarrassment, why don't you think that even if the people does not want to continue with President Benigno Aquino III, he still wants to continue with the lawmakers that if the president just wants to continue this task.
Because the funds for the education and medical team in their jurisdiction is here, the Department of Education (DepEd) and the Department of Health (DOH) and the Department of Health (DOH) should be given to the nation's needs to answer the needs of the people.
The job of lawmakers made a law and does not make hope on pork barrel that should be for the public.

Heard Bartolome said that it will lead to one o'clock in the truth that it is going to free, but I have a feeling that it will finish the corruption, but I can say that the culture of lack of responsibility or culture of Norcia can come from the lack of shame to the people trusted by the people who are trusted.
Notice that if the "pul-politicians have a shame, they will not be a thief; if the workers have a shame; if the people have a shame; if a person has a shame, it will not be done by shame because it is just a few of them to make shame to the people.
You, are you a shame?

In spite of the saying that Ferdinand Marcos was running, the reason why he sold the Martial Law in September of 21, 1972, I have a feeling that this is right to be treated in fact that Marcos was the one who noticed this illness but the hero, Dr. Jose Rizal.
It's just a waste that what Marcos did was not right and did not make the right to change the society because it is tainted with his personal interests, but he is tainted with personal interests, but he is replaced by a cratic.
He built his common people and had made the streets into debt but he insisted on the country's debt but he gave the people's debt, but he was given to the Philippine Army, but he made the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
The opportunity given to him / her fate is really a waste when will we still be sent away from the shameless and good treasury?

If you want to take a bath in a private Starex van, you went to the Infines Subdivision, Barangay Bagong Kalsada, City of Calamba, just near Metro Manila and from here, you are looking forward to the holy mountain.
