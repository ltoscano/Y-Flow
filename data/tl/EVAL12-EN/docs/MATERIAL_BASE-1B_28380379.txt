What Pacquiao and the Filipinos are.

Manny Pacquiao will allegedly hit Jessie Vargas.
It is a good thing that Pacquiao has been saying that it is surprising if I will be asked: 9-1 because the lead of Pacquiao.
There are even those who can make it as Vargas, because, your nine million pesos for Pacquiao will only earn a peso.
I am also wondering.
World haunting is Vargas in WBO welterweight division but why is it that many admire him?
The record of Vargas was good at 27 wins, only one loses.
The winner is a thorn and stain on his record because the loses of Vargas will be given to Tim Bradley.
Isn't Pacquiao's favorite to defeat Pacquiao?
Among the three Pacquiao-Bradley fight, Pacquiao has two wins and he should have been deceived during the first fight.

In November 6 (Phl-time) in Las Vegas, it is said that Pacquiao is going to sleep in Las Vegas, according to Freddie Roach, the bullying of Pacman.
For me, Pacquiao will only win and it can be better if it happened, he is the first senator in the whole world who will become the world upside down.
It is an honor again not only to Pacquiao but also a loved country.
Hopefully Pacquiao is really in good condition.
Pacquiao's dignity is the integrity of Pacquiao.
