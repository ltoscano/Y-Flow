San Lorenzo.

San Lorenzo Ruiz-year-36, a Filipino went to the Catholic Church in Japan when they arrived there, they were arrested and imprisoned.

They were tortured so that he / she was tortured so that he was not abandoned by the Catholic Church, he said, "I was a Catholic and full of gratitude for the Lord.

If I will have a thousand of life, all that I offer to him / her. "He died while holding the faith of Christ, that is the first Filipino he was declared.

Now that we are commemorating our hearts, let us remember what he has done in Jesus.

Faith is not just a private thing but it should also be shared by Cardinal Rosales: "Where Filipinos are there, the honesty of God is brought by the Filipino." San Lorenzo Ruiz, pray for us!
