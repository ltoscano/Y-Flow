The Senate supports the ongoing investigation of President Rodrigo Duterte to the local government units (LGUs) to find out where the success he gave is going to be given to them.
One Special bodies will be held by the President to investigate the LGUs.
President Duterte pushed the investigation because of the failure of local government officials they should fix the garbage in their vicinity, according to President Duterte, LGUs should be fixed on their jurisdiction because they have sufficient funds for this.
As the support in the investigation being pushed, Senator Loren Legarda said that the LGUs cannot be able to get out of not following the law of the solid management because aside from having a law to fly to, the law's statements were said to be coercion.
The law regarding the proper throwing of garbage or Egiddy, Solid Waste Management (EWSM) Law or Republic Act 9003 is already 15 years old.
The goal of the law is to have a clean environment through using the system of solid disposal of garbage, "lack of garbage worth of garbage, meat processing.
It is sad because even the small problem that should be focused on by LGUs is being given attention by the president, an indication to fix the mayor and governor that does not care about the cleanliness of their jurisdiction.
It is only right to investigate the LGU who have no action in order to maintain cleanliness in their jurisdiction when there is enough value allocated for it.
We believe that a person like President Duterte should really need to serve the mayor and governor who forget to be part of their duties in fulfilling the cleanliness and order of their jurisdiction.
