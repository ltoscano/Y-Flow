I refused with what he likes By Kuya Rom this November 25, 2016.
Dear Kuya Rom.
I and my girlfriend are 19 years old, there are times when we are only two in the house and we are the same with each other in the house.
I controlled myself, but he wants, it is not yet ready for him, it is not yet ready for me, because I heard that she had a love before, but I heard that she had a new love, but I heard that she was courting her and she was texting.
I miss him too much but I cannot do anything if he is angry at me, what I just want is for me to be ready for responsibility.
For now, we are still studying.
Brother, is it wrong that I refuse what he wants?
Dear Nilo!
You are a young traitor, because of your principle which is responsible and being responsible for this time, it is rare for you to continue your resolve.
When it comes to your hot relationship with your girlfriend, be careful, you have a big problem that may capture you in a situation that you don't know what may result.
What you did to you is good for what she wants to take away from your life to improve your life in order to improve your relationship because this will strengthen your love and good relationship with each other.
In the moment you get back together, you should avoid the two inside the house and it is better for you to meet in a place where you will not make a thing that might bring you to danger.
"You are the man, you should be the one who cares for his girlfriend for the goodness that you should stand up in telling the" sin and refusal of the world.
Offer your love to God to control your relationship with him in order to make you from temptation.
Do the guidance of this:... that you avoid the bad interests of the youth, you should avoid being honest, honest, loving and with good dealings with others, along with those who call the Lord when there is a clean heart. "(2 cups of vinegar 2: 22).
