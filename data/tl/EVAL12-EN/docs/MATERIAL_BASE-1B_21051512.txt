The SAF 44 was scolded by PNoy.

Instead of nodded and promise that he will do everything to do to get justice for the 44 members of the Philippine National Police-Special Action Force who did not experience justice, maybe it's not only him who lost his life, which is why it's not only him who lost his life, which is why it's not only him, "BS Aquino,", "BS Aquino,"

Hopefully, those who are thinking of being rude and their plans are not enough because even if BS Aquino's case is not enough, it's not enough reason for them to remove or file a case against President Aquino, Bong Revilla and Juan Ponce Enrile, it is possible that it is not the record that it was done by BS Aquino.

Hopefully, being in the desert of the Filipino people is after we found the missing light.
