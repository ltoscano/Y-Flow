Mister Tulfo's PDAF, is just around.

It is obvious that the accusation against one of the known broadcaster and news of TV 5, Erwin Tulfo's involvement with his name at the P10 billion scam, the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF).
In the article of PDI named Nancy Carajal, identified by the two officials of the National Bureau of Business Administration (MTPB), Goma is receiving bribes through the check which costs Php 49,000.
"Written in the articles of Carversus ajal, that bribe is made to be shown on" advertisement, "according to the narration of Rai Hora Mendoza and Vic Cacho, who is former officials of Nabcor.
But according to the lawyer of Tulfo's lawyer, Atty. Nelson Boromeo, if there is a check, it will not be a check but it is not payment for the commercial drivers or services of the Department of Agriculture (DA) or Nabcor when he works at dzCXL.
Tulfo's lawyer also said, before Carl ajal said, before she has received a double check first at dzCXL yesterday, he took the side of Tulfo's side before he published the newspaper.
According to us, Erwin, my suggestions is that before he wrote the malicious accusation against Tulfo, he was able to find out the true story against Tulfo, it was not just a police blotter because it was not just a police blotter because this accusation is severe for Tulfo!
