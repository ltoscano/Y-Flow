Who is Algieri?

Press row of Nelson Beltran (Pilipino Star Ngayon), Nunber 1255; UPP-July 20, 2014 - 12: 00am.

The next fight of Manny Pacquiao is ready.
And this is not against Amir Khan, Danny Garcia, Ruslan Provodnikov, Juan Manuel Marquez or Floyd Mayweather Jr.
Chris Algieri is going to fight against his bet on November 23 in Macau.
Who really is Algieri who seemed to have suddenly appeared and was given a chance to fight Pacquiao.
I do not know Algieri.
American citizen, but has an anti-Tropas.

It was the first time I saw him when he fought against Provodnikov more than a month.
When Algieri had two times in the first round, but he was able to catch up and had a win, he took the WBO junior welterweight title by Provodnikov.
Because of the victory, he suddenly became a candidate for Pacquiao.
Algieri is tall.
And if he has no consideration of Provodnikov, it might be better by Pacquiao.
Algieri is far from Pacquiao's caliber.
It is hard to say if they will be selling the fight against each peso per cent, but this is what they are chosen by Bob Arum for Pacquiao.
Even though it hurts, they took Algieri to crush Pacquiao and achieve the third consecutive wins after two losses.
Pacquiao needs to win the win, especially if it goes out for the result to strengthen the hope that the fight against Mayweather will push through in 2015.
It is difficult to put Pacquiao in an uncertain fight.
That's why it's for sure even if Algieri is chosen.
Except accident.
