Bro, do not imitate us!

Please do not imitate us!

If we are priests, bishops and leaders of the church, you can see that you are arguing and going crazy, please do not imitate us; we don't want us to eat and better to eat in expensive restaurants, forgive us!

If we are priests, bishops and leaders of the church, you can see that you are always hot and not listening to our opinion that we don't imitate us; we don't imitate us; we should not imitate us; we should not imitate us!

If we are priests, bishops and leaders of the church, do not take care of the environment and the environment of God, forgive us... you don't imitate us!
