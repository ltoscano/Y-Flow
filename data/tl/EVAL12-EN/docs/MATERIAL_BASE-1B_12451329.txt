Forcing himself on the housing project is the government By Bernard Taguba (October 28, 2016.
The increase of illegal settlers in the country is not enough because only the Formal sector or those who have regular income will be given priority by the housing projects in the country.
This was admitted by Vice President and Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) Chairperson Leni Robredo in Google interview in General Santos City yesterday.
"The salary that has a salary, has been given salaries and a bit Better" because there is no product that is under the HUDCC to be united, not only the people who have no priority but those who are living in different areas.
The HUDCC does not have a mandate to go back to the house and give funds for the construction of houses but the agencies that are under his office.
According to him, the housing program of the government should not be made to make sure that all the citizens are included, including the Islamic Liberation Front (ISS) to have a decent house.
"What should be signed to everyone, let us think of how we can take the housing program in the town of those who do not have anything, should not be checked by the government there for sectors that have to spend," according to Robredo.
The vice president warned that if it is not changed by the agencies that are under the HUDCC, their system will be easier to rob.
He was ordered to take a glimpse of what he is doing to work, which is part of their development which is supposed to be used for the poor, for those who have the money being sold.
Under the Balance Republic Act, 20 percent in every subdivision, which is being done for the funeral parlor, is supposed to be held for 5 percent in condominium.
