In every crisis, there is a crisis.

To our fellowmen, our corruption is growing every time there is a crisis, like a calamity that was devastated in the Visayas last November, 2013.
What I am referring to is corruption in the disaster that happened and was posted by the typhoon rehabilitation project.
It was reported that it was reported that the piles of house or a small house that was taken away by the government has been removed from the government.
It seems that each of the rooms to live by those affected by typhoon Yolanda are like a pig.
That is not surprising because the administrator of our government and private candidates are corrupt.
Is there even a new there? For each storm that they are receiving billions of pesos, since the time of the Spanish colonizers, Japanese and Americans.
And what is more noticeable is the corruption they are coming from Emilio Aguinaldo, Manuel Quezon, Manuel Roxas, Elpidio Quirino, Garcia, Macapagal, Marcos, Cory, Ramos, Arroyo, Arroyo and Noynoy.
Last Christmas, President Noynoy boasted that the corrupt government have lessened.
On the other hand, it looks like the number of corrupt and those who are not caught or imprisoned are increasing.
The piles of house that was taken away by the government to those who lost their homes in Visayas are not just because it is not just a burden to the New Year, "that is the saying.
Also said by the Department of Public Works and Highways which is famous in corruption, 203 is a temporary house built.
Each of each room has a huge amount of 8.64 square meters that is for each family.
Of course, Noynoy will refuse this allegation, he is impressed by his personnel.
No one is corrupt, and I am not corrupt.
As said by those who do not believe, that's just a ball! "That is just a ball!
