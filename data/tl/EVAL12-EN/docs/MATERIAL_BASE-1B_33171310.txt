Circus in 2005 (Ang very good Samartino), Bago-coloured house in Lipa, we have a relationship in Tagaytay City and I said that I will go straight to Mindoro before and I said I will go straight to it.

But the ship is too slow and it was still traffic at past six o'clock in the evening when I was going up by a jeep going up in Lipa City but I found out that I was going up to the side of the road and I was able to remember that he was working in a casino.

In good news today, Jesus answered who is our fellow.

Jesus said that it is a good Samartino.

He prioritize helping those in need of personal welfare and good fellowmen, it depends on the title.

It is also not connected to being a relative or a member of a group, who are ready to help the people who are ready to help others even if I am not waiting for someone else and if I go there, you might be rich now, okay, okay?
