Protect the funds.
On September 22, 2016, in spite of the suspension of the Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan (MILF) elections, the Commission on Elections (Comelec) will offer 200 million from the six billion pesos.
The P200 million was used to Comelec Spokesman James Jimenez for the ratification of the official for the upcoming election which is set on the next year.
The National Historical Office (NPO) has been printed and according to COMELEC, an estimation of 411 games before it is expected that the Lakas ng mga Bayani has been able to know that because of the slow action or decision during the slow action or decision in the preparation of the barangay and SK elections, it is expected that he would act on the slow action or decision in the preparation of the barangay and SK elections.
Because of the early preparation, the COMELEC has initially spent 200 million particularly on the initial implementation of the ballots that should be used in the election.
That's why we hope that this event would be a lesson in this incident before giving a signal or transaction related to the coming election, wait for the final decision so there will be no waste of funds.
But according to COMELEC, there is still only one left for sufficient funds because it has been reduced to 200 million pesos for the cost of P6B to attract the upcoming election.
It is only him who has to us, not just 200 million pesos because it can't be done for the fulfilment of the duty of Hel body.
Which is why Hel's body needs to do aside from waiting for the final decision on the upcoming elections, make sure that those who have been printed and used to be used in the coming election are intact.
Not only because their fund has sufficient fund, it is just right for the ability to pull the funds in the commission because it is from the treasury of the country.
