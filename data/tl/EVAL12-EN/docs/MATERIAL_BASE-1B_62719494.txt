It's the attitude of PNoy that it comes to 0.5 reward (COP-Tropas.

Because of the report that President Benigno Aquino III will take out of a press conference in Tacloban, many have been used on the rough attitude of the highest official of the country.
According to the bark of our neighbor, President Noynoy should have shown a calm and long time for President Noynoy because the welfare of the damaged citizens are at stake, and not his own coercion.
According to him, it should be explained well and the President supposedly explained what should be done for the rise of Tacloban from the recovery of Tacloban from the Libingan ng "Yolanda" but it seems that this is the opposite of what President Aquino has shown.
Why in his own town, he made the mind to be narrow-minded while when he was disrespected by Hong Kong for the arrival of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Agreement on Indonesia last month, he was just forced by the president?
Does he show that he has a bonfire in the Philippines and he can do whatever he wants?
