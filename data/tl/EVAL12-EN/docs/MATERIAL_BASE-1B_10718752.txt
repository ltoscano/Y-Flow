In elementary school, teachers are pointing at the importance of the flag of the Philippines and the guidance of society, the Constitution or the Saligang Batas to college and the education is over, respect, love and care of the flag together with defending the Constitution.

The challenge to the reaction of Benigno Aquino III recently against the decision of the Supreme Court to illegal the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) that has created it through pork barrel teacher Butch Abad is wrong.

Soldiers and police, to whom are you?
You will decide!
One more thing, when Noynoy will learn to respect our flag, he is the only president who does not put the flag (Commission on Elections) even when he went to another country, is he a Filipino or leader of the Liberal Party?
