Anti-Kidnapping Group, Bernard Taguba, July 21, 2016 Mas cruel punishment are waiting for the thieves after the new Anti-Carnapping Law so as early as now Senator Grace Poe has already warned them to stop their Criminal Court.
Poe made the statement after the new Anti-Carnapping Law even though former President Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino III did not signed, before he went down from his position.
"The New administration bars of the legislative chamber that was hit by the legislative chamber that was sentenced to jail by President Benigno Aquino III for the said law, which was held up by President Benigno Aquino III for the said law, will not be allowed to post bail from the said law, they will not be allowed to post bail from the said law, they will not be allowed to post bail from the said law, and from the said law, they will not be allowed to post bail from the said law.
It can be recalled that up to 40 years imprisonment when the car thieves use violence and if they were killed by them or they raped the owner of the vehicle, their punishment cannot be approved.
