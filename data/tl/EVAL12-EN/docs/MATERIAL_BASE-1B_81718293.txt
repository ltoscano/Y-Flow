Paulo is only four years old.
He / she was able to leave a guitar-shaped forest so I will get the earnings of the father, whose father will earn more; he is not often seen busy with Paulo now in Palawan.
It is a strong interest in music.
Paolo's mother, Olive in a big part of the youth, is to be with something like that, it seems that they are going to be a ground that is why they are going to a ground that is why we are going to go to the church because it is more than six o'clock in the bed.
Two!
It was said that he was really left alone.
Lima was the forest of Paolo which is the first one of those who take care of each other so that someone would return to something like that.
Amazing.
That's why I don't know just a store store so that the four people are really fed up for almost 2,000 pesos.

A dream there in Olive in the face of the band but not the beauty of his voice, that is why he also does not know how to say something.
I saw that he has the abilities to Tom-Tom in the forest so she also has a voice that is why I told her that I already want to be with the one who joined the band wherein I just want to continue the dream of those who have been cut off.
It's because the interests of music are not for Filipinos.
But it is said that when it comes to a different discussion with music, it is part of her daily life for music, Cavite Chik of the shark which is one of our personality, which is why we cannot find out that all the Philippines are fond of the Rock.
It's a bad for him to get married to fall for the talent of the child that they have put it in a Wac Uy, Ortigas, where we are.

When he was able to open it.
There were almost 50 students who were included in the lesson going to the forest.
Surely, we are sure.
The program that Paolo is working in is five pesos.
