Ever since the Holy Week will never forget the most important person in our life, to all people who stated that it was given more than a person, and even in the future, and even in the future, and even in the future, and even in the future, they are going to do anything for your own welfare and future: Your mother.

He is the best, best, and most dependable for all, who have the whole heart to take care of and to take care of it for you; the absence of love given to him by a regular mother to his child.

Where are we now, if we do not have a mother, from the womb, in the care of our bodies, to the care of our bodies, up to our ability and potential, to be good, loving, and serve our fellowmen.

Whatever we have is from him, and if there are changes that happened in our lives for now, we are the ones who will replace you, but if we do not know how to look back where they are doing, they will not give importance to their destination; but if you do not know how to look back where they came from, in the future, they are the ones who have the power and budget if you are taking advantage of it or put in the orphanage.

And whatever our actions are made into a father, and what is what we can harvest, we will also reap goodness because such a good news, the love will be given to another love.

To you, my beloved mother, a few drops of tears are because of my sadness when I think about what you have done in my life, my Mother.

You love, love is expensive, and you will still love him!

Long live our Great God for you.

I love my mother!

Still me.

You love the person you love.
