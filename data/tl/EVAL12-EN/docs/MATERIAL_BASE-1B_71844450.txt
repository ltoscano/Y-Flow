My King.

My King (chief of Christ the King) there is a story about a young man who was given to him by a young man, "said the young man asked him to go home," the young man told me that she was going to fight back to his brother, "the young man told me that she was going to fight back to his brother," the young man told me that she was going to fight back to his brother, "the young man told me that she was going to fight back to his brother," the young man told me that she was going to fight back to his brother. "
And on this rise, nothing will be left behind and you can hope that many will help him through fighting for people whose lives are like what he came from.

And have mercy on us and have mercy on us, give us a heart to give us myself for some of them stumbled and hardworking.
