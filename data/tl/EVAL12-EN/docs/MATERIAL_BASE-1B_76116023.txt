Impending danger.

Some events in different parts of the world are the right thing to focus on and prepare for our government but also for ordinary citizens like us.
I do not want to be a mist but it is noticeable that the prevailing tension between many countries is noticeable.
In the Middle East, the fight of Israel and Lebanon and other countries connected to the said region will have been severe due to the tension between US and other southwest monsoon against Russia because of it being taken away by the Crimea peninsula from the country Ukraine.
After this, it can be provided to the Crimea peninsula which has started with the Russian Football Federation in spite of the strict implementation of the western countries and Russia, it is not impossible that it will end up in a bigger battle of diplomacy and fix the armed war.
Our country was also able to enter a serious situation against China because of the disputed territory of Spratings and in the West Philippine Sea, and because it is really true that we will take a disadvantage with the American troops in the country, because it is likely that it will cause an unexpected turmoil.
In the next time, I will discuss a deeper implication and reason of the impending chaos that is placed in an ambiguous problem in the whole world, the world is really small for more than nine billion people without doubt, the chaos happening in different parts of the world.
And if you will not change the view of the leaders of different countries that are involved in the conflict to take the road towards peace and unity, one day, we will wake up to the world the race of the person because of its own sin and doing it.
