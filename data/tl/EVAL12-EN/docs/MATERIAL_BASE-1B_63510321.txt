Power versus ASG, traffic By Aries and Aries, Bernard Taguba-June 16, 2016, the lawmakers of the Minority Floor of the Congress are going to agree with the emergency powers by President-elect Rodrigo Duterte to crush the bandit group Abu Sayyaf.
According to Quezon City Representative Winnie Castelo, a severe solution should also be done in a severe problem.
"Epal."

Drastic, said Castelo, "Buhay Party-list Rep. Lito Atienza should also be ready to support if President Digong is really necessary to exterminate the ASG, according to him, he is still in accordance with the law.
"Yes.
For Ako Bicol Rep. Rodel Batocabe, if President Duterte is asked to ask, he will be assured that it will be a big help to stop the ASG, he himself will support.
"I will move ahead to support this proposal," according to Batocabe.
Congress, lawmakers are divided on the idea given by Duterte to resolve the traffic in Metro Manila because there is favor and some said that it is not necessary.
According to House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. of the QC, this could not give his position until the proposed bill to resolve the problem of traffic in Metro Manila is not yet done.
"

Even former Manila Mayor and now the Buhay Party-list Representative Lito Atienza is cold on this idea because even if Duterte gave additional power, there is also no use if the corruption in the streets will not be paid.
But if the residents of Metro Manila Rep. Ben Evardone will be asked, it is favorable to give Duterte an emergency power to lessen the implementation of projects to lessen the traffic problem.
