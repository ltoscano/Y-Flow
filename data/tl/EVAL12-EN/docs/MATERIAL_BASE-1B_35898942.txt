A movie about the Lord.

I went to the hospital for a few days because of an operation.
That is why almost the whole day I was able to lie on television for almost two days, aside from the news and history, I also felt like the Hollywood film, that was why it was known that two films about the Lord are sent out.
In the same movie, well-known Oscar's actor, Moros, who has the Lord who has a comedy, is like a comedy, but will really be a source of lessons.
In the first film, he works for someone who will complain to him, that is why it is a God for him to tell him that he is a God for a week, but he needs to tell him that he is a partner of the people and he should respect his loved ones.
That's why he needs to respect it and he needs to respect it and tell him that he will not be the Lord to restore the trust and love from God, and he would just like to be an ordinary person.
The next is about a American congressman, the motto of the World pageant, the Lord ordered him and said to her husband, "when she was asked by her husband," when she asked her husband's wealth, he was not given wealth by God if they are not the opportunity to be rich.
If you ask love, what will be given to you is the chance to have a love, "and the flood came true, and it is not because of the broken dams made for the enemy of the housing project.
And because of that, he.
The movie about God has become very lonely and's very beautiful and beautiful but the person can't say that the people are only alone because the Lord is only one and the second is your love for others.
I want to thank all the people that I became aware of the hours of my illness, thank you very much, my whole life has a huge debt of gratitude, prayer, love and care of me.
God bless.
