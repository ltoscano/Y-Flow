You are a liar for a liar.

The liar are scattered all over the Philippines, there are also a boils of ball.
That's why we have made a little ehek in our lives right now.
It would have been okay if those talking in the country are worthless.
But, they are involved in lying and flattery on serious issues.
It is serious especially if the issues of killings in Mamasapano will be serious, Maguindanao and there are still ongoing action by the leaders of the government.
20 senators: PNoy.
For the 24 senators who called to scrutinize and approved the report of the Senate regarding the investigation of Mamasapano, 20 have signed the approved.
"That's the reason why they are looking at what the report is saying that President Benigno Aquino III has a responsibility in the issues being killed by the 44 members of the Special Action Force, 18 members of Moro Islamic Liberation Front, 18 members of Moro Islamic Liberation Front, 18 members of Moro Islamic Liberation Front, 18 members of Moro Islamic Liberation Front, 18 members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, 18 members of Moro Islamic Liberation Front, 18 members of Moro Islamic Liberation Front, 18 members of Moro Islamic Liberation Front, 18 members of Moro Islamic Liberation Front, 18 members of Moro Islamic Liberation Front, 18 members of Moro Islamic Liberation Front, 18 members of Moro Islamic Liberation Front, 18 members of Moro Islamic Liberation Front, 18 members of Moro Islamic Liberation Front
But not a simple responsibility, Bro, and PNoy.
The report said: "One responsible for the senators is the one responsible.
It is a full of end that it means because he is the approved and ordered by the operation, that's why he's also the one who has the biggest responsibility in the success or downfall.
Then, they failed victory, retaliation again, because Marwan was killed.
There is no corruption.
There was no crime done by PNoy, said the checks they are capable of.
There is no report by the Senate in the crime of the beloved President.
But some senators have a word that is why they did not say anything about the actions of PNoy because they will be the one to judge if there will be someone who will be impeached.
And they just entrust the congressmen if they will be impeached, not just like what they did to former Chief Justice Renato Corona.
Here, Bro, the basis of the impeachment.
It is deliberately a violation of the Constitution, setting up or infidelity to the country, bribery, corruption, different kinds of crimes or disrespect to the trust of the public or the people.
The congressmen did not see anything about the basis of the impeachment.
Is we not lying to the congressmen?
A liar.
Just like what we have said at first, Bro, the many liar for the Mamasapano massacre came out.
Not only the police and military but those from the palace and the foreigners.
Those who are taking advantage!
Out of reports, there are Americans who are included in defending Marwan and their spiritual belief as Abdul Basit Usman, the federal Bureau of Investigation said that they do not have any involvement in Oplan Exodus against the said terrorists.
But almost along with the deny of the FBI to the involvement of their involvement, the report that the finger of Marwan was released immediately to the FBI for DNA testing and ex-SAF chief General Getulio Napenas.
When the Senate reported that there are Americans who are included in Oplan Exodus, American Ambassador Philip Goldberg will join again and say that the forces of the Americans have nothing to do with the said operation.
If there is something, it is for the medical evacuation.
Mabuhay po! "Isn't it!
Does this mean, the senators and General Napenas who said there are Americans who are included in the operation?
And General Edam also liar who said that he is blaming one American who ordered him to protect the MNLF?
Liar!
Oh, meow!
After the result of the result of the Board of Inquiry found out of the Payatas tragedy, the child of seven canned goods, someone was shouting and said that PNoy had nothing to do with the incident.
And the truth is, resigned PNP Chief Alan Purisima asked him to be defeated by Napenas.
To be honest, this is what PNoy has said in his will to avoid any responsibility.
But the truth is, in the first three statements of BOI, which was reported by PNoy, it was said that PNoy has a big responsibility because he ignored the command of command.
In the end, PNoy called out General Ben Magalong and said that he was hurt in the report. "Nayes!
Land in.
Now the citizens are already talking.
PNoy was not able to pass as the outrigger of the president and he is not approved by the President.
The citizens do not want the siblings to be a liar and a boball.
Isn't it?
