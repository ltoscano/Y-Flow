"The President," I learned.

All the Vice President of the republic became president of the country, corrupt or not, Vice President Jejomar Binay might be the president of the country even if his opponents are not deserving to be the president of the Philippines.
"That seems like the Destiny's Vice President, becoming president, should not happen, Senator Koko Pimentel, Allan Cayetano, etc.
We watched the past as VP Carlos P. Garcia who might not be relatives of General Carlos Garcia who became president when Pres. Ramon Magsaysay last March 17, 1957.
Diosdado Macapagal, who won the vice president but was not chosen to be a member of the Midnight Cabinet's condition at Macapagal, he applied for a member of the Midnight Cabinet.
The heated issue before, is that he still has an issue until now, the graft case of the corruption in each of them has the accusations of corruption.
Senate President Ferdinand Marcos defeated Macapagal-Arroyo for the issue of the graft case that was elected as vice-President, Fernando Lopez, who was elected by the former Vice President Eugenio Lopez and ABS-CBN, who was appointed by Marcos, Marcos was appointed by Marcos.
When he became president Fidel Ramos, his Midnight Cabinet was chosen by VP Erap Estrada, who later condemned because of the suspicion that Ramos wants to have a term for extension.
That is also what happened when Erap gave Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as the Midnight member, who took advantage of Estrada's will to repeat the case of Binay, many are praying!
