The meantime continue the discipline in the Manila; COMELEC (Commission on Elections).

The program of Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada and Vice Mayor Francisco "Isko Moreno" will be good in implementing traffic rules in their jurisdiction.
Price of passenger buses that are traveling in Manila from nearby cities have started when they were put inside the right place and obedience to the traffic Rules and Regulations (Kamara) to increase the flow of traffic in the city.
This is just a proof that most of our countrymen are really lacking in discipline, which is why the flow of traffic in Manila is congested, not only in Manila but also in the most cities of the National Capital Region which can be implemented by the traffic system.
In the seat of the two officials, it is almost no money from the funds of Manila but because of the strengthening of the project in fixing traffic, somehow a million pesos per month will be seen by the city where the last, October, reached more than 9 million pesos.
One more will be implemented by Isko Moreno in relation to the traffic, when the passenger halted, the driver will surely judge the vehicle and then he will allow the passenger to go down.
Hopefully, the drivers' discipline will continue not only in Manila but also in all parts of Metro Manila to strengthen the flow of vehicles.
