Pope Francis did not disappoint Mindanao.

Somehow, Pope Francis did not disappoint Mindanao because they have talked about it in his speech in Malaca√±ang, in front of President Aquino and to join the guest in the palace.
And even if Mindanao is not included in the Papal 2015 visit here in the Philippines, this is part of his fervent prayer for the country.
"
The Pope also identified the Comprehensive Final Agreement on the Bangsamoro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) that will be the way to the slow tension in some parts of the country.
"
That is why Pope Francis is not only accepted by the acquaintance of Metro Manila and those from Leyte who visited him.

Pope Francis is also heated with the Lumad and the muslims and other parts of Mindanao and even in other religion - there is a sign that Mindanao can be united in one destination.
The Oriental Mindoro is also emphatically denying the arrival of Saint Pope; everybody is doing nothing on television and even in radio for the last events in the visit of Pope Francis.
And hopefully when the Pope comes back to the Philippines, he is going to go here to us in Mindanao.
