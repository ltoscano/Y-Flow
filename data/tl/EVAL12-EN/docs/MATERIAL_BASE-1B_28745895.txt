Financial advice: Make sure that the change is really true, Kuya Rom April 22, 2016.
Dear Kuya Rom, just hide me with the name Patricia, my father died when she was shot by the thieves, who was hit by a car driven by a drunkard and died in the hospital.
I am the youngest and is always nervous and feels nervous, so I learned to smoke from my brain, I learned that I am walking and having sex with a man when I suddenly came from me inside a van.
I want to regret it, is it wrong for you to be happy now, because I am already dead, why did I want to change for my child, I hope you can help me, brother, thank you very much.
Dear Patricia,
The simultaneous fire in life and search for answers to the questions that he does not make a stand, is easier to weaken and be protected.
What happened to you is for you to be affected by the consecutive typhoons and you cannot think why it has happened to you and you do not know what to do.
Life became too much difficult for you and hoping that you can find a bad effect and it is not good for you to find a bad effect and it is not possible that you can help you because you are wrong in using drugs, and you are regret now.
Do what you want to change.
You will control your whole life to Lord Jesu-Cristo and you will only find the real change and life that will be enjoyable.
According to the Bible, "any new creature in Cristo is already a new creature but he is changed by all of your former personality; he has changed all of this in spite of the challenges that is caused by the sin which is caused by the sin" (Hebrethren or 11: 25).
True change is the evidence that you are in God and are ready for any time to face him, the real change that you have to face him, the real change that you have, will serve as inspiration and strength to your mother.
