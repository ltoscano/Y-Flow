Best guidance.
This is the good manners of being a good citizen of the Philippines.
As a real Filipino, any field or industry is what you earn.
And wherever you are in the world, you are there which is why you need to use one.
An official of our country.
Everything you think is, words, and actions being made.
What you make your true Filipino be a representative of you.
Our countrymen are the fulfilment of their goals in life and whatever.
Events, or what your goal is, may it lead to it.
Happiness or grief, win or jump, success or tragedy, be peaceful.
Unreasonable, --- all of us are directly involved and the following.
Generation, you will be directly hit or let each other be in the hands of each other.
For us it will cause the peace and progress of our country.
This can do for us but the citizens of our country.
You are not ordinary and no one is like you.
As harisees and tribute to your source of brown race.
Which is taxed by a lot of our ancestors, who were fighting against them.
A foreigner and a clad of Filipinos, to have a free Philippines.
It is our right and duty to be proud of all of us.
There is love and concern for our beloved Philippines; Ang Persist.
Perfect.
All of us unite, and happiness or tragedy of each of us are our feelings, but this will be the worry that will continue to wake up our awareness, because it is our natural trait.

Long live the real Filipinos!
