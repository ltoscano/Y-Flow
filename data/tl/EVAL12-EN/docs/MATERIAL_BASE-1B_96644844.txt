Hayan 202.

Traffic is a big issue for the past few days because of the argument of government agencies who are tasked to fix the situation in our roads, it became controversial to teach the blame instead of the actual action to fix the problem.
The more cruel father, sometimes, for people like me, who is almost blamed for the cause of the problem because they do not know what they are doing.
I am a lawyer and I understand the heart of the law, and I know once the hands of our public funds were tied up, and that is not just for the LTFRB which is the only reason of heavy traffic problem.
Traffic is already a lot of problems and not only the LTFRB is the reason for all the problems, but it is also not good to listen to just like washing their hands.
That's why there is a concrete solution for first to visit the executive order that formed the LTFRB.
The intention of the LTFRB to be strong during the time of former President Corazon Aquino is very good, the mother of the democracy of the country is signed by President Cory and the primary goal of the Filipinos of a world-Class Land Transportation Office to raise the condition of traffic in the country.
Now, more than two decades have passed and the traffic problem in the country has not yet been fixed, what is wrong? What did they do?
Others said, that it can be the pork barrel of President Aquino to fix the traffic in main roads in the country, but for this, the old order should be looked at and see where there is a shortcoming.
Like the EO that formed the LTFRB and even in the Administrative Code of 1987 where there are many provisions in the 27th 202, together with a lot and hung.
It is not impossible for fixing this problem, but it should be started to repair the tree and the root, and that is fixing the order given to the agencies like the LTFRB. Sibol, Attorney Ariel Enrile.
