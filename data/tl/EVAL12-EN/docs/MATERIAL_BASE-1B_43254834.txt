First!

Our country is celebrating, especially the world of Filipino sports.
For the very first time, we will get the gold in the Youth Olympics games, which was held in Nanjing in China.
Brought by the flag of the Philippines, the whole Filipino Archer, Gabriel Moreno, was won at the game of Nanjing, with the help of the Chinese national in the gathering of a Chinese national in the sports team held in sports.
The ability of our Filipinos are invaluable, in the field of Relaels.
Even my child is interested in this sports and also undergo serious amount.
Even back then, I have a high hope for those who are such as Archer, billiards and Beach Volunteers Organization for Filipinos.
Because like boxing, here in this field, it is possible that the competing at the International Space.
And here in this point, we hope that we have a big hope for gold medal.
One more thing.
Isn't it right that just when the two young Filipino players, a 14-year-old Balara, a 14-year-old old, who shows a unique form of sports, but what's sad is that they chose their support there instead of her own town.
Even back then, I insisted that our government should focus on the reasons why we have more hope to get gold.
It was a big inspiration brought by the child Gabe Moreno.
Because of his goal of Nanjing, the hope of our pambansang kamao, which can enter the competition in the International Space Station, has increased.
They really need support, from the government and private sector.
And the attention received by Gabe Moreno is now because of his gold medal, which is first first for the Philippines, to be a promotion on this sports.
Congratulations, Gabriel Moreno, thank you for what you shown.
Hopefully this is just first and there are still a lot of gold that came in Sibol, Atty. Ariel Enrile.
