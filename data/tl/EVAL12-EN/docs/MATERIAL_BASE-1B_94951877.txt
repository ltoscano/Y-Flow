I said that you have seen all sorts of things that are really different; we are the ones who are like that, who are the nephews of the niece who are in the hospital.
What are the pitiful ones, who are tired, whose belongings are extremely tired.
The beauty of a teenage boy is beautiful.
But it's just me, do you understand the egg that you are not very lonely and I am not able to do anything yet.
