Bianca and Miguel personally spoke.
Bira Barazeda July 2, 2016.
Because there is no television series now that Miguel Potol and Bianca Umali says that they have more time to be together in personal level.
The two admitted that their family is taking care of each other and they often go out together with their own families.
If the group is talking to each other, we do not know if it is frequent since school starts, and aside from that, there is a regular taping of Ismol Family that can be watched every Sunday night.
That is why the two are still busy.

Hopefully they will be given a new project for them to always be given a new project.
