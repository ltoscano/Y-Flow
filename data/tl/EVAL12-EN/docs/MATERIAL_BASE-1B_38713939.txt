I do not allow Vice President Jojo Binay to erase the accusations being thrown at him, but the administration should have a direct decision in investigating all the thieves in the government, yes, opposition or allies.
Justice Secretary Leila de Lima said that Binay is right that everything will happen to the vice president because of politics.
But de Lima stressed that the allegation against Binay is merits, that he should answer it, but despite the number of cases filed, particularly on the said pork barrel scam, some of the allies of the administration are charged?
All the cases being filed in politics are currently being faced with the case, including three senators, Juan Ponce Enrile, Jinggoy Estrada and Bong Revilla, on the side of the people from the administration, nothing!
It probably cannot be said by the administration that all his allies does not mean that he is faultless, from the issue about fake sympathy that Janet Lim Napoles said.
Recently, de Lima announced that the next carch of officials involved in the scam will be charged but until now, nothing has happened yet.

But if we look at the case of Binay, it seems that its progress is fast, however, it's as if there is a 14 people said to have been released by Binay in his very big wealth.
Binay is challenging all this accusation but I believe that he should show the evidence that he is clean and open his bank accounts.
Somehow the approval of Binay becomes bigger with the approval of Binay, it is true or not, that's why he will take an evidence exposed to him.
In the eyes of the people, it can be seen by the administration and this is not a good impression that we should straighten out for the right path.
That is probably the reason why Senator Grace Poe is growing because he is faultless people like other candidates for the 2016 presidential elections.
