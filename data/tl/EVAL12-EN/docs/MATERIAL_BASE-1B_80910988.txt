The Armed Forces of the Mindanao Command (Eesmincom) Foundry by Captain Alberto Caber asked from those from media if it is true that President Aquino called Mayor Rodrigo Duterte about the terrorist threat that is impending in Davao City.
Caber was asking why it was only Duterte who called President Aquino and they were at the Eesebel, even other military units, they did not call about it.
Caber asked, if it is true that he has a threat, duh!
So, who now is the media and who now is the military and asking one spokesman of a major command like the Eesmincom.
It's because everything started when President Aquino called Duterte last week about a vehicle which was put in a bomb going to the direction of Davao City.
And because Duterte knows the peace and security in the city of Davao, he immediately called the command conference with all military, police and intelligence units in the city to discuss the message of President Aquino.
For Duterte, it is better to be ready instead of becoming pitiful for the city because he is not yet ready, so said development will also be said in the media.
Now, here is the thing, here, President admitted that he called Duterte and the said intelligence report is said to be said. "
There, Captain Caber, President Aquino answered your question if it is true that he called Duterte.
I hope that what we are from the media will ask you and you will not ask if it is true or not.
Because, it means that only one meaning is, if you do not do your job with the Eesmincom, there is a need for the President to know the first one who knows the INTEL.
