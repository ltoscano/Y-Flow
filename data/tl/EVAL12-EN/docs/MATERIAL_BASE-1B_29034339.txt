Jen, in adapting to the family of Dennis!
By Ruel Mendoza June 27, 2016 Representative Dennis Trillo and Jennylyn Mercado said that they are not separated from her Instagram, Jennylyn, together with Dennis and his family in a restaurant.
It was the birthday of Dennis's mother, Missus.

Rita Chapter, Pressure, in that occasion, was the father and a few members of Ho Family.
The proof is that it is not true that the two got separated again because if they would be able to replace the family of Dennis, she started to breakup with Dennis's family when she was involved in the issue with Dennis Padilla as a TV series, Juan, happy, Kim Domingo.

Jen tried to make the scenes of Dennis along with Kim in their television series.
But Dennis denied this and she was shy with Kim because she was even involved in a malicious news.
