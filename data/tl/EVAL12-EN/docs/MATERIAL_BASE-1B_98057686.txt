The lack of work is the lack of livelihood.

The Department of Labor Law Employment Opportunity (DOTC) said that last week, the news has become good but if many have no work in the country, it seems that many jobs in the country have become good but if the survey has been done on the fourth period of 2013, it has been added that every month has passed since it has been added.
If the jobs in 2014 increased, it is still not enough because many people graduated from college.
Just an example is those who graduated from nursing, thousands have ended and can be able to go back to the board exam but even in other countries, it is still no place for nursing and the people who graduated from their house and depend on their parents.
There is a lack of income in the country that is why many are going to the Middle East to take a way so that there will be a source of income than to die from hunger from the Philippines since then, the government has no solution to give a job to the people.
But if the government will only focus on attention from the agricultural sector, this can create a lot of income, support and good governance, there will be a lot of source of income, and for sure, the citizens will be happy and will be happy in this country.
