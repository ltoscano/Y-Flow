Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos Jr. kung ang pagbabasehan ay ang balak nitong pagpoprotesta sa pagkatalo kay Vice President-elect Leni Robredo at sa kabilang banda ay ang pagiging bukas na tumanggap ng cabinet post sa ilalim ng Duterte administration.
Sa opinyon ni Atty. Romulo Macalintal, abogado ni Robredo, kung susunggaban ni Marcos ang cabinet post matapos ang one-year ban ay ituturing na itong pag-amin ng pagkatalo sa nakaraang halalan.
“The one-year ban applies only to election losers. Thus, for Marcos to wait for it is an acknowledgment of having lost in the 2016 election for vice president,” ayon kay Macalintal.
Sinabi pa ng beteranong election lawyer na kung buo ang desisyon ni Marcos na ipursige ang election protest laban kay Robredo, hindi dapat ito tatanggap ng Cabinet post dahil political suicide ito.
“If Marcos believes he has strong evidence to prove that he was ‘cheated’ in said election, then he should just concentrate on his election protest and should never seek a position lower than the vice-presidency.
And to accept a cabinet position while his election protest is pending will mean political suicide for Marcos,” anang beteranong election lawyer.
Kung mangyayari umano ang pagtanggap ng cabinet post ay matatapon lang ang P100 milyon na gagastusin ni Marcos sa election protest.
“He would spend close to P100 million for his protest, which will eventually be dismissed since the consequence of accepting said cabinet post is abandonment and withdrawal of his election protest for VP post,” paliwanag ni Macalintal.
Noong 1998 presidential elections, naghain ng election protest si Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago laban kay dating Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos na nanalo sa nasabing halalan.
Subalit nang tumakbo sa 2001 senatorial elections si Santiago, ibinasura ng Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET) ang kanyang protesta dahil sa “moot and academic” na ito nang tumakbo siya sa halalan at nanalo.

“To reiterate, Marcos’ election protest will also be rendered moot and academic because, like in Santiago, Marcos’ protest is deemed abandoned and withdrawn as a consequence of his appointment and assumption of office and his discharge of the duties and functions of said cabinet position,” punto ng abogado ni Robredo.
