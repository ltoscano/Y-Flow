Anunsyo sa OFWs: Mag-BM online system By Noel Abuel June 14, 2016 Nagpaalala ang Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) sa lahat ng mga papauwing overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) na gamitin ang online system ng Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA).
Sa inilabas na abiso ni Labor Sec.

Rosalinda Dimapilis-Baldoz, ipinaalala nito ang POEA advisory para sa mga balik-manggagawa (BM) o mga nagbabakasyong OFWs na gumamit ng BM online system upang makakuha ng kanilang overseas employment certificates (OEC).
“The goal of the BM Online Processing System is to expedite the issuance of OECs to vacationing OFWs who will return to their respective foreign employers or principals. As a web-based facility, the system enables BMs or vacationing OFWs to apply online for overseas employment certificates and conveniently print the approved OEC anywhere, anytime,” paliwanag pa ng kalihim.
