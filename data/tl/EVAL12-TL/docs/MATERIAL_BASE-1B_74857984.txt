Kristen Stewart at GF na si Alicia Cargile, lantaran na ang relasyon!
By Ruel Mendoza July 29, 2016
Hindi na itinatago ng Hollywood actress na si Kristen Stewart ang kanyang pagiging bisexual at inamin niyang dine-date niya ngayon o dyowa na niya ngayon ang isang babae na nagngangalang Alicia Cargile.
Sa isang interview kay Kristen sa Elle U.K. magazine, nag-open up na ito sa kanyang girlfriend na si Alicia.
“Right now I’m just really in love with my girlfriend.

“We’ve broken up a couple of times and gotten back together, and this time I was like, ‘Finally, I can feel again.”
Ilang beses nang nakukunan ng paparazzi na kasama ni Kristen ang isang babae, pero wala raw silang alam na ito na ang karelasyon niya. Na-link romantically kasi si Kristen sa leading man nito sa Twilight series na si Robert Pattinson at nag-live in pa sila ng ilang taon.
Nakiapid din si Kristen sa director niya na may-asawa sa Snow White and the Huntsman. Kaya malaking rebelasyon na bisexual pala ito. Mas masaya na raw ito sa piling ng isang babae.
“When I was dating a guy I was hiding everything that I did because everything personal felt like it was immediately trivialized, so I didn’t like it.
“We were turned into these characters and placed into this ridiculous comic book, and I was like, ‘That’s mine. You’re making my relationship something that it’s not.’ I didn’t like that.
“But then it changed when I started dating a girl. I was like, ‘Actually, to hide this provides the implication that I’m not down with it or I’m ashamed of it, so I had to alter how I approached being in public. It opened my life up and I’m so much happier.
”Gusto na raw ni Kristen ang karelasyon niya ngayon at hindi siya nahihiyang isapubliko na ito.

“As much as I want to protect myself, it’s not about hiding. As soon as you start throwing up so many walls, you cannot see over them yourself, so you just start isolating in a way that’s not honest.
“I definitely found where I’m comfortable. I don’t take credit for that.”
