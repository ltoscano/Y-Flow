KERR, CURRY MULTADO!
June 19, 2016
OAKLAND, California — Inihayag ng NBA kahapon (Manila time) na sina Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr at NBA MVP Stephen Curry ay pinagmulta ng tig-US$25,000.
Multado si Curry nang itapon ang kanyang mouthpiece matapos siyang tawagan ng ikaanim at huling foul, apat at kalahating minuto pa ra sa fourth quarter ng Game Six.
Habang si coach Kerr nama’y pinagmulta bunga ng pagbatikos sa officials kasunod ng 115-101 loss sa kamay ng Cleveland Cavaliers. Hindi napigilan ni Curry ang emosyon sa pagpito sa kanya ng reperi na nangahulugan na graduate na siya sa laro, kaya’t naihagis ang mouthpiece na tumama sa isang fan.
“Yeah, I’ve thrown my mouthpiece before. I usually aim at the scorer’s table,” komento ni Curry matapos ang laro. “I was off-aim.”
At nang kumalma ay agad namang nilapitan ni Curry ang fan, na nakilalang si Andrew Forbes, anak ng Cavs minority owner na si Nate Forbes at nag-apologized bago tuluyang lumabas ng court papuntang locker room.
“I definitely didn’t mean to throw it at a fan, but it happened,” aniya pa. “I went over and apologized to him because that’s obviously not where I was trying to take my frustration out.
But the last two fouls I had I thought were I didn’t think I fouled either Kyrie [Irving] or LeBron. That’s just kind of my perception of the plays and I had a reaction to it.”
Ipinatanggol rin ni Kerr ang kanyang player at tinuligsa ang officiating.
“He had every right to be upset,” wika ni Kerr. “You know, he’s the MVP of the league. He gets six fouls called on him, three of them were absolutely ridiculous. You know, he steals the ball from Kyrie [Irving] clean at one point.

LeBron flops on the last one, [referee] Jason Phillips falls for that, for a flop. That’s the MVP of the league we’re talking about, these touch fouls in the NBA Finals.”
“Let me be clear: we did not lose because of the officiating,” dagdag pa niya. “They totally outplayed us, and Cleveland deserved to win.
But those three three of the six fouls were incredibly inappropriate calls for anybody, much less the MPV of the league.”
