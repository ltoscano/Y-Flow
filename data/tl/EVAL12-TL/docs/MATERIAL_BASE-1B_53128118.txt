I KNOW BETTER: Maine, nari-relax dahil kay Alden!
Maine, mahirap ka-work!
By Jun Nardo July 4, 2016 Kay Direk Mike naatang ang malaking responsibilidad sa launching ng AlDub loveteam sa big screen. Siyempre, mas mahabaang sabak sa pag-arte ng ginawa rito ni Maine kumpara kay Alde na sanay na sa aktingan.
“Naku, ang hirap ka-work (ni Maine)! ‘Yan ang inside joke namin.

Hashtag #hirap ka work,” biro ng director.
“Hindi. Actually, sa opposite. Ang dali-dali nilang katrabaho. They come with their own challenges, eh. “First challenge on working with AlDub is the security and confidentiality. Nagpunta kami sa Italy, not just Italy but Northern Italy. Sabi ko, at least dito, hindi tayo mamumrublema sa security. We’re keeping things confidential.
“Sa araw-araw na shoot namin sa Italy, ang daming sumusunod na fans. There was one group of fans, they were very proud in every set of location, napuntahan nila habang nagsu-shoot kami. Sinusundan nila.
“Sabi nga ng Italian counterparts namin, they have never seen that. They have worked with George Clooney and Brad Pitt for Ocean’s Twelve. They had done also, worked with all these Hollywood stars, Johnny Depp, they have never seen that. ‘Yung merong sumusunod talaga na tropa, mga fan.
“They were very nice. Sometimes they would bring us Pinoy food.
“The second challenge is iba sila ng experience level. So sinabi ko agad kay Alden na from the very beginning, the moment I handed them the script, sinabi ko kay Alden, nasa ‘yo ang mas mataas na degree of difficulty.
“Kumbaga, parang sa Olympics. ‘Sa‘yo ang mas mahirap na maneuver because more is expected of you because of your acting skills. You’ve been doing this longer than me.’
“For Maine, it’s just to relax. Kasi she’s always nervous. She’s always hard in herself. Ang taas ng standards (niya).

Perfectionist siya in a way. Honestly, hindi sa sinu-showbiz ko kayo.

“If there is one person who could make her comfortable, who can make her relax pag ninenerbyos siya, and that is Alden,” paliwanag ni direk Mike.
“They really have an effect on each other,” diin pa ng director.
