WARRIORS AYAW MAG-GAME 7
By AFP June 17, 2016 LeBron James at Stephen Curry CLEVELAND — “We have a chance to win a championship, so definitely (my) biggest game and I’m ready for it.
”Komento ito ni NBA Most Valuable Player at scoring champion Curry isang araw bago ang Game 6 ngayong umaga sa Quicken Loans Arena (Manila time), na ang pakay ng defending champions ay tapusin na ang serye.
Abante pa ang Golden State Warriors, 3-2, sa best-of-seven championship series. Sa Game 5 noong Lunes sa Oakland, California, nagsanib sina James at Kyrie Irving ng 82 points sa 112-97 win ng Cavaliers at manatiling buhay ang tsansang ma-dethrone ang Warriors.
“For us, it’s just about coming out with that aggressive mindset, pushing in transition and getting easy opportunities,” ani Irving hinggil sa kanyang 41-point output.
Wala pang koponan na nagawang makabalikwas mula sa 3-1 deficit sa NBA Finals at wala pa ring koponan sa 50 taon ng liga na nakapuwersa ng seventh game.
“We have confidence we can win the series,” komento ni Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue. “They have seen the blueprint is just being physical, being aggressive and attacking the basket. You don’t play Golden State, you attack them. So we’ve got to attack.”
Magbabalik sa bench ng Warriors si forward Draymond Green, nasuspinde sa game five sanhi ng naipong playoff flagrant fouls.
Si Green ang Finals MVP noong nakaraang season.
“He’s going to play with that same aggression, same passion, leave it all on the floor but be smart,” ani Curry. “He can do that without having to take away a piece of what he does on the floor.

“He won’t get baited into any kind of altercations. I’m pretty sure he’ll be talkative, but hopefully in a very constructive kind of way.”
“He knows if he gets another flagrant he misses game seven,” warning ni Warriors coach Steve Kerr kay Green. “I’d be shocked if anything happened on that front.”
Gayunpaman, sa pagbabalik ni Green, hindi naman makakalaro si Australian center Andrew Bogut, na magbabakasyon ng anim hanggang walong linggo sanhi ng left knee injury.
