<4>	(18.095-39.390)	alam mo talagang <hes> nakakaiyak at <hes> hanggang sa mga oras na ito nakapag- -- napag-uusapan 'yong kanilang pinagdaanan noon ano bilang <hes> isang pamilya 'no na naghirap talaga lalong-lalo na si Manny na 'no 'yong mga pinaghirapan niya eh talagang sabi niya nga hindi daw talaga maiwasan kung 'di mo talagang 'pag nagbabalik-tanaw talagang maiyak pa rin sila 'no .	you know it really is tearful and until these hours -- talking about what they went through in the past what as one family yes that really suffered specially Manny those that he worked for he really said it cannot really be avoided if you do not really if looking back they really still cry right .
<5>	(39.390-56.954)	pero ang maganda nito 'no doon nila nakikita 'no na talagang kahit na naghirap sila dumaan sila sa hirap ay nakita nila na talagang may pag-asa basta ikaw ay may <hes> sipag tiyaga at 'tsaka siyempre 'yong dedikasyon mo do'n sa binibigay talaga katulad ni Manny do'n sa kaniyang craft ano which is 'yong boxing nga .	but what is good here yes that is where they see that even if they really suffered they went through suffering they saw that there is really hope just as long as you have diligence patience and also of course your dedication there in what is really given like Manny there in his craft what which is that boxing .

<8>	(90.488-104.785)	at ito namang si Bobby hindi niya daw makakalimutan 'yong <hes> mga panahon na 'yong mismong <hes> Kuya Manny niya ang <hes> nag-aalaga rin sa kanila 'no talagang <hes> kung ano 'yong kakainin na lang sana kung baga niya ay ibibigay pa sa kaniya .	and this Bobby here he allegedly cannot forget those times when his brother Manny himself cared also for them what really what it is they should be eating he gives to them instead .
<9>	(104.785-106.619)	gano'n talaga daw mag-alaga itong si Manny .	that is really how Manny cares .
<10>	(106.619-111.201)	kaya kanina hindi mapigilan no'ng <hes> dalawa kung 'di parang <hes> maging teary-eyed ika nga .	so earlier those two cannot hold back if not like becoming teary-eyed as they say .
<11>	(111.201-130.271)	kahit itong si Bobby na talagang machong-macho hindi ba pero talagang <hes> kanina no'ng na-interview natin siya talagang <hes> medyo naluluha-luha ito 'no pero ang <hes> pinakamaganda naman dahil sa nangyaring mga paghihirap ay mas na-a-appreciate nga naman daw nila talaga sa family 'yong <hes> tinatamasa nilang tagumpay lalong-lalo na si Manny ano .	even Bobby here who is really very macho is he not but really earlier when we interviewed him really he is slightly getting teary but the best thing is because of the difficulties that happened their family really appreciated more the success they are enjoying especially Manny what .

<25>	(206.090-209.390)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<26>	(209.390-221.682)	'yan partner ano ang ilang lamang do'n sa mga pahayag ng <hes> pagsariwa no'ng <hes> ng mga kamag-anak nitong si Manny sa kung gaano kabait at <hes> of course na-appreciate nila 'yong tagumpay na tinamasa rin ngayon ni Manny .	that is partner what several only on those statements of refreshing of of the relatives of Manny here on how kind and of course they appreciate the success that Manny is now enjoying .
<27>	(221.682-272.656)	at si Manny mismo ano no'ng nakausap din natin siya <hes> a few days ago sinasabi niya na he's grea- -- very very grateful ano thankful siya doon sa mga blessings at ang dami-dami daw talagang blessings na kaniyang <hes> tinatamasa ngayon at hinding-hindi niya 'yan makakalimutan kaya ang ginagawa niya rin is really mag-share is hindi lamang do'n sa mga pamilya niya 'no na mga kaanak niya kung hindi sa lahat ng pupuwedeng pag-shareran niya ng kaniyang blessings at <hes> ma- -- maiba lang tayo <hes> partner kanina supposedly ay mayro'n pa nga siyang <hes> afternoon gym shession- -- session ano pero <hes> hindi na ito tumuloy ang ating pambansang kamao dahil <hes> pinili na lamang niya na magpahinga dito sa kaniyang bahay at kakagising lamang niya 'no simula kaninang <hes> after lunch no'ng <hes> pagkauwi niya do'n sa kaniyang <hes> training medyo nagkuwentuhan dito sa kaniyang bahay at hindi na nga ito nag- -- <hes> -- nagpasya ito na talagang magpapahinga na lamang dahil may jet lag pa rin ang ating pambansang kamao .	and Manny himself you see when we talked to him a few days ago he is saying that he's grateful -- very very grateful right he is thankful for those blessings and there are really so many blessings that he is receiving now and he will never ever forget so what he is also doing is really to share not only with his family right his relatives but also to all he can share his blessings with and -- to segue partner earlier he supposedly had an afternoon gym session -- session right but our national fist did not push through because he just chose to rest here in his house and he just woke up right a while ago after lunch when he got home from his training there was some sort of conversation here in his house and he has not -- he decided to just really take some rest because our national fist still has jet lag .
<28>	(272.656-285.096)	so sabi niya nga talagang kilala niya kung ano 'yong kailangan ng kaniyang katawan at 'yan ay talagang binibigay niya hanggang <hes> maaari hanggang kaya para rin mapangalagaan of course 'yong kaniyang lakas para naman bukas sa kaniyang training muli ano .	so he really said he knows what his body really needs and he really gives this as much as possible until he can still take care of course his strength so that tomorrow for his training again right .
<29>	(285.096-288.301)	so 'yan muna ang pinakahuli dito naman sa Los Angeles California .	so that's it for now the latest here in Los Angeles California .
<30>	(288.301-289.830)	partner balik muna sa 'yo .	partner back to you .
<31>	(289.830-307.292)	partner siguro diyan papasok ano 'yong mental aspect ng larong boxing kung 'yong sa papa'no huhugutin 'yong <hes> ang mga nakaraan mo <hes> 'yong background no'ng boxing na 'yon na- -- nabanggit ko ito dahil sabi ng ilang analyst eh talagang <hes> makakatulong 'yong five losses nitong si <hes> Manny sa laban nila kay Floyd Mayweather .	partner maybe that's where the mental aspect of the boxing game will enter on how to cull out the your past the background of that boxing I have mentioned this because some analyst said that really those five losses of this Manny can help against their fight with Floyd Mayweather .
<32>	(307.292-312.852)	kasi itong si Mayweather eh hindi madakai- -- hindi pa nakakatikim ng pagkatalo pero itong si Manny ay nakatikim na .	because this Mayweather well has not -- has not tasted defeat yet but this Manny has tasted it already .
<33>	(312.852-315.396)	so kung baga bentahe daw ito para sa kaniya partner .	so as if this is an advantage for him partner .
<34>	(315.396-320.750)	gano'n din ba 'yong naririnig mo diyan sa kampo ni <hes> -- ni Manny <hes> partner ?	is that what you also hear there in the camp of -- Manny partner ?
<35>	(320.750-322.421)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<36>	(322.421-323.310)	definitely .	definitely .
<37>	(323.310-348.462)	sabi nga ni Manny 'no talaga partner na 'yong kaniyang mga pa- -- mga <hes> experiences 'no ng pagkatalo dati alam niya how it's like hindi ba na talaga alam niya namang dapat may ginawa pa siya pero sabi niya nga para naging complacent siya at one point sa kaniyang <hes> career kaya medyo naapektuhan din 'yong kaniyang pagkapanalo so hinding-hindi na niya talaga uulitin sabi niya nga nagtanda siya dahil doon sa mga insidente na 'yon .	as really told by Manny partner that those his -- experiences right of defeat before he knows how it's like isn't it that he really knows that he could have still done something but he said like he's complacent at one point in his career so his win is somewhat affected so he will never ever repeat it he said he learned because of those incidents .
<38>	(348.462-370.180)	at kaya ngayon alam niya kung ano 'yong <hes> pakiramdam na parang mas magpursige pa lalo kung baga alam niya to <hes> really give it all ika nga doon sa pagbibigay naman ng <hes> importansiya doon sa talent na e- -- mayroon siya 'no sa boxing kasi it's one thing partner 'di ba na talagang <hes> nagpupursige ka para maging magaling ka .	and now he knows what is the feeling like to persevere more especially for instance he knows this really give it all as told there in the giving of importance there on the talent -- he has boxing because it's one thing partner right which is really you are persevering for you to become good .
<39>	(370.180-377.820)	and it's another thing na magaling ka na talaga dahil 'yan ay binigay sa iyong talento 'di ba ng Panginoon at <hes> hino-hone mo pa lalo .	and it's another thing that you are really good because that is a talent given to you right by God and you are honing it further .
<40>	(377.820-407.534)	so in Manny's case alam naman natin na talagang mayro'n na siya talagang gift ano dito sa kaniyang <hes> craft or sa kaniyang pinasukan na -- na trabaho ano which is boxing pero ang maganda dito is na-a-appreciate niya alam niya kung papaano 'yan i-appreciate at <hes> papaano pa siya mas lalo pang- -- gagaling sa determinasyon dahil <hes> alam niya na i- -- mayro'n din siyang kung baga taste of <hes> kung baga failure kung baga (()) kung matatawag natin na 'yon ano -- 'yong <hes> pagkatalo rin niya do'n sa mga nakaraang <hes> laban niya .	so in Manny's case we already know that he really has a gift what is this in his craft or in the job he enters in right which is boxing but what is good here is he appreciates he knows how is it appreciated and how will he be able to be more -- better in determination because he knows -- he also has like taste of like failure like (()) if we can call it that right -- his defeat there in his previous fight .
<41>	(407.534-409.057)	so alam niya 'yong pait 'no ?	so he knows the bitterness right ?
<42>	(409.057-430.330)	alam niya 'yong hindi lang kasi siya 'yon nga 'yong sinasabi niya hindi lang siya ang nakakaramdam no'ng sakit kung 'di lahat no'ng mga nakapaligid sa kaniya na umasa na mga Pilipino so ayaw niyang ma-disappoint definitely so ito 'yong nagiging driving force ika nga niya ngayon para lalo pang pag-igihan kasi siya na mismo ang nagsabi partner na i- -- this is the fight of his life .	he knows that it is not only him what he is telling he is not the only one feeling that pain but also all those surrounding him Filipinos who are hoping so he does not want to disappoint definitely so this is becoming the driving force he now said to excel more because he himself has told partner that -- this is the fight of his life .
<43>	(430.330-443.325)	pero partner mayro'n ding isang scenario ang nakikita dito nga sa megafight <hes> pinakamalaking <hes> fight na raw siguro ito <hes> sa boxing pero posible rin itong maging boring daw <hes> partner dahil posibleng tumakbo lang ng tumakbo itong si Mayweather .	but partner there is also one scenario seen here in the megafight maybe this is the largest fight in boxing but possibly this will become boring partner because Mayweather may just possibly run and run .
<44>	(443.325-453.929)	I'm sure pinaghahanda nila ito sa kampo ni <hes> Pacquiao pero to what extent <hes> nila mapipigilan 'yong posibleng pagtakbo nitong si <hes> Mayweather para maiwasan 'yong mga power punches ni <hes> -- ni Manny <hes> partner ?	I'm sure they have been preparing for this in the camp of Pacquiao but to what extent can they stop the possible running of this Mayweather to avoid those power punches by -- by Manny partner ?
<45>	(453.929-456.950)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<46>	(456.950-465.494)	alam mo partner very interesting ano 'yong <hes> nabanggit nitong <hes> dating World Heavyweight Champion na si Mike Tyson sa kaniyang <hes> blog ano ?	you know partner very interesting the the mentioned by this former World Heavyweight Champion Mike Tyson in his blog right ?
<47>	(465.494-480.762)	ang sabi niya do'n sa kaniyang blog na naniniwala siya na mananalo itong si Manny Pacquiao over Mayweather dahil daw hindi ibig sabihin 'di ba na parang <hes> masyadong kalkulado or napag-aaralang scientific 'yong <hes> kung baga istilo nitong si Mayweather ay mananalo na ito .	what he said there in his blog that he believes this Manny Pacquiao will win over Mayweather because it does not right like too much calculated or studied scientifically that like the style of this Mayweather is he will win .
<48>	(480.762-491.398)	dahil <hes> sa mga previous fights daw nitong si <hes> Manny Pacquiao ay ang mga nakakatalo sa kaniya 'no ay 'yong mga sugod ng sugod hindi ba katulad ni Marquez hindi ba ?	because in the previous fights of this Manny Pacquiao those who have defeated him right are those who attack and attack unlike Marquez isn't it ?
<49>	(491.398-515.420)	so iyan 'yong mga parang <hes> talagang kung baga kung baga 'pag may kontrapelo mas nagkakaroon ng <hes> <hes> fight na parang nabibigla itong ating pamban- -- pambansang kamao pero sa kaso nitong si Floyd Mayweather na sinasabi nila na kalkulado na na scientific masyado ang galaw hindi uubra sa katulad ng isang Manny Pacquiao na kahit saang anggulo ay pupuwedeng tumama ang suntok .	so there those that are like really but rather but rather if there is an opponent it has more fight that seems to shock our -- national fist but in this case of Floyd Mayweather who they say has movement that is already calculated very scientifically will not work to the likes of a Manny Pacquiao that even in any angle can hit a punch .
<50>	(515.420-522.236)	so kung magiging boring siguro on the part of Mayweather I don't think gano'n ang mangyayari naman sa parte ng ating pambansang kamao .	so it could be boring on the part of Mayweather I don't think that will happen in the part of our national fist .
<51>	(522.236-529.964)	dahil alam natin talagang itong <hes> ating pambansang kamao kapag nakikita niya talagang hindi siya 'yong nilalapitan siya naman talaga ang susugod 'di ba ?	because we really know that our national fist when he sees he does not really go near he really advances right ?
<52>	(529.964-542.559)	so <hes> I think <hes> 'yan eh of course eh makikita natin talaga sa Mayo a-dos pero definitely nasa ano na rin 'yan eh nasa disposisyon na rin ng dalawang <hes> <hes> fighters natin dahil <hes> pa- -- paka- %incomplete	so I think that well of course well we can really see so May two but definitely it is also in also in disposition of our two fighters because the -- %incomplete
<53>	(542.559-553.358)	ang pakawala nga no'n ng kampo ni Mayweather ay pinaghahandaan din nila at may bago daw na gagawing istilo rin itong si Mayweather kaya siyempre kung may bago parating exciting 'di ba partner ?	the released statement of the camp of Mayweather was that they are also preparing and there is said to be a new style that Mayweather will do so of course if there is something new it is always exciting right partner ?
<54>	(553.358-554.003)	okay .	okay .
<55>	(554.003-555.493)	sana nga magdilang-anghel itong si ~ %incomplete	I hope what he said will come true %incomplete
