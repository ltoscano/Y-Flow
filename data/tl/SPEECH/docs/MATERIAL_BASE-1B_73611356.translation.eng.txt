<45>	(213.610-217.631)	kasi po 'yung karaniwan po na tennis ball medyo mabigat po 'yon .	because the usual tennis ball is slightly heavy .
<46>	(217.631-221.116)	pag hinampas mo ng raketa medyo malayo po ang mararating .	if you smash it with a racket it can go a little bit farther .

<55>	(254.723-266.320)	I think considered as professional tennis players no so pagdating naman sa dagat at gusto nilang mamahinga hindi naman sila puwedeng makapaglaro do'n ng regular tennis na game nila .	I think considered as professional tennis players in terms of the sea and they want to take rest and they cannot play there their regular tennis game .
<56>	(266.320-268.774)	so ito po ang nilalaro nila beach tennis .	so they are playing this beach tennis .

<62>	(283.079-283.431)	okey .	okay .
<63>	(283.431-298.063)	kumbaga kung pustahan lang pero kung talagang tournament po ang pag-uusapan at 'yun po eh gusto ni 'yong gawin like in competition with other group <hes> maganda po mixed doubles and singles puwedeng-puwede po .	like if only for a bet but if we are discussing a real tournament and you want to do that in a competition with other group it is good to have mixed doubles and singles is also possible .
<64>	(298.063-298.780)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<65>	(298.780-305.430)	ang court po niya ay kasing laki po ng <hes> parang volleyball court eight by sixteen .	its court is as big as like a volleyball court eight by sixteen .
<66>	(305.430-309.480)	pagkatapos ang taas po ng net niya ay one point five meter .	and then its net is too high one point five meter .
<67>	(309.480-314.777)	so kung gusto n'yo po ng singles hahatiin lang po 'yun sa gitna tapos puwede po kayong maglaro ng singles .	so if you want singles it will be divided in the middle and then you can play singles .
<68>	(314.777-318.480)	kung doubles naman po 'yung buong court po 'yun ang gagamitin .	for doubles the whole court will be used .
<69>	(318.480-327.330)	uhum and then ang scoring <hes> ano parang ano lang 'to 'yung isang match is good only for <hes> one match -- ah one set ?	uhm and then the scoring like this one match is good only for one match -- ah one set ?
<70>	(327.330-328.127)	ah tama ba ?	ah is it right ?

<72>	(339.997-351.398)	tapos po bawat <hes> first side halimbawa kayo po ang unang tira ng bola <hes> tatlong beses n'yo po -- <hes> tatlong beses po kayong <hes> mag-se-serve ?	then in each first side for example you will be the one who hits the ball first three times -- three times you will serve ?
<73>	(351.398-358.880)	mag- -- mag <hes> hit ng ball kung hindi n'yo po makuha 'yon i-che-change po 'yon do'n sa kabilang ano -- kabilang side .	will -- will hit the ball if you cannot get it it will be changed in the opposite side -- opposite side .
<74>	(358.880-365.892)	hm so kailangan talagang parang sa badminton laging aloft 'yung -- 'yung -- 'yung bola ano ?	hmmm like in badminton it really needs the -- the ball to be always aloft ?
<75>	(365.892-371.032)	at pagka na- -- tumama na sa ground <overlap> dapat po hindi siya malalaglag sa sahig .	and when -- it hits the ground it should not fall down to the floor .
<76>	(371.032-374.644)	kasi pag nalaglag po siya sa sahig <overlap> iskor na po 'nong kabilang side .	because if it slips off to the floor that is the score of the other side .
<77>	(374.644-375.990)	<overlap> yeah right .	yeah right .
<78>	(375.990-378.685)	mukhang mas simple 'yung rules dito 'di ba ?	seems the rules here are simpler right ?
<79>	(378.685-391.596)	<overlap> hindi kumplikado at 'tsaka ang masarap do'n <hes> masaya siyang laruin <overlap> kasi <hes> (()) may itatanong talagang ako po ay isa sa badminton enthusiast .	not complicated and what is good there it is fun to play because (()) I really have a question I am a badminton enthusiast .
<80>	(391.596-399.361)	talagang do'n po ako sumexy <laugh> <overlap> sa paglalaro po ng badminton not so of a tennis player .	I really became sexy there in playing badminton not so of a tennis player .
<81>	(399.361-402.132)	kasi talagang gustong-gusto kong mag-badminton .	because I really want to play badminton .
<82>	(402.132-406.076)	and when I started playing badminton before talagang I lost (()) pounds .	and when I started playing badminton before I really lost (()) pounds .
<83>	(406.076-406.583)	wow .	wow .
<84>	(406.583-409.170)	just by playing badminton in three months .	just by playing badminton in three months .
<85>	(409.170-418.652)	so if you -- if you can just imagine itong beach tennis po na 'to mas <hes> mas ac- -- magiging active po ka po dahil you play it on the sand .	so if you -- if you can just imagine this beach tennis is more -- I become active because you play it on the sand .
<86>	(418.652-424.505)	so talagang good for the health kasi cardiovascular siya na may exercise .	so really good for the health because it has a cardiovascular exercise .
<87>	(424.505-429.926)	<hes> at 'tsaka talagang hindi mo napapansin pinapawisan ka na habang naglalaro .	and you will not really notice you are already sweating while playing .
<88>	(429.926-430.409)	oo .	yes .
<89>	(430.409-436.390)	so <overlap> pati sa tuhod 'di ba okey kasi malambot 'yung sand eh .	so it is fine even on the knees because the sand is soft anyway .
<90>	(436.390-443.289)	<overlap> tumalon ka o malaglag ka <hes> less po ang injuries dito .	jump or fall injuries are less here .
<91>	(443.289-448.977)	hindi po kayo masasaktan kasi siyempre kung ang lalaglagan mo naman eh sand <hes> it's very safe .	you will not get hurt because of course if what you will fall on is sand it is very safe .
<92>	(448.977-453.374)	nakita mo nga parang may ano eh medyo acrobatic 'yung laro eh 'di ba ?	you saw there seemed to be well the game was a bit acrobatic right ?
<93>	(453.374-461.259)	<overlap> parang lilipad ka tatalon ka and then mag-da-dive ka susubsob <overlap> ka sa sand parang ang daming makikita mong aksiyon eh .	like you will fly you will jump and then will dive will fall on your face on the sand like you will see a lot of action .
<94>	(461.259-462.660)	opo .	yes .
<95>	(462.660-482.825)	kaya nga pag halimbawa <hes> sinearch po nila beach tennis talagang mag-e-enjoy sila kasi <hes> it's a fun sport it's a fun game and then <hes> habang nilalaro mo siya <hes> pag natapos mo siyang laruin hahanap hanapin mo kasi nando'n 'yung pagiging active mo lalabas eh .	so for example when they search for a beach tennis they will surely enjoy because it is a fun sport it is a fun game and then while playing it after you finish playing you will yearn for it because it will apparently unleash your activeness .
<96>	(482.825-490.594)	and then if you're a competitive person kung mahilig kang makipag-compete this is also <hes> a great sports play .	and then if you are a competitive person if you like to compete this is also a great sports play .
<97>	(490.594-491.560)	uhum .	hmm .
<98>	(491.560-504.960)	well last Sunday <hes> when you had a clinic and the first beach tennis mini tournament mayroon kayong mga guest na mga players from National University from University of the Philippines from Saint Benilde .	well last Sunday when you had a clinic and the first beach tennis mini tournament you had guests who are players from the National University from University of the Philippines from Saint Benilde .
<99>	(504.960-509.250)	at 'yung mga national players din natin na katulad ni Marian Capadocia .	and those national players too like Marian Capadocia .
<100>	(509.250-517.289)	at karamihan sa kanila first time naglaro parang from lawn tennis they shifted to beach tennis at napakabilis nilang naka-adjust .	and most of them played for the first time like from lawn tennis they shifted to beach tennis and they adjusted quickly .
<101>	(517.289-518.176)	right .	right .
<102>	(518.176-531.727)	<hes> kaya nga po nakakatuwa kasi <hes> mas na-e-encourage 'yung mga talagang athletes natin kagaya nila miss Marian Capadocia <hes> na i-try din siya kasi talagang it's fun .	that's why it's satisfying because our true athletes like Miss Marian Capadocia are encouraged more to try it too because it's really fun .
<103>	(531.727-539.836)	it's a fun game it's a fun sport hindi -- hindi mo kailangan ng maraming parang chechebureche para matuto 'nong game .	it is a fun game it is a fun sport not -- you do not need a lot of triviality to learn the game .
<104>	(539.836-540.260)	oo .	yes .
<105>	(540.260-554.540)	<hes> ang <int> gagawin mo lang eh mayroon kang bola may raketa ka tapos pumunta ka lang do'n tapos maglaro lang kayo pasa-pasa lang ng bola hanggang sa hindi mo alam naglalaro ka na 'nong beach -- 'yun na 'yun that's beach tennis .	what you only need to do is you have a ball you have a racket then you go there and you just play just passing the ball until you no longer know that you are playing at the beach -- that's it that's beach tennis .
<106>	(554.540-560.691)	<overlap> recently nagkaroon ng Asian beach <hes> games 'no sa Thailand 'no ?	recently there was an Asian beach games in Thailand right ?
<107>	(560.691-563.400)	<hes> 'yun bang beach tennis nilaro din don ?	was beach tennis played there too ?
<108>	(563.400-567.510)	<hes> I'm not very sure tito Ron 'no ?	I'm not very sure Tito Ron right ?
<109>	(567.510-574.372)	but <hes> we are pushing <hes> for beach tennis talaga to be known here in the Philippines .	but we really are pushing for beach tennis to be known here in the Philippines .
<110>	(574.372-574.810)	uhum .	yes .
<111>	(574.810-589.136)	and <hes> ang gusto ko talaga ang pangarap ko eh makapagbuo talaga tayo ng grupo that would become professional beach tennis players na <hes> puwedeng ipadala natin abroad to compete internationally .	and what I really want is my dream is for us to form a group that would become professional beach tennis players that we can send abroad to compete internationally .
<112>	(589.136-595.460)	para mayroon naman tayong <hes> nag-re-raise na ng flag ng Philippine beach tennis sa ibang bansa hindi ba ?	so that we can have someone to raise the Philippine flag of beach tennis in other countries am I right ?
<113>	(595.460-599.063)	<overlap> lalo na tayong mga Pilipino we're very competitive .	especially us Filipinos we're very competitive .
<114>	(599.063-599.500)	right .	right .
<115>	(599.500-607.407)	pagkatapos <hes> magagaling talaga tayo so once we set our hearts into something we will always always win .	and then we're really good so once we set our hearts into something we will always win .
<116>	(607.407-619.290)	so naniniwala ako na itong beach tennis pag natutunan 'to ng mga Pilipino at talagang may mga magagaling tayo na makuhang players mananalo tayo abroad instantly wala tayong problema .	that's why I believe that beach tennis if learned by Filipinos and if we get really good players we will win instantly abroad and we won't have a problem .
<117>	(619.290-628.902)	alam mo sa panonood ko 'nong Sunday 'no nakita ko na parang bagay 'tong sport na 'to sa ating mga kababayan eh dahil (()) hindi mo kailangang maging matangkad .	you know in watching last Sunday I can feel that this sport really fits our fellowmen because (()) you don't need to be tall .
<118>	(628.902-633.240)	hindi kailangan ng mamahaling sapatos dahil nakapaa ka lang .	you don't need an expensive shoes because you have to be on your bare feet .
<119>	(633.240-642.210)	at <hes> 'yung gilas ng mga Pilipino talagang bagay dito sa sport na 'to basta mabilis ka at <hes> magaling ka rin mag-placing 'di ba ?	and the energy of the Filipinos really fit this sport as long as you're quick and good at placing right ?
<120>	(642.210-645.749)	tama at 'tsaka tayo po kasi tayo mga maliliksi tayo eh .	right also because we're sharp .

<122>	(648.569-649.460)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<123>	(649.460-655.290)	so kagaya ng halimbawa ng basketball hindi ka naman maiisahan ng ng -- ng bola 'di ba ?	that's why for example in basketball you won't be outweighed by the -- the ball right ?
<124>	(655.290-661.330)	so kailangan parang gano'n din beach tennis kailangan talagang concentrated ka lang nakatutok ka .	it's necessary that you're also like that in beach tennis you need to concentrate and stay focused .
<125>	(661.330-669.634)	<hes> napaka- -- positive ng larong ito kaya kahit sino madaling matuto nito at talagang magugustuhan nila 'tong larong 'to .	-- positive anyone can easily learn this and they will really like this game .
