<2>	(4.096-13.790)	<sta> sa puntong ito balikan po muna natin ang tungkol s desisyon ng FIBA central <sta> board na China ang magiging host nation para sa twenty nineteen FIBA World Cup .	at this point let us go back first to the discussion about the decision of the FIBA central board that China will be the host nation for the twenty nineteen FIBA World Cup .
<3>	(13.790-18.001)	<sta> makakausap po natin mula sa Tokyo Japan si Chiqui Roa-Puno .	we will talk to Chiqui Roa-Puno from Tokyo Japan .
<4>	(18.001-25.310)	<sta> Chiqui anong masasabi mong pangunahing dahilan ng pagkatalo ng Pilipinas <sta> laban sa China para sa hosting rights ng FIBA ?	Chiqui what can you identify as the main reason for the Philippines' loss against China for the hosting rights of FIBA ?
<5>	(25.310-27.513)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<6>	(27.513-42.520)	<sta> well I thing ito sa case Lucie of <hes> 'yung ito talagang ipinagmalaki at ipinagyabang ng China na kanilang <hes> experience at saka 'yung kanilang know-how kung papaano nga mag-a -- magpalabas ng ganitong kasing kalalaking mga international events .	well I thing this is a case Lucie of what China is really proud of and is boasting about is their experience and their know-how on how to really -- to release these large international events .
<7>	(42.520-59.591)	eh talagang tumatak na rin <sta> siguro sa FIBA at <hes> inulit ulit nila that they were promising more for this coming FIBA twenty nineteen <sta> at <hes> talagang they stressed the fact na hindi sila umaatras sa kanilang mga <hes> mga promises ano sa kanilang mga <sta> <hes> mga ipinapangako .	so maybe it really made an impression on FIBA and they repeatedly said that they were promising more for this coming FIBA twenty nineteen and they really stressed the fact that they never go back on their promises on their promises .
<8>	(59.591-70.480)	<sta> isa siguro 'yun at <hes> siguro madali din kasi sa ating madala sa ating pagiging <hes> <sta> madamdamin at emosyonal dahil nga nakikita natin ang ating mga kababayan .	that's probably one thing and maybe it is also because it is easy for us to be dramatic and emotional since we are seeing our fellow countrymen .
<9>	(70.480-77.899)	pero kailangan nating alalahanin na ang kausap natin ay hindi lahat Pilipino at marami rin silang ibang mga bagay na <hes> kinokonsidera .	but we need to remember that those we are speaking to are not all Filipinos and they are also considering many other things .

<11>	(83.719-101.701)	alam mo Quinito pinag-uusapan natin na tinatanong ni Lucie kung sa tingin mo ano ang naging <hes> parang pinaka- -- <hes> factor na -- na talagang nag <hes> nag <hes> desisyon or <hes> biniga -- <hes> pinag-isipan ng <hes> twenty six man panel at kung bakit unang-una napakatagal nila bago magbigay ng desisyon ?	you know Quinito we are talking about Lucie is asking if you think what has been like the most -- factor that -- that really has has decided or -- thought about it twenty-six man panel and first and foremost why it takes them so long to make a decision ?
<12>	(101.701-105.740)	well Chiqui <hes> Lucie ano sa tingin -- sa tingin ko hindi pa panahon natin .	well Chiqui Lucie what I think -- I think it is not yet our time .
<13>	(105.740-110.800)	<hes> ang ginawa natin sa ating presentation ay inangat natin 'yung level of playing field .	what we did in our presentation is we have raised the level of playing field .
<14>	(110.800-117.790)	hindi natin <hes> tinapatan ang <hes> China sa in terms of resources and facilities kasi alam naman nating under dog tayo .	we have not matched China in terms of resources and facilities because we already know we are an underdog .
<15>	(117.790-120.279)	itong labanan David versus Goliath .	this fight David versus Goliath .
<16>	(120.279-122.089)	suntok sa buwan itong ginawa natin .	what we have done is a leap of faith .
<17>	(122.089-130.417)	and we almost were there because <hes> sabi mo nga Chiqui nagkaroon sila ng two-timed delay bago nila in-announce 'yung decision because nahirapan sila .	and we almost were there because as you have said Chiqui they had two-timed delay before they have announced the decision because had a difficulty .
<18>	(130.417-133.713)	the easier decision would have been to hand it to China right away .	the easier decision would have been to hand it to China right away .
<19>	(133.713-142.830)	but because napakaganda ng presentasyon ng Philippines napakaganda ng ating pagsasabi ng puso ang ating pagmamahal sa basketball .	but because the presentation of the Philippines is so beautiful they way we said it with a heart is so beautiful our love for basketball .
<20>	(142.830-146.679)	eh napag-isip isipan din ng central board bago sila nagbigay ng decision .	so the central board has also realized before they gave the decision .
<21>	(146.679-154.206)	but I think <hes> Chiqui no in the end it was hard and fast rules of resources .	but I think Chiqui well in the end it was hard and fast rules of resources .
<22>	(154.206-154.448)	uhm .	uhm .
<23>	(154.448-162.326)	kung sino bang mas malaki kung sino mas maraming hotel rooms kung sinong mas maraming venues 'yung ang pinag-usapan ng central board at kaniya nabigay sa China .	of who is bigger of who has more hotel rooms of who has more venues that is discussed in the central board and it is given to China .
<24>	(162.326-170.879)	tingin ko nahirapan din sila to take their emotions out of the equation kasi mismong sila mismo ng China ang nagsabi nga na nadala din sila sa ating presentasyon .	I think they also had a difficulty to take their emotions out of the equation because they themselves in China said they are also moved by our presentation .
<25>	(170.879-178.781)	siguro nahirapan din ang <hes> ang FIBA panel to try to get that out of their heads and really think <hes> you know along the lines of <hes> pragmatism o practicality .	perhaps the FIBA panel also had a difficulty to try to get that out of their heads and really think you know along the lines of pragmatism or practicality .
