<1>	(0.000-12.652)	<sta> sa pamamagitan ng paggawa ng mga props na para sa mga cost players naipapakita ni Aldrin ang kaniyang talento at pagkamalikhain <sta> kahit pa hindi naman niya pormal na pinag-aralan ang ganitong bagay .	by making props for cosplayers Aldrin is able to show his talent and creativity even if he hasn't formally studied this kind of thing .
<2>	(12.652-13.610)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<3>	(13.610-16.700)	<sta> so kailan mo natutunan iyong mga props na ganito ?	so when did you learn props like this ?
<4>	(16.700-36.315)	<sta> <hes> actually noong una kasi akong nag-learn is sa <hes> parang natutunan ko lang kung <sta> looking at other cost player kasi lahat noon nag-umpisa mga five years ago or so <hes> kasi nag-umpisa ako five years ago <overlap> uh huh and naisipan ko <sta> parang ang cool naman ng mga costume na parang gusto ko ring gumawa noon .	actually when I first started to learn it was in it's as if I just learned by looking at other cosplayers because before everyone started five years ago or so because I started five years ago uh huh and I thought the costumes were cool like I also wanted to make them .
<5>	(36.315-37.600)	uh huh .	uh huh .
<6>	(37.600-43.090)	<sta> yeah kaya ito na medyo okay naman -- okay naman iyong ginawa ko .	yeah so here it is it seems okay -- what I'm doing seems okay .
<7>	(43.090-49.030)	<sta> accuracy o katumpakan ang habol ng bawat cost players sa mga costume nilang sinusuot .	accuracy and precision are what cosplayers are looking for in the costumes that they are wearing .
<8>	(49.030-55.910)	<sta> mas malapit sa kinokopyang karakter mas mapanatag at mas may kumpiyansa ang isang cost player .	the closer it is to the character being copied the more comfortable and confident a cosplayer is .
<9>	(55.910-62.550)	<sta> actually umm kung you're gonna ask me accuracy wise sobrang accurate it was umm <overlap> nakuha niya .	actually um if you're gonna ask me accuracy-wise it was very accurate um he got it .
<10>	(62.550-67.787)	<sta> from here palang iyong embroidery details uh huh din dito iyan emboss lahat di ba ?	just from here the embroidery details uh huh also this is where they will all be embossed right ?
<11>	(67.787-70.920)	<sta> kasi iyan na iyan talaga iyan specially dito sa part na ito .	because that's really it especially on this part .
<12>	(70.920-87.030)	<sta> usually kasi iyong mga other na nagpapa- -- M_T_O kami <sta> iyong mga ganito hindi nila nakukuha iyong tamang size uh huh or the actual height noong mga cost players <overlap> uh huh <sta> usually kasi pagka maliit si cost player sobrang laki dito so parang <overlap> uh huh hindi siya nagiging accurate .	because usually for others who have -- M_T_O for things like this they are not able to get the right size uh huh or the actual height of the cosplayers uh huh because usually if the cosplayer is small it would be too big here so it's like uh huh it doesn't become accurate .
<13>	(87.030-90.115)	<sta> so ang ganda talaga nakuha niya lahat specially doon sa shield .	so it's really nice he was able to capture everything especially with the shield .
<14>	(90.115-93.800)	<sta> sakto lang siya if we're gonna hahawakan ko siya .	it's just right if we're gonna I'm going to hold it .
<15>	(93.800-97.257)	<sta> sakto lang siya sa akin <overlap> excited ka na ba sa event <overlap> excited na ako sobra .	it fits me well are you excited about the event I'm really excited .
<16>	(97.257-98.393)	<sta> Belle nakita mo siya .	Belle did you see her .
<17>	(98.393-99.440)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<18>	(99.440-104.010)	<sta> sa aking napansin hindi biro ang pagiging cost play props at costume maker .	from what I have observed being a cosplay props and costume maker is no joke .
<19>	(104.010-111.655)	<sta> dahil mga panatiko ang mga kliyente kadalasan ay metikuloso sa mga detalye at mataas ang basehan ng mga ito <sta> sa kalidad .	since the clients are fanatics they are usually meticulous with details and they have high bases in quality .
<20>	(111.655-116.500)	<sta> sa mga ganiyan ba for example ano iyong pinakamahirap na part ng paggawa ?	with those for example what is the most difficult part of creating ?
<21>	(116.500-130.623)	<sta> umm sa palagay ko is iyong size comparison depende doon sa tao <overlap> mm kasi minsan sabi nga ni Jaime minsan ma- -- iba-iba iyong size <overlap> maliit iyong cost player tapos iyong <sta> susuotin is ma- -- malaki talaga tapos kailangan marami kang baguhin .	um in my opinion it is the size comparison depending on the person mm because sometimes like what Jaime said sometimes -- the size varies the cosplayer is small then what he will wear is big -- really big so you need to make a lot of adjustments .
<22>	(130.623-139.920)	<sta> so normally <sta> doon ako nahihirapan lalo na sa mga ganitong bagay is free hand uh huh <overlap> talaga siya wala siyang -- wala siyang measurements uh huh <overlap> ganito talagang (()) mo ng paggawa .	so normally that's where I have difficulty especially since these things are really freehand uh huh it has no -- it has no measurements uh huh this is really (()) your way of creating .
<23>	(139.920-149.636)	<sta> uh huh tapos kapag mali pa kailangan mong ulitin para <int> <sta> makuha mo ang gusto ng costumer <overlap> ano iyong pinakamahirap na costume or props na nagawa mo ?	uh huh then when it's wrong you need to do it again so you can meet the demand of the customer what is the most difficult costume or props that you have made ?
<24>	(149.636-155.780)	<sta> I think <sta> noong kaibigan ko ang me gumawa kami ng seven foot na sword .	I think it was when my friend and I we made a seven-foot sword .
<25>	(155.780-165.750)	<sta> seven foot <overlap> and they extend to eight foot kasi for a convention parang siyang (()) <sta> from a character <overlap> uh huh na talagang napakala- -- napakalaki ng sword .	seven-foot and they extend to eight feet because it was for a convention it was like (()) from a character uh huh that was really big -- the sword was really big .
<26>	(165.750-166.136)	uh huh .	uh huh .
<27>	(166.136-173.220)	<sta> tapos <hes> ginawa namin siya for three days kasi iyong customer namin eh nagmamadali din siya .	then we made it for three days because our customer seemed to be in a hurry too .
<28>	(173.220-173.593)	uh huh .	uh huh .
<29>	(173.593-181.070)	eh <sta> <hes> na naga- -- nagawa naman namin siya umabot naman sa time <overlap> uh huh sa palagay ko iyon ang pinakamahirap .	so we were able to make -- make it we made it on time uh huh I think that was the most difficult .
<30>	(181.070-190.103)	<sta> dahil isang cost player din si Aldrin naiintindihan niya ang laki ng gastos ng bawat cost player upang matamo <sta> ang nais nilang kasuutan .	because Aldrin is also a cosplayer he understands the big expenses of each cosplayer in order to achieve the outfit that they want .
<31>	(190.103-233.200)	<sta> kaya kapag may lumalapit sa kaniyang mga cost players <sta> hindi rin kasi iyong kasing eh iyon kasing iba is napakamahal dahil sa -- anong tawag dito sa mga labor nila <overlap> umm so <sta> as me mga -- yung cosplayer is talagang nasa passion and hobby na gusto ko is <sta> nag-e-enjoy ako iyong iba makapag- -- enjoy din na makuha iyong gusto nilang mga <sta> costume na ipapagawa nila <overlap> at a low cost <overlap> uh huh at the low cost <overlap> uh huh minsan kasi kapag mga tao is <sta> iyong mga lalapit na uh huh gusto nila iyong cosplay this character tapos napakamahal eh kailangan nilang mag-back out kasi hindi nila kasya iyong ay hindi -- hindi nila kaya iyong presyo .	so when there are cosplayers who approach him it's not that's because some are really expensive because of -- what do you call this their labor umm so as me there are -- the cosplayer really has this as his passion and hobby what I want is for me to enjoy while others are able to -- enjoy getting the costumes that they want to be made at a low cost uh huh at the low cost uh huh sometimes when people are about to approach uh huh they want to cosplay this character but it's very expensive so they need to back out because they won't fit oops no -- they cannot afford the price .
<32>	(233.200-241.000)	uh huh <sta> so ayon tinutulungan ko lang if gusto nilang cost play or normally tinuturuan ko sila if kung gusto nila .	uh huh so I just help them if they want to do cosplay or normally I would teach them if if they want .
<33>	(241.000-243.010)	<sta> parang nagiging sideline mo na rin siya ?	it's like it's becoming your sideline too ?
<34>	(243.010-244.000)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<35>	(244.000-250.360)	<sta> parang ganoon na nga <overlap> uh huh at least kumikita ka na tapos is na -- na gusto mo pa ano nag-e-enjoy ka pa tapos gusto mo pa iyong ginagawa mo .	looks like it yes at least at least you're earning and then -- you like it you are enjoying it and then you like what you are doing .
<36>	(250.360-266.070)	<sta> importante din sa ganitong kalakaran ang petsa o deadline kung kailan matatapos ang props na ginagawa ng isang props maker <sta> ng sa gayon mayroon pang panahon upang baguhin o palitan ang disenyo na ayon sa kagustuhan ng kliyente .	in this trade the date or deadline when the props created by a props maker is also important that way there will be time to change or switch the design according to the preference of the client .
<37>	(266.070-268.086)	<sta> parang complain deadline ganoon ?	like a complain deadline right ?
<38>	(268.086-269.680)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>

<41>	(278.360-279.766)	one month puwede na iyon sa iyo ?	one month that's okay for you ?

<59>	(337.620-344.380)	<sta> para sa kaginhawaan ng kaniyang kliyente dapat din alamin ni Aldrin ang mga materyales na dapat niyang gamitin .	for the convenience of his client Aldrin should also know the materials that he must use .
