<1>	(0.000-9.968)	<sta> nagkaayos na sina Claudine Barretto at ang dalawang ground crew ng Cebu Pacific na nasigawan at minura umano ng aktres noong a-sais ng Mayo matapos malamang na-offload ang kanilang bagahe .	Claudine Barretto and the two ground crew of the Cebu Pacific who were allegedly shouted at and cursed by the actress on the sixth of May after learning that their luggage were offloaded have made up .
<2>	(9.968-13.770)	itinanggi rin maging ng ground crew na minura sila .	even the ground crew denied that they were cursed .
<3>	(13.770-17.160)	wala rin umanong planong magsampa ng reklamo ang dalawa laban sa aktres .	the two supposedly don't have plans of filing a complaint against the actress .
<4>	(17.160-28.218)	<sta> alamin po natin ang reaksiyon ng <hes> kabilang kampo makakausap po natin sa linya ng telepono <sta> si attorney Jovito Barte abogado po ni Ramon Tulfo .	let us find out the reaction of the opposite camp we will be able to talk on the phone line with Attorney Jovito Barte lawyer of Ramon Tulfo .
<5>	(28.218-31.030)	<sta> <hes> umagang kay ganda po attorney .	good morning attorney .
<6>	(31.030-33.066)	umagang kay ganda ka Tunying .	good morning Tunying .
<7>	(33.066-35.467)	opo <hes> attorney ano po ang reaksiyon ninyo ?	yes attorney what is your reaction ?
<8>	(35.467-38.069)	nagkaayos na raw po 'yung <hes> 'yung dalawang panig .	they've supposedly made up the the two sides .
<9>	(38.069-48.360)	'yung pong <hes> kampo po 'nong <hes> ni Claudine 'tsaka po 'nong dalawang ground crew na <hes> 'yun po naman ang <hes> naging mitsa ng <hes> kaguluhan sa NAIA .	the camp of Claudine and then of the two ground crew that was became the source of the trouble in NAIA .
<10>	(48.360-53.689)	well sa nabanggit mo nga 'yun nga 'yung dalawang naging mitsa sa kaguluhan sa NAIA ano ?	well from what you mentioned those two became the source of trouble in NAIA right ?
<11>	(53.689-60.040)	well dalawang bagay una nakakatuwa din dahil nagkaayos na sila .	well two things first it's pleasing because they already made up .
<12>	(60.040-65.570)	ayaw naman ni mister Tulfo na <hes> talagang hindi sila magkaayos .	Mister Tulfo doesn't want for them to not really make up .
<13>	(65.570-88.540)	pangalawa nakakalungkot lang ding malaman na 'yung dalawang supposedly na <hes> inialay ni mister Tulfo 'yung kaniyang buhay ay <hes> 'yun nga parang bumaligtad dahil ang na- -- rinig ko yata parang ni-retract 'yung ano eh sinabi na hindi <overlap> so nakakalungkot ho iyon .	second it's saddening to know that the two supposedly whom Mister Tulfo offered his life for seem to have turned around because -- I heard they probably retracted what they said no it's saddening .
<14>	(88.540-89.135)	bakit ho ?	why ?
<15>	(89.135-97.584)	kasi <hes> kung tutuusin n'yo 'yun ho 'yung <hes> rason kung bakit nasadlak si Mon sa ganyang kaguluhan .	because if considered that is the reason why Mon fell into that mess .
<16>	(97.584-109.219)	pero sana pa man kahit nagkaayos sila ay hindi matiklop ang kanilang bibig sa katotohanan pag nagkaroon na ng ano- -- ng trial sa kaso .	but hopefully even if they made up their mouth won't shut for the truth when there will be a -- case trial .
<17>	(109.219-128.650)	<hes> attorney Barte <hes> tutal nabanggit n'yo <hes> po 'yung kaso hindi po kaya hihina naman 'yung <hes> legal <hes> stand ng inyo pong kliyente dahil <hes> ang sabi po mismo 'nong dalawa -- 'nong dalawang ground crew ay hindi sila minura .	Attorney Barte now that you mentioned it the case won't it weaken the legal stand of your client because what the two themselves said -- two ground crew they were not cursed .
<18>	(128.650-136.550)	well kung napansin n'yo sa unang press statement ni ng mother ni miss Bokbok .	well if you noticed in the first press statement of the mother of Miss Bokbok .
<19>	(136.550-137.230)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<20>	(137.230-145.626)	ito pa nga ay naiyak sa T_V <cough> dahil <hes> sabi niya to quote na hindi ko pinalaki ang aking anak para murahin .	she even cried on T_V because to quote she said I did not raise my child just to be cussed at .
<21>	(145.626-156.980)	so siguro doon pa lang ay makikita natin na mayroon <hes> pag-alipusta na ginawa si miss Barretto .	so maybe just there we can see that there is abuse done by Miss Barretto .
<22>	(156.980-163.400)	kaya nga ito ay nakatawag pansin kay mister Tulfo para kuhanan .	which is why it called the attention of Mister Tulfo to record .
<23>	(163.400-163.817)	opo .	yes .
<24>	(163.817-165.772)	<overlap> at ito rin ang nagdala sa kaniya ng gulo .	and it is also what brought him trouble .
<25>	(165.772-176.270)	sa tingin ninyo bakit po <hes> <hes> umatras sa kanilang <hes> naunang statement ika nga ninyo <hes> 'yung dalawang ground crew na minura po sila ni Claudine ?	in your opinion why they withdrew from their earlier statement like you said the two ground crew who were cursed at by Claudine ?
<26>	(176.270-179.312)	maraming ano eh maraming puwedeng maging rason eh .	there are many many possible reasons .
<27>	(179.312-179.815)	opo .	yes .
<28>	(179.815-188.170)	kaya lang siyempre kung banggitin ko man 'yun <hes> ito ay tatanggapin nilang haka-haka .	but of course if I mention that they will accept it as speculation .
<29>	(188.170-188.539)	opo .	yes .
<30>	(188.539-190.074)	ito po 'yung huling tanong ko .	this is my last question .
<31>	(190.074-194.800)	wala po ba kayong nakikitang areglo dito <hes> sa dalawang panig ?	don't you see any arrangement here with the two sides ?
<32>	(194.800-213.436)	well <hes> sa kampo po ni mister Tulfo alam ninyo (()) lang naman ho kami siyempre saya ho 'yung na-agrabiyado dito and 'yun ang nakakalungkot siya pa ang lumala- -- palalabasin ng kabilang kampo na nagsimula ng lahat .	well in the camp of Mister Tulfo you know (()) we are just of course he was the one who was inconvenienced here and what's saddening here is he is the one -- made to look like the one who started it all by the opposite camp .
<33>	(213.436-221.689)	<cough> <hes> kitang-kita sa video na kahit anong bali-baliktarin mo siya 'yung na-agrabiyado at na-overpower .	obvious in the video no matter what you do that he was the one who was inconvenienced and overpowered .
<34>	(221.689-235.090)	in effect parang na-neutralize talaga siya totally in fact if not for the intervention of the security kahit na nga ganoon 'yung reaksiyon nila siguro mas worse pa ang damage na na-cause sa kaniya .	in effect it's like he was really neutralized totally in fact if not for the intervention of the security even if their reaction is like that maybe the damage caused on him is much worse .
