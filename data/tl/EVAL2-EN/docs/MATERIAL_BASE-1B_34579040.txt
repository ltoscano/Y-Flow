Does the Kapuso TV management do not have a heart?!

A big protest is being conducted by the journalists against the Kapuso GMA-7 because of the issue of an intensive conversation.
But it is not a simple word that involved the journalists involved in GMA-7 or "the Kapuso network that is called by the Kapuso network.
A few journalists in the Kapuso network is being swept by the management, "epal."
"Talaba," they said that they were not included in the regular employees of GMA-7.
If in a common factory, the call of them is called by them.
In the other hand, they will be paid, based on a job that they have seen.
But in the Kapuso network, the call of them is being called based on the production they bought.
This is the style, because, just because they will be released, they cannot accept a "payment, or they consider as a payment for the Kapuso network until they do not have any salary (AR) or official).
"That is the problem of those so-called" Atong "in the Kapuso network.
Before they send a receipt, they need to undergo the process that caused the dancas to rot.
In this process, they are going to spend for the lowest of P5,000, and when they have permits to spend without less than 10,000 pesos, we also need to spend so that it will not be less than 10,000 pesos in order for us not to receive a small amount, and there will be no one to accept them.
Just imagine, before they collect the amount of P7,000 in the lowest at GMA 7, they need to spend no less than 5,000 pesos!
Walis in fact?
Isn't it clear that the Kapuso network is not clear to their obligation and responsibility to what they are calling for, but the truth is still taking them their duties which is more than a regular employee!

For us, we hope for the two parties to get along with just a justifiable agreement.
The Kapuso management will not lose anything, if they will face the militant employees to fix the issue that has been utilized by the ranks of journalists.
