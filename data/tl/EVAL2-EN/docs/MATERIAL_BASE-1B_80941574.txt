You are true.

You are all about you, your life is your own responsibility.

All the events are at the end of your hands, no one can make your personality or can create your character more because it comes from the depths of your self, and there is no one who can help or get to.

There are many things that seem to be done in your life - without any changes, from the birth of birth, it will continue to end up and lose faith in what happened to you, it will be finished if you continue to be broken and lose faith in what happened to you, that it will be strengthened and firm in this world.

Do not forget that you are the extraordinary, only one and no one like this world.

You have the power to choose what is good, happy, peaceful and what's happening in your life, there is no assurance, that it is always on negative, opinions, to grieve.

You are the only one who would make you happy.

Physical activities will be followed in the eyes, but the beauty is from the depths of a heart attack.
