Beware of talking and act, stop and ask yourself if what you will say will create anger, fear, admiration, admiration, care of your own intention to know your real intentions before being mistreated and made an action.

Act according to your goal to serve and help others in peace and effective, praise and imitate others who are making good and helpful to many.

Don't wake up with a small voice that will help you and put you a failure, if there is a failure, if there is a failure, there is a failure, if there is a failure, there is food in life, and there is always food in your life, there is always in the hands of success.
