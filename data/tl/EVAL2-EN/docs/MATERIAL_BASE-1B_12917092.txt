We can say that de Lima is really brave.
According to October 4, 2016 although President Rody Duterte and his allies in the Senate and Congress did not move, "de Lima still cannot move, that the people in the Senate were not moved to remind that the government will continue to remind their fight against illegal drugs.
Last month, there was a news from an Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) that was taken by some police in a checkpoint, but after one day, the police found out that this kind of incident was going to go out and the ordinary citizens will continue to go out and they will lose more trust in our police.
Duterte himself admitted that he made a mistake in the revelation of a few names in his drug-list, I was impressed by Duterte because he admitted the mistake and asked for forgiveness.
Here we can see that our government should be careful now in the search of suspected drug pushers and drug lord that they can be mistaken as well and what they killed is a innocent Filipino in order to determine and be sure who really is the real criminals and who only has been mistaken for.
In truth, the criminals like Herbert Cologne, who went to Congress to blame De Lima, how can you trust a criminal who killed 10 innocent employees of the bank that does not have a fight?
Of course, Colangco is going to do with those who want to do and bring them to them by our Department of Justice (DOJ) because if they do not follow, they might be protected from the New Bilibid Prison.
I also do not agree with what speaker Pantaleon Alvarez said to show the said sex video of De Lima, first of all, we do not know if de Lima is the one who has a sex video, "that is.
But what is most important is the plan of his plan to release the Congress in order if Alvarez will push through, many will surely lose faith in our lawmakers in Congress.
