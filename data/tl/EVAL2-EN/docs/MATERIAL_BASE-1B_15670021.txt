The campaign against drugs will prove the whole world.
By editing July 20, 2016.
Up to 88,000 drug pushers and medals in the whole country have surrendered according to the record of government offices that are focused on the campaign against illegal drugs.
Because of the big number of those who are going to be assigned to the drug dependent, the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Ismael Sueno will not be a record for him to be the record of the Guinness World Records as it is not in the country he can make the operation.
It is a good sign that the Philippines is not a good sign that it is good because the number of those who have surrendered to illegal drugs are not good because this is a proof that this is the huge number of those who have surrendered to illegal drugs, that is why it is proof that this is the huge number of those who have surrendered to the illegal drugs who have surrendered.
What would we do with the number of those who surrendered if there is no change happening to our countrymen who surrendered.
Along with the surrender of the drug dependent, they will finally turn your back from their bad vices and hopefully the loved ones or any community will give their support to our fellowmen who wants to change their lives.
