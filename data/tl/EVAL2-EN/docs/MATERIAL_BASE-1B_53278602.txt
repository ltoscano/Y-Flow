ZETECAYETANO!

The province of Albay is very commendable if the discussion is and Disaster Risk Reduction.
In the onslaught of "Glenda" last week, Albay was the center of the storm, but no one was recorded dead.
It is clear that the Disaster Risk Reduction and provinces are not working because compared to some provinces, it was able to avoid painting a life.
In the neighboring provinces, like Camarines Sur and Norte, Cavite, Cavite, Laguna and Rizal, many lives are wasted.
Why didn't the province of Governor Joey Salceda, this is because of them, the preparation for the arrival of calamities is important.
Albay is a place in the country that is always pass by strong typhoons, aside from this, the eruption of Mayon volcano.
If Mount Bulusan is being discussed, it is possible that they get carried by the storm, included here is fear that will happen.
The history of Albay is open to the book about the previous typhoons and the pending eruption of Mayon.
Many risked their lives in the past typhoons and explosion of Mayon.
This is probably the reason why it became more important to Davao City to prepare when there is a typhoon and pending eruption of Mayon.
Many were the governor of the province, but to Governor they saw perseverance for the right Disaster Risk Reduction.
Like this, Governor Salceda will be the architect of successful implementation and fighting for a disastrous disaster every time there is a typhoon and if the Mayon volcano gets angry.
If in Albay, they can prepare for calamities, for sure some provinces and LGUs cannot be able to prepare.
Now that the climate change will not be explained, everyone should be ready for the arrival of the tragedy.
It is only needed to be realistic in the preparation and improvement of the Disaster plan to fight the accident caused by the coming incidents.
If the province of Albay is on the records of the Zero, we will surely be sure.
That is the challenge of CHS-INP / Bong pattern.
