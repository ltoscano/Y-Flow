PNR does not have a system.

Aksyon Ngayon "by Al G. this is an action.

If this is going to implement the system of Philippine National Railways (PNR) like what is implemented by the MRT and LRT, it will not go bankrupt because the PNR is still a big help in the lack of transportation.
Why are they suffering?
Just because the train of PNR is fed up in the places where they are located, there might be someone who will ride in the train so you can't blame these people who want to bring them up because of poverty.
But if the PNR is going to be modern, it is possible that there would be an administrative system that is like LRT and MRT, there should be a person watching the PNR in the doors of every tram so that there will be no stubborn passengers.
The government should also take advantage of the removal of illegal settlers affected at the side of the railway because it is a danger zone and what if there is a train to disqualify and hit the residents? It is dangerous.
In the hearing of the House Committee on Transportation, PNR General Manager Allan Dukhovnaia, the passengers were not paying every fare every month, aside from that, there were passengers who were riding a ticket, which is why there were passengers who were not able to buy a ticket, which is why he bought a lotto ticket to run for P10 million pesos.

That's why in order to solve the said problem, they are planning to create modern equipment from the PNR.
Modernization should be really needed so that the government will not bear the amount of spending if there are no private sector who will invest.
The amount needed by the PNR is approximately 70 billion for the modernization of its line from Malolos, Bulacan to Calamba, Laguna and will go to Public Private Consignation.
