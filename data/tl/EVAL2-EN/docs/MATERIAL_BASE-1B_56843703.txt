Tribe of PNoy, useless!

Congratulations!

The tribe of PNoy in giving assistance to those affected by typhoon Yolanda and it seems that the government is useless so he could not file an effective order in the affected areas.
This is the point and point of COA chairman Grace Tan when he asked about the donations that arrived in our country for the victims of said calamity.
Even if PNoy is not able to admit it, they do not want to keep the failure that they have done since Yolanda hit the country even if the COA chairman is becoming a hero!
It is clear that the observation of the COA (failure, no system and lack of information, but we should understand the government because until now it is a failure and it is as if there is a failure and it is as if they are useless on their throne?
Let us enumerate the people, for the first days only because the airport is first cleaned in Tacloban City - it turns out that the airports in Tacloban City - it turns out that the airports in Tacloban City - it is so that the airports in Tacloban City will be able to leave, including Boy's tribe, not yet!
Later on, the help from other countries came first than the help from PNoy's tribe, and when we suddenly heard that robbery in the area has been widespread, not yet!
After a few days have passed, "thank you, the Philippine government is an issue," the general of PNoy, said that the general of the police said that 10,000 are dead from the typhoon.
What would be the right?
After 100 days, there was still a lot of aid that did not reach PNoy's tribe while there was still a group in Malacanang but there was just a group in Malacanang, but after reaching up AB. Kana's entrance, hahaha!
For the useless and failure of PNoy from the past until now, and I think that it is up to June 2016 when those are like that, should we understand each other?
