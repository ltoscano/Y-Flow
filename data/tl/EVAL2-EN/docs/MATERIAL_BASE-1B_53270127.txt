Is the Philippines ready for Ebola?

Durian Shake by Edith Regalado (Filipino Star Ngayon) - October 19, 2014 - 12: 00.

A doctor admitted that it was really difficult to fight about Ebola virus that killed more than 4,000 lives in Africa who killed more than 4,000 lives in Africa who have already reached the United States where it was initially reported that the one who died was the one who was recorded dead.
The center for the disease control of America has no stop in giving importance to the situation of two other people who are said to be a positive positive of Ebola after their burial, Dunenas.
The US has a hard time to suppress Ebola when it has been positive that it has reached their country.
The CDC also said that it is possible that the two boxers will also complain about Ebola because they had a breach of protocol in taking care of Dunenas.
But other doctors in America also complained because what was really the protocol in taking care of someone about Ebola, except for chemicals.
What is really your communication with protocol in spite of Ebola?
That is it and it looks like nothing until now.
So, the US does not know how to kill Ebola.
The question now is if our country is ready for that kind of illness.
How can one Ebola virus be fooled?
Is our hospital and the Department of Health Office to treatment to Ebola virus.
That is what a doctor said that I talked to.
That's why we cannot handle an epidemic like Ebola.
The American government continues to discuss about Ebola in the US, and the more things that we are feared is if there will be a widespread pity for many people for this illness.
Our government should also act on this problem even before everything becomes too late.
