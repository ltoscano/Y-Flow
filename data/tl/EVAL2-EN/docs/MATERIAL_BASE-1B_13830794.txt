Don't you want to love?

A loving heart will start all your knowledge.

Accept and make the minds that are similar in the garden of the flowers, continue to care, and take care of all people who are in love and to get to know, that this is a thing that we need to love and get to know each other when we remain to love another until we love our self.

Those criticizing, blaming, with no respect, infidelity, and poverty which are handling the veins that are destroying the veins that can be seen from its wounds when there is a need of understanding, understanding, and concern.
