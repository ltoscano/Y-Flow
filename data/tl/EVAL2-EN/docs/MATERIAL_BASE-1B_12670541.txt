Temptation: Reflection of the 1st week of Lent year-A - March 9, 2014 - the year of the Century.

A father, which is currently celebrating his 25th birthday, is that it would be better for us to wait for a temptation of my life, but it is still waiting for us to celebrate a temptation of my life, but it is still waiting for us to celebrate a temptation of my life, but it is still waiting for us to celebrate a temptation of my life, but it is still waiting for us to celebrate a temptation of my life, but it is still waiting for us to celebrate a temptation of my life, but it is still waiting for us to meet the temptation of our life, "that is why we can see that we have no more admiration for us," that is why we can let us see this kind of temptation in our life.
