PhilHealth and PhilHealth.

The Aquino government should focus on the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) because the management of the current administration will be considered a weakness that will be given by Alexander Padilla.
The problem here is not a joke that there are 600 provinces in the whole country that may possibly be the cause of disappearance or trace of giving benefits to our poor countrymen who are just depending on the benefits of the said agency.
The private hospital's threat was heavy because they were carrying all the PhilHealth card vehicles and the expenses in the hospital and it is up to the members of its members who will take care of the office of Padilla.
It has been a long time problem for the hospitals, even if it is public or private, the trend of PhilHealth failed because it is really rotten and slow in its process.
Currently up to 80 million Filipinos are members of PhilHealth, so we can say that our countrymen depends on it.
The said number is heavy as if we will decrease it because there is a difficult life that is the reason why there is a huge number of PhilHealth, this is also being used by the politicians in what they did to the people.
We do not want to reach a use of PhilHealth to a ship that is why Malacanang should immediately act on it because the Filipino masses will be affected by this.
A solution is what the people need for the issue of PhilHealth and it should be immediately moved immediately because the whole system of giving health care or programs is possible to give in the health condition if PNoy will not respond.
