Lady traffic enforcers, fix it!

The management of the Metro Manila Development Authority is good to spread the traffic traffic enforcer on the streets of Manila.
First, women who are horseshoe, it is better to look at the men enforcers, especially when their stomach is big.
The lady traffic is more disciplined at work and they are more serious and cannot just be seen as a snob, but the truth is, he gets angry with the woman who has traffic.
Police enforcers would not be greedy for men.
That is why there are a lot of male traffic enforcers who patronize it because of those with vices.
If a man enforcer is a womanizer, drunkard and gay, he is forced to extort just to spend for his vices.
So fix us is the spread of the lady traffic enforcers in Metro Manila.

I am impressed by the MMDA traffic enforcer which I see in the middle of the evening along Commonwealth Avenue in front of UP Campus.
They were on the motorcycle that they were riding on, that's because they were shot by the truck, for an unknown reason.
I am wondering why the trucks are prohibited to pass in the said place.
That is why there are the MMDA enforcer because they also get a lot of money which were snatched by the truck Hanz ano?

DPWH is wanted to remove the Rotonda in Anda Circle, according to him it will be transferred inside the Intramuros so the traffic in Bonifacio Drive will be postponed.
Many those who are opposing are the plans of DPWH is not really a solution to the flow of traffic due to the number of those who are roaming around Metro Manila.
A truck driver said that the real cause of traffic is the lack of serious traffic enforcer.
We see a lot of traffic enforcer but they are not really fixing the traffic even if they are busy waiting for those who will be caught in order to have a commission and vote.
This is the attitude that should be removed and not the historic Rotonda in Anda Circle.
