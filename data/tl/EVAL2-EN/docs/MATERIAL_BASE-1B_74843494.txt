Because the theme of the movie Camp Alagar of this week is about the different kinds of abuse being made by stars Andi Eigenmann, Arci Muñoz, Bela Padilla, Robin Padilla and Kim Molina, they want to know how they move on on what happened in their life.
Bela Padilla said.
"I, in our country, which is why I have been going to go and let us go to.
"I worked for a long time so I lost a time to cry, or thinking, until he / she was gone (the feelings) of the initiative."
Meanwhile, according to Rica.
"In my opinion, I was easy to move on so I was able to move away with FRIENDS, a gimmick, happy, but when I go home, I cry," I thought I am going to sleep.
"So what I can do after that, it is okay" when you feel the pain and you will also get tired of it, so that you can be happy, but, I do not need to rush it. "
Andi did not speak.
"I, I thought, I turned my attention to others.

"For others, it's as if I was able to build-up my own world whom I have been used to with him, even if you are used to him, it can be remembered that you can see him / her, I believe in that."
Arci Muñoz is.
"Maybe, four or five years passed before she was able to move on, and I thought, she was able to move on, but I was still unknown when I saw Pictures, she cried.
"What I can say is for you to move on, Fight IT.
Kim is the scene of Kim.
