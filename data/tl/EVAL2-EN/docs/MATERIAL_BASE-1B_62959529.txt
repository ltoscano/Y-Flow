According to witnesses, was they used?
Jimmy and Jimmy Cantos, September 24, 2016) there are many who feel pity when what happened in the Senate recently where the chairwoman of Committee on Justice Secretary Leila de Lima was removed.
Because the style is, Senator Manny Pacquiao is the motion to bury the international ship while having a ship in the said committee.
The question of many, is it used by the Pambansang Kamao, perhaps, there are times that the hearing that is being done in the Senate about the extrajudicial killing or murder of those who are illegal drug pushers and bullets and the House hearing regarding the said illegal drug trade in Bilibid.
What is revealed in the two hearing is alarming.
In the Senate hearing, it is said that President Duterte has a blessing on the murder of Davao Death Squad while the House hearing was like a movie about Mafia, drug addict and payola in order not to stop the drug trade inside Bilibid.
Along with the Pambansang Kamao in the majority of the Senate, that is why it is expected that even if the action of the said group will be heard, we will hear no matter how fight against Pacman.
Isn't it that once Pacman said that he does not have anything against the evidence happening about the war of Duterte against illegal drugs?
The imagination said, that's why Pacman agreed to be the motion to make the Committee on Justice is so that he will not be endorsed by his fellow senators if he will fight against Vargas in America in November.
Maybe, this is not the case.

But the question is if Pacman understands what is happening in the Senate and for the people who will just be left dead on the side of the road because of the said involvement of illegal drugs.
Another question: Can he fulfill the good and right of Pacman and De Lima on their jobs as senator?
