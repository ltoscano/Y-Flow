GSIS eTECAYETANO!

In their TV and Hacademics, if you will not experience the truth, you will think that the contribution of the government Security System (GSIS) is very beautiful and very fast because you did not end the set number of months and that's not finished!
We personally experienced this in the last week of February of this year, the system is simple, and our wish is simple and we only wish to bring my contribution.
So in the form of form, what I wrote like is that, what I said to them is what they said to their personnel at the customer Service of GSIS Quezon City in Mindanao Avenue, we were told to just wait for what I will wait, I don't know!
On April 16, we received a letter from GSIS eCard.
On May 17, we went to the follow-up and the answer is my request to restore the Supreme Court's fund!?
When I asked why, it is wrong for me to be wrong for the fund for my fund, because it is said that it is wrong for this law like Presidential Legal Wife, Administrative Order, Republic Act, and whatever cost of the law!
You are the one who knows the right about how the document has to be done, you are the one who put them up to Malacañang, you might be wrong with your boss in Malacañang.
We also witnessed a lot of applicants, which is unintentionally revealed that the process is unintentionally made for a snack not only in Quezon City but also in all branches, including the station.
What is written on me is simple, why are you different, why, for me, what you are asking for is simple, what you are asking for is to make other policies, right?
Because of what you did for us, we are going around to gather the complaint against the GSIS eCard.
Sure, if you are fond of making lines, we will release the lines of your abuse especially to retired people who are having a hard time!
