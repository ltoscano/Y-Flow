Marcos to leave the SC - Congress; Congress is the one who needs to decide - Ramos By AFP, Aries Con August 14, 2016.
If Senate President Aquilino "Koko" Pimentel III will be asked, it is favorable to raise the group of Martial Law victims of former President Ferdinand Marcos in the Libingan ng mga Bayani (SC) that the Congress should decide if Marcos should be buried in the Heroes' Cemetery.
"What happens is that," that is one of the things that they should do because President Duterte is just looking at the burial of the Supreme Court, "he said that it can be buried in the Supreme Court," it is better if there is a group that will question the Supreme Court.
There is also no problem with the leaders of the Senate if some of the senators who are members of the majority of Hec are included in the protests today that they cannot stop them and free to go with the burial of Marcos in the Libingan ng mga Bayani.
"I said, let us go to a hurry in deciding.
Ramos has proposed to release any lawmakers about the burial of Marcos because this reflects the will of the people.
Ramos served in the military under Marcos until he went with the protests to remove it from 1986 when he became the secretary of the Department of National Defense and became president from 1992 until 1998.
