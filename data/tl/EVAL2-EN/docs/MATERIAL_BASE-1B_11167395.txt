Uncle Sam will help her.

It is not right for us to meddle with any country regarding the heart issue of the Philippines, "that is what we strongly belief! As they say, whichever neighbor does not have the right to meddle with or have any conflict inside our house.
But if the "poor and a person who owns a house is being thrown away, being thrown away and the honor is no consideration and another neighbor, it is just right that he / she'll take care of some members of the community?
"That is the current situation of our country that they cannot move because of the consecutive incidents that are currently bedridden on the mat with poverty caused by severe corruption.
Along with this, we have no consideration and action of our giant neighbors who China, who if the act is really shameless and full of front of us!
But instead of we thank "Uncle Sam" because of his preparedness to stop the bullying of China, we still insist that we should not meddle!
I repeat, we will not agree with other countries, even America, to meddle with the heart problem or issue of our country, but it is one of the people of America to stop China's bullying of us.
Because even if we admit it or not, the painful truth can come and we can be considered an excuse to the giant country China!
And instead of stopping the fight, why would we not thank the defending of Uncle Sam?
"That's what's difficult with the character of a few groups or lawmakers so that we can just say that we have lawyers, but, we do not want to admit that in this situation, we need to admit to this situation.
Instead of squeezing his pride!
