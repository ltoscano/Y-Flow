Be calm, October 23, 2016.
Some of our countrymen did the first declaration of President Rodrigo Duterte to turn away from the economic and military competition between the United States and our country.
The President made the declaration while he is in China for his four-day state visit.
But when the Philippines came back, the President seemed to be giving a lesson when he gave the issue to breakup with the US.

President Duterte explained that on the landing of Davao City International Airport from the state visit in Brunei and China, he has no cut relationship with the Philippines in America and instead, the independent foreign policy he is saying is with the US for the affected.
Any excuse is what the President should do with this new controversy, but only to us, it made a wound, it made a anger towards the ranks of our countrymen who did not agree with what he is fighting in the US.
What happened to us is that before the President will declare our president he has to study it well and consulting on his fellow officials and the Filipino people.
It is not good to listen to a leader who will keep changing the position because it is able to lose trust.
Yes, although he was leading the past election, but this is not the passports to decide when the millions of Filipinos who have put you in position are still needed to be part of the campaign period that's why you won.
But what we know is not included here are some who will greet the future of our fellow countrymen who are in great sea, particularly in the US similar to extending the relationship between the US.
