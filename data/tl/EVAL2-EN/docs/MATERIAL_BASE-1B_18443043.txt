Scrutinize it.

Today, you will test the character of anyone, how will he treat them?

Some who are directly doing nothing for him.

If you want to know the true image of a person, look at how he treat the people who are still low than him, not his strength.

What I feel is a severe depression when I see a person who almost gave up his head and is just being forced to know, but also to those who are in power, and being obedient to those in higher position, but to be proud and obedient to those in higher position, is the best to make sure that your relationship with him will start and correct.

The real Filipino is being treated all the people for the same, with love, and good treatment to anyone, power, livelihood, and your situation in society is the real reason why he is standing in the challenges and taking of abuse.
