There is one story about a family who is rich with a rich family because they are always busy with their job in their business when they go home early and they also go home so they get a helper and also to take care of their child.

In an unexpected coincidence, their business was bankrupted so they sold their big house and transferred to a small house so they were not able to go home early and when I got out of their presence and for her child, my parents realized their presence was more important than wealth.

When they were rich, they lost time for the family; when they lost their wealth, he was considered to be a person who was talking to him by the Lord, he is considered to be his real wealth, he is considered to be one of his wealth, he is considered to be his real wealth, he is considered to be his real wealth, he is considered to be the Lord who wants him to continue in our house.

Being investigated.
