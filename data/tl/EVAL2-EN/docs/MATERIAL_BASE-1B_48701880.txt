The participants of the Blackwater will sit on their campaign in Governor's Cup to start on July 15.
Eric Dawson was asked to sign that it is perfect for them but everyone saw what can be done and given by Dawson when he was still playing on Meralco.
In the other hand, there have been no surprise for them to have a surprise and it can be expected that these congregation can be expected, not just like when they can get a new face with the Elite, and that is when they will get good or not.
When able to pass, it will be fine if you are not good, but will not be ill-tempered!
And it seems that the Blackwater will really have decided that their performance of this season will be good if it happens that they get a good Asian Games.
The Elite was also asked to sign an effective guard who is not strangers in the Filipinos.
It can be recalled that he built a hard time in Gilas Philippines in the past 2015 FIBA Asia Pacific Ocean, where we lost in the team he criticizes.
So, no matter how much it has proven that he will work at the PBA games because, he is facing the cream of the crook in the league., "to those who are in the PBA games, which was the reason why he was able to win in the tight game, then.
If the FIBA Asia tournament which will be used as basis, wow, it might be far from going to a tight water in the Libingan ng mga Bayani.
It is like an sure ball for the Elite to two positions so as long as there are three positions they will cook if they need to take a rest because they need to take a rest for a 48 minutes to be tired.
