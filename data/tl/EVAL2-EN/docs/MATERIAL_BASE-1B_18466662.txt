Suspension of the mayor, which is a TRO by the mayor, Juliet is a TRO for the municipal hall of Cagayan de Oro City Mayor Oscar Moreno.
In spite of this, two months of temporary restraining order (TRO) is almost done against the three months suspension of the Ombudsman because of the simple conduct.
According to Moreno, the Court of Appeals (CA) held their petition against the administrative case that was filed by a boxing gym in the city of CA which could not be submitted by the city council in the city due to his second term as mayor in the city.
They should submit any administrative case before the election on May 9 wherein Moreno allegedly fought for his second term.
However, the CA strengthened the suspension of the two departments of Moreno who are City Budget Secretary Atty. Percy Salazar and City an accountant Atty. Beda Joy Elot.
