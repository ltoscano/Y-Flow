They come home maybe later, we can look at each other; that's why we can look straight; that's why our time is to be deacious; most of our time.
Just like in the afternoon, he / she was still in the afternoon.
When I went to their way home, I know that he / she has money to talk to, he / she already had money that is why he / she was not able to leave our conversation with him, that's why he cannot leave our conversation with him and he will forgive her former boss.
Really.
The rain is playing that is why it is raining there.
It is raining hard, so as if you are riding a tricycle; we are still riding a tricycle; where you are riding it, it's as if you are riding a motorcycle here in the house.
The beauty of the people there is what you know, that we know, that I borrowed a bullet that was borrowed from a road to see you with your companion there.
You are repeating ourselves.
Covetous, deport; later.
