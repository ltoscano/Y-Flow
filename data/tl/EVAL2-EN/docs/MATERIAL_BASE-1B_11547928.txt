Why did they not return to position?
August 18, 2016 - the scene in the municipal hall of Albuera, Leyte wherein Mister Rolando Espinosa Sr., is being dragged to the operation of illegal drugs.
Espinosa went back to the municipal hall of leaving for 15-day after he surfaced in Camp Crame to clean himself after his name and son Kerwin reached the operation of illegal drugs in Visayas Region.
The return of the municipal hall was made by Espinosa because he is probably able to make his life safe, especially since he was removed from his police escorts of the National Police Commission (Napolcom) that's why we did not find the reason for Espinosa to be imprisoned in the municipal hall because his fear and fear in life might be there.
But for us, this is not enough reason for him to be allowed to return to his position as if he is facing no case.
We should remember that Espinosa is involved in a big case but it should not be neglected especially since the campaign of the Duterte government on illegal drugs and other kinds of crime will be neglected.
That's why the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) should do this issue on this issue because we will never hesitate to see the elected officials of the local government in spite of the heavy accusation being involved in the operation of illegal drugs.
We have to think that there is a price hike which should be applied but it is still not enough reason for him to return to position as mayor of Albuera.
This is not a good example to other government officials who are being dragged to the operation of illegal drugs and other kinds of crime.
