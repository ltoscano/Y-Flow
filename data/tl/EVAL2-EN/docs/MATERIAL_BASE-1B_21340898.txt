The Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) Chairman Nur Misuari gives a resolution to the hands of the police and military Chairman Nur Misuari.
This is after President Duterte ordered the soldiers and police to not be touched and let Misuari go out in case he came out of his hole in Jolo, Sulu.
"Thank you, thank you, the Philippine Army and the Philippine Army, let us go with a hidden talent, let it be that if something happened between President Duterte on the 110 year anniversary of the Eastern Mindanao Command, we should not run as leader of the Eastern Mindanao Command, which he became as leader of the Eastern Mindanao Command, which he became the speaker of Eastern Mindanao Command, which is why he became the speaker of Eastern Mindanao Command.
Duterte is also confident that nobody is recognized in the said place but it is important to maintain his proper condition while it is important to maintain a good condition while the government is doing something bad for Misuari, particularly the Bangsamoro (Murray-MILF) and Bangkal (Misuari-MNLF).
Misuari is hiding after the attack of his group in Zamboanga City last September 2013.
