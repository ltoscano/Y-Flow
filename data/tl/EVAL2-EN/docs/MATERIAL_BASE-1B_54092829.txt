Criminals do not feel guilty.

It is clear on the day that the campaign will start for the 2016 presidential elections, and we are in favor of the call of Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago in the town of voters, I mean, voters not to vote the candidates involved in the pork barrel scam.
Of course, we know the call of Senator Miriam that she will start with an agreement with Senator Miriam that the next president should be the next president.
Miriam seems to be saying that we should not vote Bong Revilla to stop the party Lakas ng President and Jinggoy for Vice President Jojo Binay for Vice President Jojo Binay because they are involved in the pork scam.
Miriam is not saying that he should be the president but that is what he wants to find a lot of voters in choosing the right to vote, but there are still a lot of those who don't have the kind to make the senator go to the country.

I fell on a chair when Senator Alan Peter Cayetano said that he is an anti-graft case that he said in his debate with Jinggoy in the Senate and it is said that it is the duty of Senator Cayetano to scrutinize the anomalies like pork barrel "because it is his duty.
Isn't it ashamed of her skin, Cayetano, because his sight is very clean with himself, "Cayetano wants to call himself as the graft case if his hand is not tainted and his hand is tainted.
He is one of the senators who accepted the money that he is hiding from the call "DAP, or bribes from PNoy to crush Renato Corona from the impeachment.
The DAP, in my opinion is a pork barrel that is like the Priority Development Assistance Fund.
He / she said that he / she feels that he is an anti-graft case?
As said by Jinggoy: "What you did in the Senate is that you are full of standing up!" In other words, they are both corrupt, so they should not be clean.
