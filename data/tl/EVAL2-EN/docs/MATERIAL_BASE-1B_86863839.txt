Because I am a person!

Let us not let us remember, that each person is a famous architect of his fate, rather we should just let him be a architect of his personality.

The character of a person can be found in her mistakes because she is used to entertain oneself with his mistakes as a small hobby of her personality, it is not surprising that she is repeatedly mistaken, because this is a ritual for him.

I do not trust a person if I cannot see her mistakes.

Even if I make mistakes, and you fail, it is not coming from the burst of my feelings or to be a good experience, to give me a lesson so that I can give me a lesson to be ready, in case this kind of scene will happen again.

Life is what we were able to teach to our mistakes why we are not pleased by others, but also to our quality and success because if the mango tree is fruitful, it is being thrown away by the foolishness and opportunists.

Many will be happy and will become an ally like you if you are your own mistakes and failure, you should just show on your own parents and family, you should also show up to others that you are used to you.

The person is extraordinary and there are only a few people that you can weigh the mistakes of others when he does not know any mistake or anything that he does not know, experience or involvement in their mistakes instead of your desire to be good in the eyes of others.

Until a hammer, as a hammer, all of the things that you see can be taken away from you and blame others because of your negligence, harassment and abuse of others except to look at the mirror, and watch himself to change.

The thing that is really hard to do is, but it is really surprising, to avoid being perfect and start to make it true to yourself, "because for each other, there is only a person," because for each other, you have a strong reaction if you get thin.
