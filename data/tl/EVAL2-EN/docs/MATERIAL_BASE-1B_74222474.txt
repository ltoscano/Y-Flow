Just a chase.

If it will be examined well, it seems that almost all agencies of the government are in a hurry to make a project, especially in Metro Manila, the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA).
The people of Malaca√±ang said, because President Aquino is ordered to be easily pissed off because his term is almost over and he is worried that his term is almost done and he is worried that his term is almost done, but the scheme that he will be impeached to Chief Justice Renato Corona.
In the cabinet meeting, it is obvious that Noynoy got mad at his personnel, so he immediately ordered his personnel to do all the projects, especially in infrastructures, and one of these is the skyway 3 which will start in Manila and Makati City which will start to Manila and Makati City.
The question, will they be able to finish them inside a very long time?
Just like the news coming out about the DOTC 80th of the new tram of the MRT and LRT, where this issue has already exploded before from the IeCard system which aims to ask for an excuse or "status" which costs $30 million and some officials of the government.
This is the LTO, who is under the DOTC, in a hurry to release a plate number of vehicles that is why almost 2 years, when the bus is so useless in giving franchise to the Public Utility Transportation and this last, the LTFRB and the LTFRB will still stop in the bus operators because of the lack of franchise.
It is okay to rush the government in their place, but hopefully they will not bet on the quality of the project to avoid accidents.
