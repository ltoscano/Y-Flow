The promise July 28, 2016 is fulfilled.
Even if the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) is not in a set budget, President Rodrigo Duterte is persistent to give the promised additional wage to the police and soldiers.
That is why next month, August, the police and soldiers will feel the promise of additional wages for the employees of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and Philippine National Police (PNP).
However, President Duterte did not say how much is the first increase in the salary that will be implemented except for assurance that this will be double, just like his first promise, in the order of President Duterte, he is now being offered to fulfill his promises during the campaign period.
First are the selling of illegal drugs and those behind its operation, as well as the problems that bring illness and inconvenience to the public.
So as early as now, we want the government of Duterte to review that even just a month in power, the promises of the people will be fulfilled.
Because of this, it is just right to pay attention and proper service to those who will benefit from this additional wages because it is clear that there is really no fund for this but it needs to make a way as fulfilling the promise of President Duterte.
That is why our call to the police and soldiers should not be disappointed with the welfare of the public and most of all, give attention to the welfare of the public because your ranks of the first given importance by the Duterte administration.
