It will be the decision of FM to focus on August 14 at August 14, 2016.
The position of Rebolusyunaryong Alyansang Makabayan in the legislative chamber is hard to continue to set up the remains of former President Ferdinand Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani.
Alyansang Makabayan again appealed to ACT, representative Antonio Tinio to think thoroughly about the decision.
"We also apologized to President Rodrigo Duterte that he will push through with his decision, that it seems that he will continue to move on what he mentioned in his SONA, that he needs to move on for the burial of Marcos in the burial at the Libingan ng mga Bayani, and instead of moving on the burial of Marcos in the burial at Libingan ng mga Bayani, he said that it will remain a while to take on this wound.
The group of members of President Duterte also clarified that they do not agree with the burial of Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani.
"Like that, we still haven't given up the position that we have not given up, because this is really just a discussion and wrong with his masculinity, what is really right in history and condemn the wrong," he added.
