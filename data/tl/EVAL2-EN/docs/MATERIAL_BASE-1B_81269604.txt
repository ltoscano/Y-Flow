Truth to this is what the President of Samar is saying, I mean, the Philippines, PNoy, is now in spite of their failure when typhoon Yolanda hit the country.
This past Saturday, my students almost cried when it was released by a documentary about the song along with Yolanda.
They did this before they talked about their education in my class.
What they did was good because it is proof that every Filipino should not care about the said tragedy.
When their report was finished, the discussion was brought about by PNoy to avoid Tacloban City due to anger at their point although they were not from there.
The decision of PNoy is really surprising because there is nothing wrong with what happened to Samar because it was also destroyed by Yolanda but for a president, only a moment ago in Tacloban City, "that is if he wants to!
But this is not done by Toout, I mean that the party of PNoy will be wrapped in controversy since the party of PNoy was immediately wrapped with controversy because there was still a failure!
One year after the tragedy, the passengers are still politicking.
Some of the activities of PNoy to strengthen even their hope in the election 2016.
Like this, the people, Leyte, the Liberal Party (LP) that there is it, it is up to the clan of Petilla but with his own posture in Tacloban City which is not an accomplice of PNoy.
The party of PNoy is expecting that people in Tacloban City will get angry with Romualdez in their town, the LP will go back to their town.
One Direction members have been hit! Samar, Leyte, especially in Tacloban City, is also hit especially in Tacloban City, not even his shadow in Tacloban City.
