Budget the Filipino.

I believe in the preparation of the NDRRMC to help the citizens during the time of calamity.
It is also beneficial for the hour of releasing the Philippine Attach√© and Hacademic, Geometry when Aallonza-Services Program (PAGASA).
A good result of our being prepared for calamities that usually go through our country is good.
It is just right, because we know that more or more than two typhoons go through our country every year.
According also to some study, the typhoon will have a strong strength that will come as a result of what we are calling for.
The question is, is the budget enough for their preparation.
If the storm has the strength of the storm, the preparation of the preparation should also be approved.
How?
Our lawmaker knows how big is what is needed so that the preparations will be bigger and we know how much is missing in the case if we are not ready.
We should not care about it, our countrymen, because it depends on the expenses of the government for serving our future.
Do we want to step down the crime?
The police should be held properly, in training, for additional weapons against criminals and additional budget for the court to correct crimes involving those corrupt.
The budget is important for all the actions of a progressive community.
If we want a proper transportation, there is a need to waste.
If we want a progressive business, there is a need to create enough electricity.
As they say, we need to sail at a good and progressive day and the issue for a safe and happy Filipino is for a safe and happy Filipino.
That is why every time the people's spending is being discussed, we should think that it would be good for everyone.
But we should also not take advantage on where our money is brought, where it is being spent and if it is being spent.

Sibol, Atty. Ariel Enrile.
