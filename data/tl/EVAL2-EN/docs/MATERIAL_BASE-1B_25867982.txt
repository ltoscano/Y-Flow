Mhmmmp!

We are against the issue of Metro Manila.
The water raised our fishermen at Bajo de Masinloc.
Mister President Noynoy Aquino, maybe you want to act according to the posture of you as a leader of the Filipino and Republic of the Philippines, you can be irritating then you have no concrete decision and right action to solve the worsening of China in our territory.
Because you, because you are not like that, the Chinese in us are not like that, if you do not have to be charged with their boat, it is not that the situation of our fishermen now is not that good, but that is already past.
You will be called to Taqueban, they are from China, and their money from China is already there, which is why their money is already there from the ordinary buyers in their malls, Preso, Calies and Divisoria!
They can talk to the leadership of China, especially now that their problem with the economy of Very Cruz is a big problem, it is going to explode in their sudden wealth because you know that, G. Aquino.
The score of the Chinese government is going to go to the Chinese government.
One more thing, you should stop your sign of faith in the government of America to stop the repeated which they are going to help, that will be given by America in time of lack of cellular phones, it is not true, Noynoy.
The American government has a traitor, read the history of the Philippines from America that they have done, we will be cooked and used to all of these for all of these.
What is happening now is not a joke now that I believe in resolving the diplomacy of China's problem.
Even if China is getting angry every time you show that we are going to help us by America, then they will be given a war in our sea. We Are that the reflection of the ship in our sea.
