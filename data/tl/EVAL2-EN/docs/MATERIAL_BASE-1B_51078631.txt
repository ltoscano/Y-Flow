Fight the prostitution.

The problem of prostitution is one of the oldest dilemmas of society.
So my plea is for us to unite against prostitution in any form of it.

Last week, what happened in Subic was a big news to me, if there is no prostitution, this is not going to happen.
That's why I wonder why the attention of the protest is focused on the agreement of the Philippines and America and not the root of the problem.

It is not common to us that the root of the problem and prostitution is not the reason why the arrival of the military is not the reason because it can also happen even if it could possibly happen even if there were civilians who won the US Navy.
Do you think the crime will happen if there is no prostitution happening here?

Prostitution is a heinous profession.
This is a bigger problem if you will think that a man is working and spent to change his gender just to stroll in a prostitute.
It is not right to think about this kind of trend according to my opinion.

That's why it is not right that we will tell the agreement between our country and to a country, or not the situation of our society, to make the reason that there is prostitution in our country.
What we should fight is prostitution is not the agreement of the state.
