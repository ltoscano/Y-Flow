China and the Philippines - strong and creative.

China is aggressive in the move by the island within the West Philippine Sea.
According to an analyst or analyst, China is rushed to the construction of the airlines and military installation of this island because the next president of the Philippines will be aggressive and cannot be executed.
Even if the next president will be more aggressive is it too late because China has already discussed the beach head and a big war will happen if the Philippines will go to the Philippines in this island.
Our government is saying that our country is weak and poor, and we cannot fight back in case the territory that China is claiming will increase.
We are asking for help from the United Nations, but the UN is a member of the United States, to the United States, Russia, Japan, Britain and China.
Who are our allies in the UN?
It seems that one of the four of them does not want to fight with China.
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) does not want to take sides of the Philippines because they also want to claim their islands.
No one can help us but to yourself, but if our government himself will be deceived by our fight against China, how can we support our fight?
We do not want to fight Malaysia in the issue of Sabah and our government does not want to fight Malaysia in the issue of the Spratly Islands.
But we take together in Malaysia in the case of Mindanao sub-state.
Only one year and we might have a new president who can take head-on to China, even if it is just each other.
But you are still hoping that one of the candidates for President is to avoid, to avoid the issue of Chinese flirting in the West Philippine Sea.
