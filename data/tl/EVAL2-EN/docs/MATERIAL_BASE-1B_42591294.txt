Hopefully, we won't be hit by Ebola.

What the government and his family were doing is good in relation to the threat of Ebola.
The government strictly enforced the rules against the Ebola in exchange of any contact between feuding families and families of them while they were wearing with personal utensils in their arrival at their arrival.
From the drivers of the drivers that they rode to Caballo Island in the ocean of Cavite, where they will conduct a 21-day quarantine until they will conduct a supply in these only through the in-laws.
The family did not insist to meet with the soldiers and it is enough for them to feel happiness from the income of their loved ones.
They also did not insist to go closer to other opportunity for those who were possessed, and this was enough for them to see their arrival.
Discipline and understanding.
You will help a lot of discipline, understanding, obedience to rules and other things against the illness of Ebola.
This is what we have seen when the accomplices arrived.
If everyone will hold on this principle, we will help each other, even in the government, to stop the pain in the country.
But the citizens have a clear condition.
"It's as if everyone knows the illness of Ebola... that someone will die... someone will die, that is why the person who lived with a person will die.
This is probably the primary reason why all are following the regulations which are planned by the government and this good condition.
It also means that if there is an Ebola virus, we can expect a severe reaction and this will be exported for the authorities to take action immediately.
He is very kind.
Everyone should continue their awake spirit and awareness about the Ebola virus.
It is the responsibility of the media to give attention to the needs of the citizens for immediate information about the illness.
The media should be 24 hours ready to give information to the citizens about Ebola for appropriate action.
