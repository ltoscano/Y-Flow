Action and reaction.

It is in their actions and not with their ideas that people will meet.

Each thing that is happening in life is starting a action and at the end of one reaction, if there is a reason or cause, there will also be an end of anything, there will also be an end of anything that will not die if everyone has a start and has an end.

Plants have become stupid, or later they are entering and die after the rain, there is a young man or a young lady, married, or a grandfather or grandmother, with a grandfather or grandmother, with a grandfather or grandmother.
Change.

Our duties will follow this kind of respect, we are interested in different aspect, but if you continue to suffer, you will reach you and sometimes, you will reach the top of this law, because if there is perseverance, there is food, that if there is perseverance, there is food.

If you get the success and you are able to get what you want, most are happy and smart, but when there are no doubt, not contented and ill-tempered, even if the sun will not be avoided, it will not be avoided for each other and this is based on your actions.
