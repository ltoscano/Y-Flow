Are you okay?

A lawmaker spoke in the session at a Plenary Hall and condemned what the BIR wants as well as the small people, or "marginalized" businessmen, who need to be registered to the BIR.
This means, they will formally report their income to the BIR, and formally will pay appropriate taxes.
The anger of the lawmaker in the BIR cannot be determined, the small, he said, that there is no ability to provide for the daily expenses.
The example of "marginalized," according to the BIR wants to pay taxes are farmers, fishermen, tricycle drivers and their operators, and similar to others.
They said, they should file charges for mayor's permits and there will be a receipt.
Just think that the mayor's permits can be at P9,000, in print media, it is at P2,500 and the notary document is 100 pesos each other.
In a small work that is earning no more than one hundred thousand in the whole year, the bills that the BIR asked for is very serious, it is very painful in their pocket and suffering to small things.
What is painful is, according to the lawmaker, just when they have written the lack of big businesses in paying proper taxes.
But why did they not pay attention to the BIR only?
Why do they still need to prevent poor people who are working even after the amount of documents are proven to be proven by the tax seals. "They will be proven because their income is small.
They will have a hard time to pay the process when they are weak because of the severe income.
We are not forcing everything to pay taxes, the government needs it.
But the absence of tax exempts for taxes is like there is no use and spending only for the "marginalized. Of our countrymen.
We will not allow the ability of the BIR but their new order should be looked again.
