Jojo should be Agawan already.

Salas or Agawan had been elected by Vice President of the United States under the US President Richard Nixon, but in 1973, Agawan will resign from Vice President after he was charged with a charge of give.
He said he will receive bribe from a construction companies in the State of Maryland when he is still working as the governor because there are no more talk, there are no more words, he resigned immediately.
If Agaton allegedly fought for the case against him in court, perhaps, he was acquitted because there was no direct respect for himself and to the citizens of the US, that is why, instead, he will resign from his position as vice president, he will resign immediately.
Vice President Jojo Binay should imitate the act of Agenda in order not to send his post to his position to give the evidence against him and his term as mayor of Makati.
Based on this point, there will be other issues against Binay that are related to Binay's being a president of Boy Solo of the Philippines, there are already many anomalies in Pag-IBIG Fund where he is a Chairman.
I hope that Binay will wake up to the truth that it's not everyday.
