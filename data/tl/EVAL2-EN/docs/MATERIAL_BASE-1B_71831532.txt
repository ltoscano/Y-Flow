The happiness of America is back to joy.

There is a big possibility that President Benigno Aquino III has a big possibility when he was still studying in America for bullying, using powerful United States, what he wants to happen to the countries that should be allies because they are both from the province.
It seems that he wants to get revenge on those who are criticizing her when his current state is using his current state that should fix our countrymen and we should not fight so that the level of our economy will continue.
We are going to be able to get away from the happiness (under the country in 1991 when the US Embassy in the country will be taken away but because of the sake of the agreement between America and the Philippines, the non-ranking American soldier is weak.
Isn't it that what happened to the toll fee is because of the military exercise, isn't it that some Filipina who have been victimized by being weak from the contents of a few decades?
A few Amboy was not able to know their father after leaving their mother?
Didn't the government have their own home that America does not pay their damage to the natural resources of the country?
In the agreement entered by President Aquino and Barack Obama, who will benefit more?
Will China not be able to get any ally "in the super power?" Is it still natural for the Filipinos to cheat on him when he ran for President when he ran to the country especially the economy.
What President Aquino should do is that he will be charged by the US on the destroyed Revilleza and it is going to fix it so that the Filipinos believe that his goal is good in entering the agreement when Obama visited the country, but for sure, he still does not believe his goal aside from his followers.
