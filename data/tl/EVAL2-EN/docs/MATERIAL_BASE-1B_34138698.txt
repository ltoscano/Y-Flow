Estrella Street.

By Tomas, Santos - January 29, 2016.

Aida have closed his eyes to the heavens.
They were able to save their dreams before.
On the speed of colorful lungs.
A result, a sample.
The child was peeping.
He whispered.
And the moment he called,
Glanced at the record.
Especially in the year of coming.
Save, study well.
A little bit more.
It is free from party horns.
Like the promise that was revealed now.
Only hanger was taken by the gunpowder.
He is tired.
And whispered to the record.
