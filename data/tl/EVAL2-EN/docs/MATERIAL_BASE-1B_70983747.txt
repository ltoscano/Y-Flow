Aside from this, there is no direct disease on the head of TV 5.

It has been almost five years after the administration of the businessman Manny Pacquiao and MVP is currently the third TV station in the country, just a few steps, he does not have to take away from the successive financial loss in the past years.
"As said by MVP, he is already feeling the slowly improvement of their program that would be put up by some of their programs that can be seen by two big stations as GST 7 and ABS-CBN 2 in the Middle East which is always being watched over by more than 2 million of our countrymen there.
But what is wrapped with the headache of the bosses in TV 5 is the highest-paid gift of like "stars that have already been tainted by a cheater" by "Mega Star" Sharon Cuneta.
Just think, it is almost more than a billion peso gift of Shawie's toll fee in TV 5 when his stars are no longer exported because the viewers are not telling his program.
What's painful is that, who else will have a big gift of NLEX, he is still unemployed which is why his program is often affected, which is why even now he is "Mega Star," he is still a Mega Star "."
"He added, what is his use if he also does not have to pay for the income that he has received, he received a lot of money worth of morality (TF)?
Shawie, huh!
