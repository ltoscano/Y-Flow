Discipline the stubborn motorists on August 6, 2016.
The Department of Transportation (DOT) Secretary Arthur Tugade stated that it is estimated that the broken bag of cars which are cut off through the roads in Metro Manila will be sentenced.
Those who are asking the DOTr is due to the repeated operation of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), together with some agencies of the government for the illegal parked cars.
The Transportation secretary believes that the transfer of the box office will help in a distant place to fear the motorists, which is why the Transportation secretary also insisted that it might lead to the interest of many motorists and commuters.
We support the transfer of the low pressure area of armed vehicles in a far place or outside Metro Manila to discipline the motorists who have no fear in expressing their vehicles in prohibited laws.
This step is really a punishment because the transfer of Tarlac to a low area of the drivers that serves as a burden to their fellowmen using the streets is considered an additional punishment.
Aside from far away, the owner will be able to face a huge expenses because the vehicles that will not be able to get it in their central Office and be transferred to Tarlac, and one of the pay are the ones they will make and toll fee.
The transfer of Tarlac to the said area has a heavy punishment, but the question is the cruel order of Transportation Secretary on the stubbornness of the motorists?
That is what we should wait for in the moment that this new policy will be implemented and let us also wait for the good results of the flow of traffic in Metro Manila.
