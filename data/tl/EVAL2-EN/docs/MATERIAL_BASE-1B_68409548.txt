Trillanes, he is really fooled!

Vice President Jejomar Binay retreated from the scheduled debate against his alleged paid critics, Senator Sonny Trillanes, Binay is still the challenge.
The camp of Binay's camp is proud when he went out his lawyer so he decided to back down from the fight which has been waiting for the camp of the Satan, I mean, Senator.
It is also like before, Trillanes was the first in Oakwood and then in Manila Film Festival, it was good that he turned out of light up until the last breath, and then that was where the bag was done.
Our colleagues in the media were extremely tired when Trillanes got angry because there was still a chance that we were covered with fear because it seems that they are just pretending to pursue that bag!
Is it effective for Trillanes to be effective against the antique Binay when it comes to politicking and it is still on the way that Binay is on the way back from Batangas?
I felt pity for Trillanes because it is still early for politics, that he / she was able to make that right away from politics, that is why she was unlucky that it might be unlucky for a day when she was wearing a little bit.
How about that, Caidic does not like to respond to the bait by the three eggs like what he did not return to the Blue Ribbon Committee, as they did not return to the Blue Ribbon Committee.
It would be that for me, that the Blue Ribbon Sub-Committee is going to go back at the hands of the Blue Ribbon Sub-Committee.
Binay is now avoiding only one to avoid being moved and locked in different places in the Philippines while others are running out in implementing said investigation.
If I am Trillanes and even Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, I can stop Binay, already known as the elderly, that the voters will increase because of the extreme heat, it is fine!
