Think, "when there is time, BE is Juny, October 11, 2016.
I was riding a motorcycle in a day, I was wondering why he suddenly slowed down, I thought what was the reason why he was holding the steering wheel from his left hand, holding a motorcycle with his cellphone and was very texting.
I had been able to make a motorcycle riding a motorcycle but she probably saw that someone following him / her so she stood up and I noticed that he stopped before continuing to text.
Do you also do this?
Think also, when there is time!
One more thing that I grew up in my head is when I can hear two motorcycles when he was drunk, I had a cousin who got hurt because of this, he was only fetched by his friend to go out and good time on the road when they got into an accident.
My cousin died after seeing him alive but he was paralyzed now.
Do not ride a motorcycle when you drink, leave the key of the motorcycle and set it on night in the area where you are drinking. "It is better to go to, instead you have an accident on the road.
