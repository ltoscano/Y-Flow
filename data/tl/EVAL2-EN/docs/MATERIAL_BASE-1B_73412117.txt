Afraid?

Janet Lim-Napoles said, why are the legislators in his list if they do not have any fault.
It became the content of the said list of Napoles since he requested Secretary Leila de Lima by the Department of Justice to be a state witness to him about the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) scam where he is considered as a leader.
He said he still has a list of those involved in said issue or scandal.
There are many who got mad at this statement of Napoles, there are also a lot of 'version which led to the accused to release and reveal his said list.
That is why the answer of Napoles should not be scared.
But the challenge of some, is the issue here or just like in Christmas season, and for sure, this problem will be solved and so that all people are just waiting for the things that Napoles wants to say.
He is very famous but in the long time that time has been discussed, there is still no clear direction.
The bad effect of the alleged destruction of said list was being experienced by the lawmakers and even those who have no fault are not able to move on.
For example, I have an acquaintance who is always included in those said to be involved but not.
My acquaintance cannot do anything but wait, I hope that those who are guilty in the country will be revealed and the reputation of the innocent people is clean.
Isn't it that this is also the call of Congressman Ronaldo Zamora, Minority Leader and congressman of San Juan - all of them have doubts.
In the words of Zamora - he / she was very angry with the Pambansang Kamao.
Until the given list was not released, all are suspects and it is not good for the country.
Many are happy that Napoles is fed up and slowly being linked to their conspiring government but it is also not good that such a long time comes.
Release the list to end this issue.
