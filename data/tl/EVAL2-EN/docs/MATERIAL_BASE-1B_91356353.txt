Gladys, ready to leave the MTRCB BE is ready to leave the MTRCB BE.
We were able to talk with Gladys Reyes in MTRCB Office and we noticed that they are already preparing to leave.
We can also look at the office of Chairman Toto Villareal.
We asked if Atty. Villareal will leave, we still do not hear any one who will replace the MTRCB Chairman, Gladys, because he accepted the administration to change, he will change the cabinet and chairman of all government officials.
Along with the change of chairman, he will change his board member like Gladys.
Gladys is not known if he will leave or change it because Malacañang has no advice to them.
We were worried about some of the people from the industry, they have no news that someone said the one who will replace is a good actor who is close to Pres. Duterte.
We also have other names, like a known actress / director because it is strong in Malacañang.
But all the speculation is that.
We were able to talk about it once, "Mother lily Montecy, and all praises for Chairman Toto, what we heard from Chairman Toto.
It could not be replaced by the current MTRCB Chair because of his very clear goal.
"If you were able to go to their office, well, they really do their job," Mother lily said.
One of the MTRCB also said, a big shoes will wear the new MTRCB Chairman in case because of the many cases of Atty. Villareal.
That is why the most wish of the majority is for the same time, do not change the current MTRCB Chairman because he is doing his job.
Gotoc said, until there is no advice from them from the office of Pres. Duterte, their work in MTRCB will continue.
