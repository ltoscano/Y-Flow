DOC-Ass would not be known for the Palace BE, Tina Mendoza July 30, 2016.
Malacañang clarified that the two senators are still continuing to study and it is not yet final the Constitutional Commission (Con-Ass) the way to be done in the Saligang Batas of the Constitution.
In a press conference, Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said that whatever decision is going to be used for the changes in the Constitution, the country can be assured that the country will strengthen and not the interest of the lawmakers.
House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez said President Duterte wants the Con-Ass to be the only one to spend on it.

It also gathered criticisms where the UN experts said.

Despillo Aquino, that it is not proper to make the basis for charter change.
The said step is sacred, and the budget should not be the one to decide on what is the right way.
On the part of Malacañang, Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno also defended against President Duterte.
Diokno said, the primary reason is not the primary reason why the president is favoring the Con-Ass but the real reason why he wants to repair the process and immediately implement the federal government.
"If we do not have a problem, if we can do it, it's because we can handle the Saligang Batas of the Constitution, and it is just right that the Saligang Batas of the Constitution has to change, and it is right that President is in a hurry to change," says Diokno.
Diokno also said that if Con-Ass would be the way to do, he can almost do anything because the lawmakers are the ones who will implement the Constitution compared to the Constitutional Convention (Con-Con), that there are many who need to pay, staff and the rent of the building aside from the said control when it will be finished.
In the barking of Diokno, 1 billion will be spent if the Con-Ass would take a year.
