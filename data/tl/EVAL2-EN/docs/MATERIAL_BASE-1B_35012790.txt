Head wound is what we need.

What is happening in our country is too much.
The corruption in the government doubled up all transactions, before giving and approved, you need to get carried away.
Our policemen in the precinct, when you asked for help, do not make a move when illegal drugs are done, "when the criminals believe, even drugs, throw on them!
The projects of the mayor, governor, congressmen, senators, senators and cabinet members have reconciled.
That's why our country, instead of driving backwards because of corrupt and corrupt officials of the government!
So I thought of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
Yes, in the situation of the Philippines today, we need a Marcos so that the soft president will no longer stand for us, and it is as if the actor leader is not allowed.
Who do we think of what we should vote in 2016, like Marcos who has a hand-in-law?
