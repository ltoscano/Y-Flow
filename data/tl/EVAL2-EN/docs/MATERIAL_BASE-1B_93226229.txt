Garbage!

It has become a habit of our Filipinos to meet the New Year full of happiness and hope that we hope that a prosperous life will change at the New Year with many of us that will no longer taste, and take care of their bodies.
But the truth is, it is hard to remove these bad people if they will not be accompanied by discipline, and it looks like when it comes to the word "discipline," many of us have been hit by fireworks.
They already told them not to be fired, they were still firing their heads because there are no discipline.
A sample, tons of garbage were left by our countrymen who were met by the New Year in Rizal Park, Manila.

Before Christmas, it was Christmas.
Meanwhile, we were surprised at Barangay Pasong Tamo, QC, knocking on those waiting for the garbage to hang out of trash, and merry Christmas, "at the same time with no contents.
Before the year ends, of course, of course.
You will give money to glancing at your garbage and it is difficult to reach or in front of the house, now that the Christmas and New Year will be over, they do not want to collect garbage to the children of tofu!

We recently came from Tacloban City and other places in Samar and Leyte which were destroyed by typhoon Yolanda for them to provide aid to the victims' mission of National Press Club (NPC) against the leadership of President Benny Antiqua.
We still do not see any change and recovery of said places as well as the people there, if not for the help of one kind, those affected are dead from hunger.
We proved that President Aquino is rotten and like him, his officials are also rotten in not moving in Tacloban.
I thought that the local government is also a victim of rotten politics, but they are also included in the rotten politics in Tacloban with a huge help for the NPC for some barangays but was used in politicking and doing a politician.
This is done by his personnel who are worse than garbage from garbage to change!
