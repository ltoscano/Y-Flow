Economy of the Philippines!

Congratulations!

It is not only the popularity of President Noynoy Aquino to be able to say the controversy caused by PDAF and DAP because we can see the problem in lack of electricity supply in the country, which is needed to be prepared for all especially the government.
It is just surprising why it is only now shown by the government especially more than the energy of the electricity when we are sure that the problem is lacking in the supply of electricity that they have long known and we are sure that they have seen it in the time of former energy Sec. Rene Alamping.
It is a severe punishment for this to be a punishment to the economy of the country with "Mamondiong," in the life and life of every Filipino.
If the said problem on the electricity will not be solved according to Valenzuela City Congressman Sherwin Gatchalian, it is clear that the master "economic growth" will be clear and will build a new state of state.
As of now, it is clear in the whole world that the economy of the Philippines is clear and we are still calling the government to go well in Asia but if it does not get out for the government and PDAF, it is certain that we will return again to more poverty.
It is clear that the mentioned problem is a result of the lack of arrest, plan for the past and current leadership in the supply of electricity.
We are lacking in this aspect of preparation and just an analysis of those possible to happen, which is why this is the result of lack of cheating of the government.
Of course, if there is no supply of electricity, the production of our company is affected and this is where the citizens will complain because their working ones will surely be lessened.
The people tasted the solution of PNoy in the crisis in the crisis and that is what is anticipated in his SONA on Monday because the citizens are already tired of the DAP that we know is already tired and just waiting for a few of ALNAs Windyhill, Alvin Feliciano.
