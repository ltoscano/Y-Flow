The enemies of the citizens are trying to get tired of their ability to conduct a mass with the armed forces of the 9th Infantry Philippine Army in the barangay hall which should have been done by the armed forces of the military and police for the third district, which should have been buried in the third district, which was eventually declared that there is still another part of the province.

The mass was tried for the mass to be served as a good and pro-god for more than eight thousand hectares of land in the town of Aroroy, but in fact, on the back of the holiness of the farmers, which resulted to the land of sweat and blood.

This is the face of the Oplan Galugad conducted in Masbate.

If the lives and livelihood of the citizens are in danger of course, the Jose Rapid Command of the citizens, let us not agree to fight back and destroy our rights in life and livelihood, and to kill our rights in life and livelihood.

Jose Rapisora, is also calling for the sake of the government budget for the governor until the barangay captain, to stand up on the side of the people and do not allow the advise of the AFP-PNP for the mass to push through the opportunist interests of the AFP-PNP.

It is never expected that the mass will make the corruption in the corruption of the UV Express mining Corporation and their lawyers of the AFP-PNP, and the progress of the province will not be achieved by corruption, only the citizens, who are the real progressive countries, and only the people, which are the real nation or wealth of the country.
