My problem is about my neck, this is painful every time I dyed me and when I am breathing, I wonder why this is what I feel?
Like other parts of the body, the neck might be damaged because we often move it but what makes it pass is not last for it.

It is missing after a few hours or everyday it is not dangerous because it is not dangerous due to the illness of the neck which is usually caused by a heavy depression or bag or bag that can be bought in the middle of the shoulder and neck which can cause a bait.
That is also the effect of a lot or moving using a lot or a little pillow, his neck can also hurt after it fell or fell.
If this happens, it will only be enlightened with its cause, the bait will be lost after a few days and there is no need to go to the doctor.
Put an ice cream or ice in the neck for 15 to three times a day, take a shower or have it set for enrichment.
The burden that's being observed will also be good for the bait, it is also good for the bait that will be put up in front of the side on the side of computers, especially when you are seated in front of the computer the whole day Keymart Camarillo, and the computer should be on the eye level.
Go to the doctor if your bait lasted or more painful, thank you, See a doctor if the pain in the arm or leg, you have a fever (a a sign of infection) or not control.
