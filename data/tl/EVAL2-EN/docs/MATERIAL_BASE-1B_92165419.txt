Albuera was covered with fear in the return of Mayor By Betchai Oil August 20, 2016 when Chief Superintendent Jovie Espenido, chief of Albuera Police, was implicated in the return of Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr., who was implicated in illegal drugs because it caused severe fear to the people.
Espenido said, the police followed the process of the mayor but it was the work of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) to capture the suspension of Espinosa.
According to Espenido, in the return of Mayor Espinosa, the situation in the municipal hall will not be normal because even the vice mayor of Albuera is not able to show up to the town hall because of fear.
Espenido also stated that Mayor Espinosa did not go home to their houses and instead of his office in Albuera Municipal Hall, he was staying at his office in Albuera Municipal Hall.
