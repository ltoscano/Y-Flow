You are not a burden.

In this morning when you wake up, do you ask this: What is the meaning of life?

Let us speed up these questions: What are the meaningful thing to do, what do we want to avoid, if we are short of things, strength, and how we want it to be done, it is very simple, and sweating, whatever things you want to carry or sweating?

What are these?

A 1-minded people will not change or they will be stolen.

2, the path is gone but punished the self-saving.

3 to escape the truth and blame others why he was wrong and failed in the task.

4 times a waste of things without meaning and benefits.

5-year-old, forced to believe others to believe and make its own system.

6 to an illusion that the eye is dwindling, the eyes are dwindling and of their minds.

7-workers, pointing at first, and opened his eyes to others that he / she became fond of and attitude.

8-years of admiration, rape, and endorsement of others compared to himself.

9 are the negligence and hope to lessen the knowledge and skills.

10 years to be in the end, if it's only for show, it's just a show that others are insisting on it.

11 - a dream of continuing dreams and problems that continue to be changed.

12 years of attitude to hang out, and with no dizziness.

13 years of belief that is not justifiable, selfish and has no concern for us.

All of these are just happening if you do not have love, faith and trust to yourself, if you do not have love for yourself, if you do not have love for yourself, you will not be able to love others.

You will give you no love, but you cannot be able to love if you do not give you anything.
