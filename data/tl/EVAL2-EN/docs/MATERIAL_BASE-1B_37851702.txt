TIDs.

(Lk, 6: 20 to 26)

Let's move.

At the clock, there are rich people living in the hospital who are rich and poor when they got sick in the hospital, but when the poor were sick, they could not be brought to the hospital, because of lack of wealth, they were not brought to the hospital, and instead they are hoping to be brought to the hospital, and instead they are hoping to be brought to the helicopter to be brought to the hospital.

But one day, the government released health center in the area of you and there is a doctor who visits them and caused trouble to the people there.

Who will be more happy with that change, the rich that can be treated in expensive hospitals, those who have no ability to bring the doctor to their sick?

"Tuwid na" or "Mapait na" will not be an advice or advise for us to be poor; and if we want to reach the kingdom of God, we need to be poor anymore and this is not what we want to reach the kingdom of God.

The "Beatriz Street is a direct information or a person.

So we can understand this and we need to give attention to the second part of each "Mapait na"

The kingdom of God is given to you.

He will burn.

Thank you very much.

You have a big reward that is in God.

This is the reason for being lucky.

Jesus does not want to suffer from poverty even if she does not want to have a lot of blessing from the kingdom of God whom she stated is the promise that everything will have joy because there is no one in need.

He also warned the mind and food stall so as not to be poor anymore now, the kingdom of Christ said that this is the reason why the kingdom of Christ said that this is the reason why the kingdom of Christ said that he needs to give to those who are in poverty.

That is why when we do this things, we can say that we are just living the kingdom of God.

In the kingdom of God, there is no Anzon!
