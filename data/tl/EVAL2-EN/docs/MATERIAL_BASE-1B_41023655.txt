Sacrifice of men and women.

Ginger Taba name of Father Edwards B.

February already, this is the month of the heart and love, this is also the month of the light of Jesus -- the feast of the light of Jesus -- the feast of the water that we are asking for us to guide us in traveling.
Let us give a depth of the importance of men and women in service to the church built by Jesus "said by Pablo:" The women who have no wife are things about the Lord because she wants to take care of himself from the Lord. "
They are the priests and nuns who made to get sick in order to serve the church built by Jesus on top of Bato, San Pedro, together with the principles of those who are ready to serve the church to serve, they know that when Pablo has said in his letter to the people of Corstopped.
That's why I don't expect that there are priests and nuns that their promised will be done after many years of studying and preparation, they know that before going to the school of the priest and nuns, they know that before going to the school of the priest and nuns, they know that before entering into a Catholic Church, they should be ready!
Dt 18: 15 to 20; you Saliling, 1Cor7: 32, 35, and Mark 1: 21 years old.
