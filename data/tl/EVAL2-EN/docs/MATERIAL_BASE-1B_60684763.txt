Sen. Pimentel, look at what you did?
Bailagutan, September 16, 2016, the worry of Senator Alan Peter Cayetano is already happening with the anticipated reform by President Rodrigo Duterte particularly on the fight against illegal drugs.
First of all, the party of President Rodrigo Duterte to the PDP-Laban, Senator Koko Pimentel, is said to be the winner of the Senate President.
We know all that happened why Pimentel got the leadership of the Senate and this is through getting allies from the opposing parties of President Duterte.

They were promised that the former president who became addicted to senators and most of them are from the Liberal Party (LP) of the committee, and included here is Senator Leila de Lima that he is investigating the extrajudicial killings (EJK).
In the investigation of the EJK, the said target was the one who didn't want to let go from the obscenity happening because of illegal drugs.
But in the course of the investigation of the Senate in destroying President Duterte, he defeated President Duterte.
That is why I am extremely regret on what is happening because instead of giving the Duterte government focus on the changes that will push forward.
That's why if we take each other on the controversies that are confusing now by President Duterte, it appears that Senator Pimentel does not care of whatever the government government does.
If Senator Alan and Senator Koko Pimentel and Senator Koko "did not talk properly, the government of Duterte has no headache to the reforms that they want to implement, especially the campaign against illegal drugs and the crimes happening in the country.
President Duterte became a hypocrite because he did not meddle with the issue of choosing the leader of the Senate but, because of the course of the incident, I was sure that he did not meddle in choosing their time, especially PNP Chief Ronald dela Rosa, especially since the beginning, it was not proven.
