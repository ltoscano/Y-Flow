No.

Critics complained about the slow action of the administration for the $30 million budget scandal in the MRT 3 project.
If in the thing, why is it that the administration will not put himself in shame to send a foreign companies, allies of the administration who are involved in controversy.
Just recently, Czech Republic Electric Supnad and proven that the $30 million will be received by the group of MRT General Manager Al Vitangcol III in exchange of the supply of 48 wagons for the MRT 3.
The staff of Vitangcol was identified as Wilson de Vera, member of the Liberal Party, is the one who could give clarity on the issue of attempted to be charged with the anti-Illegal Drugs Group.
According to Navotas Representative Toby Tiangco, since he filed the resolution on July 24, 2013, they only took two hearing in the said issue.
The third hearing is not yet, according to him, the chairman of the House Committee on Good Government and public Accountability.
Tiangco has doubts, Pampanga Representative Oscar Rodriguez, chairman of the committee and member of the Liberal Party (LP), is the slow action of the investigation.
Until now, they still feel like when the third hearing occurred when they can set a hearing even if the session in the legislative chamber is set.

If they are not allies of the scandal, he keeps on talking to de Lima when he came from going to face and talk in front of the camera of the media, as if he is sure that he is guilty in a accused being investigated.
Because of PNoy's allies now is being dragged, "the dead issue," what he wants to happen so that there is no noise in the legislative chamber, "the strategy is already dead so that there will be no discussion.
The question: What kind of investigation is what the NBI did?
