Christian ID: Reflection of 2nd Avenue of Lent year-A - March 16, 2014 - the year of the Century.

According to a text message that I received: "No bait, NO's ID, we should also be able to face the glory of God, but after that we want to be able to face the glory of God, we should not be able to face the glory of God," we want us to be able to enter the door of the heavens, "what we want to enter the door of the heavens," what we want to enter the door of the heavens, "what we want to enter the door of the heavens," what we want to enter the door of the heavens, "what we want to enter the door of the heavens," what we want to enter the door of the heavens, "what we want to enter the door of the heavens," what we want to enter the door of the heavens, "what we want to enter the door of the heavens?"
