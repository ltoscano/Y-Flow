We will leave.

Are you okay?

The UN said the UN is the one who left their positions on the boundary of Syria and went to the side of Israel on Monday.
Isn't it that this is the situation of the Filipino soldiers who are assigned to position, but instead of surrendering and shot them, they should not leave and fight back because of what they did, they were even forced to leave and fought back because of what they did.
What can the general say that, now that there are no American soldiers on the side of Syria, they are going to leave if it is not a bad situation if the Filipinos have surrendered?
So what is the difference between the escape of the Filipino soldiers, because of the departure from their own positions of other soldiers from other countries?
If this is the same policy of the UN about the anomalous transactions, maybe they do not have any use, they should study the rules on top of the poor rebels, what are their use?
