Together in the fight.
October 28, 2016 - President Rodrigo Duterte appealed to the Congress to resolve the problem faced by the country in illegal drugs.
President Digong admits that it can't last solve the serious problem on illegal drugs of the Philippines so he asked for the help of the Congress.
Duterte said that the respective agency submitted to him the final list of personalities involved in illegal drugs but he did not know how he could find a solution because the president showed the humility that he cannot resolve the problem.
Even though the President has not asked for a long time for the support of the Congress, it is not too late because the lawmakers of the President will still cooperate with this problem on illegal drugs who could hide for a long time and was exposed under the leadership of PDU 30.
We agree with what the President did to ask for help from the Congress.
We hope for the success of their helping to solve the problem on illegal drugs which is really a big threat to the future of the next generation.
Most of all, this is not just the fight of President Duterte but this is against each Filipino people, so it is just right to give support to the leaders of our government, not only all of the Congress but all of us.
