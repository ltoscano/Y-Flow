To those who are fighting for the funds of the country.

The Philippine National Police (PNP) spent an estimation of P130,000 pesos for the speed up of Janet Lim-Napoles, the brains of the P10 billion pork barrel scam.

The money was used for the rent for an ultrasound, which was used by Missus Napoles, which he wanted at first was in St. Less, but instead, in PNP General Hospital he was brought last Wednesday.

Some senators like Senator Antonio Trillanes and Chiz Escudero who said that Napoles should be transferred to ordinary jail with various criminals.

First, although the woman has an important witness to the said scam, he is not fully utilized in order to speed up those who have committed corruption in the funds of the country.

There is no nutritious evidence and statement given by Napoles, which is why he should not be put in danger of his life, that is why he should not be jailed in Santa Rosa, Laguna where his guards are already separated from the PNP aside from salary.

If in Sta. Rosa, what is being spent by the government is still different when he is being traveled at the hearing about the scam, and here, it is an additional expense in a check up to him in the hospital.

For a Filipino who is having a hard time to eat three times a day and die of disease because it cannot be given to a doctor, disgusting things for the government.

To ask for help from the government in asking for medication, will experience a few days, week, and sometimes it was only wasted by a small amount of help for many poor families in squatters, then it was only wasted by a small amount of assistance for many poor families in squatters.

It is really a big difference, that is why others say, it is good to rob the funds of the country.
