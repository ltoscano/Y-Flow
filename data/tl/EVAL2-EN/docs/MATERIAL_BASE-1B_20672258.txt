Non-raising him.
By between Dacer August 26, 2016 everybody wants to stop the Philippine National Police (PNP) to stop the illegal drugs in our country.
Aside from continuing the anti-illegal drug operations, the leadership of the PNP is also focused on the performance of the chief of police of different police in our country if they are able to respond to the campaign of the government against illegal drugs.
Those who have no ability Chief of Police (COP) to fight the problem on illegal drugs in their jurisdiction is to remove them from position in fact, it seems that the PNP will implement a manual voting in the Bicol Region.
According to the report, it is said that up to more than 20 pesos in the Bicol Region are in danger to be removed from their position because of the shortcomings of anti-drug campaign.
The cases of COP is those who did not let a good performance when it comes to the operation against illegal drugs and shortcomings in the program of the PNP in Oplan Tokhang, who are on top of those involved in illegal drugs.
We salute those who are all corrupt and PNP, the chief of every station or police who should be responsible for their jurisdiction.
If there is a sensible district or precinct, it means that the leader has a K-law, but if there is no ability to stop the problem on illegal drugs, there is no need to stop from position because this may still be a part of widening the operation of the syndicate of illegal drugs.
My suggestion is why PNP Chief Ronald dela Rosa should not make the performance of the rating of the chief of police in the whole country so that it will immediately be determined who should lead and replace more deserving to lead and replace.
This is also effective to feel the strong support in the drug campaign of the current administration.
