It is amazing.

Representative Toby Tiangco is right in saying that it is as if Senator Alan Peter Cayetano and two other senators are going to make a sound, "I mean, why did they suddenly cut the wealth of Vice President Jejomar Binay and his fellow UNA official who is JV Bautista in the hearing of their committee last week?
Still not contented with the mouth of the two allies of VP Binay, what is lacking is that there will also be someone with Tiangco and Bautista outside the Senate that is why when he is drunk in power, Cayetano and the two more "egg" who are with him.
It is clear that there is political agenda to bring Binay a number 1 presidential candidate in 2016.
If Tiangco and Bautista went to the last hearing of the Senate Blue Ribbon, Cayetano invited the hearing on Oct. 8 for all the allies of Binay to speak in front of them.
But what happened to the invitation of Cayetano?
If the committee just listened to what Tiangco and Bautista wanted to say, "hopefully they found out that the two were given by Binay to talk to him, but because Cayetano got scared of what could happen to Tiangco and Bautista about the public, they did not talk about the two.
The Senate Proseso Alcala's things that they are using Binay is already its peak when they will not stand in court even if the Senate will not stand in court even if those who are involved in scandal have not yet been investigated.
Damn!
The novels of Rizal are right in what is happening in the Senate.
If you are rivals with the opposition like Binay, you cannot say yes to you, but if you take advantage of the anomaly, Noli Me Tangere or "you should not be swayed by you.
