Mar-Poe is being cooked by the LP.

Aksyon Ngayon "by Al G. this is an action.

There is a speculation that DILG Sec. Mar Roxas can file a speculation as well as DILG Sec. Mar Roxas on the cases filed by the Liberal Party when it is set to be replaced, "President Aquino said Senator Grace Poe.
Because why would he look for the president of "chicken" outside the party if he still supports Roxas?, and of course, he said that he knows before the said dialogue with the senator will happen.
As a matter of fact, Poe is not the only one to talk to the party but also the other personalities who won as an alternative leader, "it means that Roxas gave the speculations that he will not be a fervent prayer standard bearer the party.
Even Caloocan Representative Edgar Egay Erice is in a very kind-tempered and spokesman of the party, Mar Roxas also said that Mar Roxas still has no different chicken for the presidency in 2016.
But why is there a need to look for an alternative?
In my opinion, it is possible that this action of the Liberal is for the country to be charged and know if there is still a strong experience from the public opinion on radio, television and social media, and based on the comments on public opinions on radio, television and social media, they are saying that this is still a bad experience through the vice president first of candidates who have good ability and experience.

According to the political analyst, the popularity of Poe and "sure winner" if he run for vice president is invaluable, "if he run for vice president.
"That's why the kind of the party being targeted by the party is the adversary, Poe-Poe, which is why Roxas's joke is the joke when he face the public, he is saying" Mar Po is my name. "
But will Grace Poe allow to be a second term for any presidential bet? It appears that while the days are passing, the number of presidential candidates is increasing and just a second year before the anticipated election goes by!
