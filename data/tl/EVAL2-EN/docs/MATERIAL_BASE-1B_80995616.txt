Don't take advantage!

Do not take the call of President Aquino to wear a yellow as cooperation with him about the Disbursement Acceleration Program or DAP.
Communications Sec. Sonny Coloma said recently.
It means, "do not believe PNoy.
PNoy is just making us laugh?
If you think about it, it has long been a saying that if bald people really love to joke.
"Don't take it seriously.

President Aquino criticized because he goes to those affected by typhoon "Glenda" which destroyed it.
Malacanang admitted that PNoy is just in "Midnight Cabinet" in the height of "Glenda."
Critics said, maybe PNoy is dreaming that his trust will increase in two consecutive wins.

After you have been hit by the rating, I expected that the president will go with them.
We still hope that he will take action after she is embarrassed.

But Coloma said, PNoy is coordinating with the leaders of agencies that have something to do when there is a typhoon, like DILG and DSWD.
What does he do in his house?
Who are roaming around, don't make people call there?

Senator Alan Peter Cayetano went to Tacloban.
And do you know what he did?
They are looking for the projects that was being implemented by DAP.
It's because Cayetano heard PNoy that he has money from DAP that was released to help typhoon Yolanda.
Cayetano is looking for money from DAP that they have forgotten that a big part was thrown by the President.
Ayalin, the DAP illegal fund which hit him in his pocket is prohibited.
If there is no sharp mind, maybe he would just call.
As a campaign period, it was exposed.

Senator TG Guingona believes that President Aquino will not be impeached about the illegal acts of DAP.
Guingona was impressed by what he said.
Well, is it the same for the P44-million DAP.
It is the child of tofu! It's in the corner of Ns.
