Cooperation and cooperation.

Are you okay?

President Noynoy Aquino is in Japan for a day of visit because they agreed with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the whole region, and aside from the promise that they will follow the security of the region, and aside from the promise that they will follow the traffic in Asia, that is why they do not need to follow the conflict, that is why they are not going to follow the conflict, which is why they are going to start the conflict, which is also in the status of the Philippines.
Japan is one of the allies of the country that is also one of the countries with the big trade in Japan now that their relationship with Japan will become better, which they promised to go to Japan, which they have promised to be different from the seven decades of the past.
This is what is happening in spite of another bad encounter between China and Vietnam, where a ship of Vietnam were hit by the ship of China in Vietnam, where there was a ship between China in Vietnam, where there was an oil container where China was built, and if that was not being arrogant, I don't know.
No one knows where the self-control of Vietnam through the incidents like this will end, will the UN happen again?
