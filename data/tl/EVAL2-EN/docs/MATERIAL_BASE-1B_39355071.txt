Party-list should it be allowed to separate them?
August 4, 2016.
The support of the plea to suspend the party-list system in the country is growing because of the alleged rape, that will be used by the influential politician in order to enter the Congress.
Aside from President Rodrigo Duterte, the first thing that pushed the party-list group is that there are still many senators and congressmen who depend on the call of the President.
The dissolution of party-list is being planned to be brought with the amendment to the Constitution which is currently being focused on by the Duterte government, for us, should not be careless in this issue.
However, we believe that many party-list are not really member of the sector that they should give a voice in Congress.
It is also true that there are many elected party-list group that came from the same clan of politicians in the country to put all sorts of party-list to increase the forces of the family in politics.
There are some who run in party-list because they won't win as district congressman in spite of the repeated attacks.
But despite all these occasions, the party-list should not be immediately given to the party-list.
What is happening with us is that, instead of stopping the existing party-list system, they strongly implement the rules so that it will not be allowed by the politicians to have a different sector in the Congress.
Along with the implementation of party-list system, it is also very important to resolve the approval of the Commission on Elections (Comelec) is also very important to resolve the approval of the Liberal Party-list group who are fighting.
It is time for all the party-list group to dismiss the fake party-list group to identify the group who have true members of the society.
