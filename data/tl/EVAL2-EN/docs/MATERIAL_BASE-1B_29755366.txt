Mayor Eve back down with the child of Lim?

It seems that nothing happened between the people who were hurt and lost their goods, vendors in Blumentritt in the hands of barangay chairman, said to be strong and young by former Mayor Alfredo Lim.
The vendors of Blumentritt were all crying and trembling with fear of Chairman Rodrigo "Rody" Cruz when they came closer to ask Mayor Joseph Estrada through City Administrator Atty. Simeon Garcia.
Because he does not want to be defeated by his territory, Asiana Salonga is going to take action and he is trying to give justice to the people who are taking the head of sweat.
It was sent to catch Rody Cruz, owner of the funeral parlor in Rizal Avenue in Santa Cruz.
But it seems that what the mayor ordered by Attorney Garcia is severe, that is why even in the barangay hall this morning and funeral parlor in the afternoon, Chairman Cruz cannot be caught and seen.
Maybe that affects those who will arrest, everyone knows that this said chairman is good, which according to those who chose him, he does not know how to write and to the masses.
What is surprising is how will this pass the Commission on Election? "Isn't it allocated for running for the election," he is already able to go back to the election? "May we have been able to investigate this.
In other words, nothing happened to Mayor Estrada's order to catch and face Cruz, why?
The vendors are pitiful because Cruz is threatened to kill Mayor Estrada, who according to the chairman did not have a useless mayor and not as the father of his friend, Roland Lim.
Does this mean that Cruz is proud that Erap cowered with his followers in her?
Wait, what happened to the investigation of the Manila Police District Homicide Section, in relation to Cruz's involvement in the murder of the former chairman in their barangay, Armando Cruz?
Does this have been forgotten or maybe it is already paid?
