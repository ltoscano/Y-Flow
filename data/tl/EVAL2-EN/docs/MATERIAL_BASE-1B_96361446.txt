The eyes of faith: Reflection of the Christmas day of Lent, March 30, 2014 - is the year of the Century.

If the time of Adora is called "Geagony Sunday," I thought that it is a good thing for us to see, "it is a good thing to see our mistakes," that is why we don't want to see the pain in our life, "that is why there are people who chose to see me," this is a good thing for us to see, "it is a good thing for us to see," it is just like the blind eye of a priest, "that is why we still do not have a blind eye to us," it is just like the blind eye of a priest, "that is why we still do not have a blind eye to us," it is just like the blind eye of a priest, "that is why we have no vices in front of our life!" It is just like the blind eye of a priest, "that is why we still don't have a blind eye to us," it is just like the blind eye of a priest, "that is why we still do not have a blind eye to us," it is just like the blind eye of a priest, "that is why we still do not have a blind eye to us," it is just like the blind eye of a priest, "that is why we still do not have a blind eye to us," it is just like the blind eye of a priest, "that is why we still do not have a blind eye to us," it is just like the blind eye of a priest, "that is why we still do not have a blind eye to us," it is just like the blind eye of a priest, "that is why we still do not have a blind eye to us," it is just like the blind eye of a priest, "that is why we still do not have a blind eye to us," it is just like the blind eye of a priest, "that is why we still do not have a blind eye to us," it is just like the blind eye of a priest, "that is why we still do not have a blind eye to us," it is just like the blind eye of a priest, "it is said that we have no vices in front of our life!" It is said that we have no vices in front of our life! "It is just like the blind eye of a priest," that is why we don't want to see the pain in our life! "
