Taking advantage of the tax exemption for 13th day, averted Bay-October 10, 2016.
The chairman of the House Committee on Higher Education admits that they are bad inside their house because of the plan of the Department of Finance (DOC) to remove the tax exemption for 13th Christmas bonus to the workers.
In an interview with Cua, he said that the said law has been utilized for the said law which has been worked hard for the two houses of the Congress to pass the 16th Congress but it will be removed from the 16th Congress.
"It's a bit painful for the congressman, and after we were thrown away," according to Cua.
Under the said law, all workers who are going to receive 13th celebration, which is usually given to the middle of the year or every Christmas, is free for tax.
However, based on the tax that aims to attend the DOC in Congress, this tax will be taken back to those who will be removed from the government if the workers will be lost in the government if the workers who earn $0,000 every year will be taken off.
"Just to see the public that... that there is a correct fight," we will leave it, "we will be lost just like that," according to the lawmaker.
But Cua said that this law is still effective this year or it is still free for the taxes that workers will receive this Christmas because there is still no law that will make it up.
