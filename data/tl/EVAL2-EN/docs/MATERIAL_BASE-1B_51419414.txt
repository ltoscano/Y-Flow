The price of the MRT 3 is planned to be held by MRT 3.

Transportation and Communications Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya plans to suspend the operations of the Metro Rail Transit-3 because of defective railway, according to Abaya, it is necessary to stop the operation to execute the repair of the broken rails.
Abaya has a reason because he is worried about the safety of the passengers that might be in danger when the MRT was derailed because of defective railway, but a lot of passengers are affected if many passengers are affected by the operation.
If there can be a way to fix the rails which does not need to suspend the operation, why is it possible that there will be no change in the rails in the evening - if there is no need to replace the rails in the evening, there might be no need to suspend the operation.
Last week, the trip of MRT has been delayed for two times because of the crack on the railway between Ortigas and Santolan, and it was the same for the entry of Boni Station for the cause to stop the trip of MRT 3-southbound.
The consecutive problems in the MRT are just showing that the MRT were neglected and there is still something done by the MRT in EDSA-Taft Station last August 13, many said that the wagons should have been hit and there might be more bad to happen.
Sometimes, the door of the MRT was open and sometimes the wagons exploded and now, they saw a defect.

There is no more beautiful but there will be a new train in the MRT and make sure that they will fix these, the main companies that will perform to ensure that the passengers are not dangerous to make sure that there will be changes in the MRT.
