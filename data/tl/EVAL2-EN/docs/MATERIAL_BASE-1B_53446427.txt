We should hopefully it's not true.
It was known by September 13, 2016 when the news from Indonesia said that when President Rodrigo Duterte himself said that when he saw President Rodrigo Duterte, he said that he was only a victim of poverty that was why he was forced to commit illegal activities.

Many have expressed their dismay with the Aquino administration during those times because what they did was not enough to help Veloso, that it's good that our country will not be able to escape because there was a new evidence that can be allowed to be hanged.
That's why it is really surprising that this news is coming from Indonesia who said that Duterte did not do anything to stop Veloso's execution, and why is it that before Duterte left, this is what PNoy did, and this is what PNoy did, and this is what we are expecting to do for Veloso.
Now, if all the investigation is done and they have done all the request, Indonesia has already decided to be able to attend Veloso's situation, especially since we themselves are saying that the OFWs are saying that this news will come out from Indonesia.

Hopefully, Duterte and his administration are fighting for Veloso's situation and there are still many OFW who are facing cases in other countries.
