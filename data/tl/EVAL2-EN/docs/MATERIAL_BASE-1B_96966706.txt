We are in heaven!

The news was continued with 80 percent that Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago is very good.
The brave senator is diagnosed with cancer.
He has a rest and now he is already good.
Take a meeting with a meeting and back to normal work, brave and without care.
Senator Miriam said, it is celebrating his body, but his brain is being observed.
I also believe in the said "power of the country."
Which if you think about it, will happen, when I want it to be done.
Nothing is impossible in the things that in your mind you can achieve.
Cancer is severe, so if it is true that the senator's mind is true and she decided that she will recover, it is possible that she would finally get healed.
What is applied at all aspect of life is this attitude.
As said by a famous Master coach, you are the only one who can show up in your life.
If at the start of a trial, you did not want to succeed, it is not far for you to be affected!
I am thinking that every time the people are able to catch up with severe challenges, you are still missing, progress and change towards the beauty of life.
"What our parents often say to us is just in your mind.
Do you fear to go to a challenge in life - fear is just in mind.
Is your feelings out of whatever you're sick - the doubt that you will not get tired of!
I have one acquaintance who went home to the Philippines after a long time living in America.
He tried his family there but did not succeed.
Now he does not have work and starts at the start.
Afraid, angry and weak is the natural feeling.
But if cancer can be defeated by brave and aggressive heart and emotions, is it still a problem for work?
I told my acquaintance, just trust the Lord and yourself.
All good are starting to healthy thinking.
