Allen Dizon once again showed skills in the film security that Direk Joel Lamangan said that Allen had proven that he was one of the loyal security guard who had a serious security guard who had a serious problem with his family.
That's why we will not be surprised if Allen ordered an acting ban here, especially when the security guard in the Kotong-International Film Festival in India is set to be competing at the International Film Festival in Bangladesh Tibagan, November.
Based on what we saw in FB to send his inheritance by Allen Evangelista, everyone is taking care of Allen, one of those who are being admired by Allen Dizon and Ronald Constantino was also included in those who are going to vote, Kuya Mario Bautista and Ronald Constantino was also included in those who are going to vote, Kuya Mario Bautista, Rod Yanglement, Rogelio Liao, Albert Bryan, and many others.
In our interview with Allen, before the start of Premiere night of the said film, it was said that he will bail again now with Director Joel "maybe, it is more fiery when I won at least, but I am more relaxed compared to my craft carrier."
The morgue also added that he did the attack of Director Joel for the characters.
"Direk Wenn said that it is your acting skills here, Trunic, but we want to be an extra drama or acting skills in the social issues but she is not about the security guard as a simple person and about his family."
The security guards are from BG Productions of Miss Baby Panganiban, Romeo Lindaan, and Dennis Padilla, who will be in a gathering an award by Sunshine Dizon, Melai Cantiveros, Rez Cortez who, Raquel Cortez, and many others.
