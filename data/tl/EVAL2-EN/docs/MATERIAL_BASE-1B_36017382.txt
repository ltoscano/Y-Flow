Are you okay?

According to the news today, President Noynoy Aquino said now that he thought for revenge on what he experienced and his whole family under the hands of the dictator, Marcos.
PNoy went to other countries and gather support from businessmen to sail at the Philippines.
It was by chance when September 21-September 21 - the date of the declaration of Marcos of Martial Law has passed, many years ago.
It was not avoided to ask PNoy about Martial Law and he narrated the ghastly weather under the dictator.
PNoy is just a person, maybe others might forget that his feelings are not far from our feelings.
Hurt, worried and sad.
When he said that he wanted revenge for the bad experience they experienced during the time of Marcos, he's just a person.
In the visit of Noynoy in America, he passed through Boston.
In this place, they were last together with his family that they are still complete and not enough.
They lived in the Boston Celtics in America before his father was killed, the hero.
Even his brother Kris said that her happiest year in her life was experienced because in that time, they are complete as family.
As a person, we know what PNoy felt when he visited his former house in Boston, USA.
We can say that she is ill-tempered, she probably thought of their experience there, she remembered her parents who were both dead and remembered the happy day in their house in America.
Political is what he asked PNoy about the declaration of Martial Law and it cannot be avoided that his answer is also political.
But we know that all these events are personal for our president.
On the day of commemoration of the country of Martial Law, PNoy is only a person to remember his personal experiences about this, even better or painful.
