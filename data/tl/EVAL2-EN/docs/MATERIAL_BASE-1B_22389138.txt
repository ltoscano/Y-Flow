The same with the pork barrel.

The investigation of Malacanang is ongoing for those being thrown at the pork barrel scam.
This is what Malacanang said and the DOJ is taking action for this.
King mother, who will believe Malaca√±ang in what he said?
If Malacanang is saying, it will start to three members of the cabinet who are all popular to being involved with the P10 billion Janet Lim-Napoles scam.
The name of Budget Secretary Florencio Abad is reeking, Agriculture Sec. Proceso Alcala and TESDA Director Jonjogging in Villanueva.
But what did Malacanang do?
They are protecting them and declared that they are innocent in the incessant increase.
Abad and Villanueva became congressman and sure that they had a pork barrel.
This is Alcala, the non-government organization of Napoles.
But all of them have been on the same time for Napoles, who benefited from the P10 pork barrel.
Abad was the first one who taught him how to block the pork barrel to ensure that the DBM will release the funds.
Now, Malacanang is saying that the investigation will continue.
There are 12 senators and those who are involved in the scam.
There is a total of 80 individuals involved and 10 of them are involved with Napoles.
All of these were released by the Commission on Audit, the movement of DOJ and COA continues.
But where are these signs?
"The three senators who were still charged by the Ombudsman in the Sandiganbayan just heard the news.
Here is a clear various different kinds of anything done by the Aquino administration, it was very quick to act and take advantage of the evidences, if they are not allies of those who are involved, and they are still guilty.
But if they are allies of those who are involved, like Abad, Alcala and Villanueva and the majority of the 12 senators and 180 congressmen, the Palace immediately declared that they are innocent.
King mother, how to reach the Ombudsman and Sandiganbayan to reach the Ombudsman and Sandiganbayan, in truth, it is not moving to Malacanang?
