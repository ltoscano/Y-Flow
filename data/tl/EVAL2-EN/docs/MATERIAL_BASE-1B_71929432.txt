What is wrong or not?

This is the issue of the truck ban in Manila.
Because from the simple fight of Erap Estrada and the truck operators, this grew up to become the issue of economy.
Because if last week, the exchange of words between Erap and join the truck owner, now the others are playing with each other.
The truck ban for Manila will cause a sample loss for drivers and students, according to Labor Sec. Rosalinda Balangz. Tuazole, $77 million every day, the missing earnings of more than 800 million pesos because of the truck ban.
Starting last week, the ordinance has been implemented which prohibits the trucks to travel to Manila from 5: 00 in the morning up to 9: 00 in the evening.
It has a total of 16 hours or seven hours compared to the old truck ban that has been implemented in Manila.
Aside from Manila, the MMDA has its own or a truck ban for starting 6: 00 in the morning until 10: 00 in the morning until 10: 00 in the morning until 10: 00 in the morning until 10: 00 in the morning until 10: 00 in the morning until 10: 00 in the morning until 10: 00 in the morning until 10: 00 in the morning until 10: 00 in the afternoon.
According to Secretary Baldomz, it is possible that the truck ban will continue to continue being insisted by Mayor Erap.
According to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (Lilia de Lima, the ingredients companies are reported to have been reported to the truck ban for a truck ban, P77 million worth of a text message was missing everyday because the trucks are not able to travel.
Erap's reason is that the new ordinance has been taken to the truck ban - this is to erase the long time problem of traffic in Manila.
Erap has a point, as well as Secretary Balarz and EPZA head de Lima.
But what should be done for the country should prevail in this issue which grew up and became the national issue.
