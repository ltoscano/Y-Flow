It's a problem.

Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago suddenly smoked in anger after hearing the content of the content of the budget from Congress for the year of 2015.
His point is, it is a big fund that can be used for the preparation of the administration of PNoy in the upcoming election 2016.
Let us remember, it was the people! When the Supreme Court started the defense of PNoy, which was the one called by PNoy, which was called a case in the Disbursement Acceleration Program or pork barrel of PNoy.
The truth is that we do not need the interpretation of the Supreme Court about the "savings, because even in the schools, this has already a real meaning or" Universities (Defineness. "
That's why I do not know about it from the tribe of PNoy where they picked up the defense of "savings, while they are from the respected college countries in the country.
Let's go back to Miriam that the senator showed anger in the version of the budget approved by the Congress but the problem is that Miriam is always angry.
Even though it is small or big issue, his fellow politicians are very angry with this style of Miriam, even if I am really used to this style of my favorite senator because he is really the "Bulabog Girl" of the Senate.
The problem is, when the people are used to the style of Miriam, he is just going to go back to this kind of attitude or statement if this is the state of Miriam, let us just ignore the state of PNoy.
We are thinking that the anger of Miriam is too much like what happened in the past issues that after getting angry, there is only nothing else, that is why it is still very difficult, but it is still very difficult, maybe it is very angry that it might be with a pillow!
