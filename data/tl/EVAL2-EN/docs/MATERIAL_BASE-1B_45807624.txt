He said,: The voice of the Lord.
By Arnold Clavio October 30, 201,849, President Rodrigo Duterte is currently taking the voice of God while riding an airplane that will return to the Philippines.
In his story, while everyone was asleep and snoring, he heard the mysterious voice saying "when he did not stop in cursing the airplane!" And when he asked who spoke, "led by Napenas's God!"
That's why since then, according to the President, he will never curse for others, this is a big joke from a person who admitted that he might be an ally ist or not believe in God.
It is a big inconvenience for others or those who are not supporting her to know that he has heard a voice of God, as if she has a problem in thinking, they say.
That is also what became a treatment before to Matan when he brought the Ewar in implementing the land promise or forth when he was doing a big challenge in preparation for the big flood.

They were mocked and called to be crazy.
But for some, this is a special opportunity and privilege same.
This is one thing we are fond of anyone who are allies of the Catholic Church, even the Pope, priests, priests, and others of my faith like me, they are hoping that even once a moment, we will hear and talk to the Lord, in heaven.
To be honest, he is the truth and he is giving me in the exclusive interview of Sergio with Arnold Clavio, Lyacadofficial and even in radio.
It's because I want to ask if everyone knows that what happened is, what will happen is still going to happen, why did they allow it to be harmed even if there are still many who will be harmed and damaged.

Despite this, I did not doubt his decisions.

Despite our plans or what you want, you will feel that he will not forsake us.
That's why it's just right to respect the personal relationship of Duterte in the Lord for those hours.
Hopefully in the next time, the Lord is whispering and worried about his fourth command - don't kill anyone!
