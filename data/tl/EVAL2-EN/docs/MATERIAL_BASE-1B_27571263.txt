You are amazed by the government of Duterte about the first 50-day of duty.
That's why the people are looking for people if the leadership of President Rodrigo Duterte has proven something within 50-day in the side.
In our opinion, if it will be tested, the promised solve the problem on illegal drugs will be tested, we can say that the fight against illegal drugs is going to be tested, which is also the increase in the level of crimes happening in our country, which is also the primary ability to end the Aquino administration.
However, along with the progress of the campaign against illegal drugs, there were many issues and the issue of extrajudicial killings due to non-stop pushing for those involved in the operation of illegal drugs.
The Supreme Court of Information (FOI is going to move forward due to the released executive order regarding this of President Duterte which is very important law to ruin the transactions in the government.
There are projects which have been given to the previous administration who will bring benefits that will bring benefits and it is not impossible to end this because of focusing on this.
So in total, we can say that it is good to present the Duterte administration for more than 50 days from duty.
Because it is past the government for the first 50 days of us, there will be a challenge for the next 50 days to complete the 100-day that is said to be held on Mondays so that the big fishes headed by those involved in illegal drugs will be held accountable.
It is not right to announcement their names but eventually, able to return to any position they are there.
What will be together with the revelation of their participation in the operation of illegal drugs is to make the appropriate evidences in order to pass the case against them and for them to suffer their mistakes in the country.
