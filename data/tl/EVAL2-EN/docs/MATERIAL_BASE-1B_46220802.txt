I am sorry!

The government asked for forgiveness because of the giant traffic enforcer last day.
The people are very angry.
That's why the spokesperson of the President promised to fix the problem as soon as possible.
The problem with traffic is in the mind of many people now, I am sure.
The passengers are worried about the difficulty being experienced in the traffic and the public officials are thinking where the real problem is, and are looking for the right solution.
That is why in our conversation with QC Councilor Toto Medveded, the plan was completed for a "public Transportation Office."
According to Councilor Medalla, even just one day, every day is only one day in a month, it will be called public Transportation Office.
Wherein the public officials were riding the public Transportation to their office and going home to the house.
No matter how kind of public Transport.
"Maybe, you will tell you, ah," for a type. "
Yes, it's really a challenge, it's really a challenge, but it is not just a trend but it will be a trend but to be able to give attention to the agency of the government.
"
And because of this, until the illness of our transportation is not fixed.
I lost the NLEX's toll fee and I saw the traffic problem that has not been solved.
The roads are still on the road, hundreds of trucks, like lined up, are not moving forward.
If there is a public official who is riding one of public vehicles that are caught by traffic in the NLEX last day, "like 3 kilometers per hour, the officials of the government will understand why those who responded to the worsening situation of the traffic can be understood.
If Kon. Toto Medalla said his proposal, many will argue but until we have not tried all the way, we should not stop looking for a solution.
What do you think of my countrymen?

Sibol, Atty. Ariel Enrile.
