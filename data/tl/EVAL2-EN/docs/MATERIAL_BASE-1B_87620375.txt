Until when?

It has been more than half a year since the super typhoon Yolanda devastated but until now, the victims are surprised and seems like a trace of trace.
It can almost be erased from the minds of many about 10,000 people (the Palace) does not want to admit that it died and millions of livelihood disappeared but until now the victims are still being used by some fund.
The help that was not arrived from the poor victims because of those in the territory of President Benigno Aquino III did not want to come from the territory of President Benigno Aquino III who does not want to bring blessing from the victims.
Even the place where the donations are given away, especially from other countries, there will be an argument where it will be built, and who will be the one responsible.
Isn't it that President Noynoy has already deployed on who should be held in fixing the help of the victims?, why is it that until now, the fight will continue and be dizzy from the ears of the President so that he will be dizzy who will be listened to for the delay for help.
Let's just be given away but can't make a way since the help is coming from another country but it is not yet allowed to go to the destination.
If for the people, the administration of President PNoy has no direction but in his personal reason, the Palace should decide just like what is happening in the pork barrel scam. "
That is why it is not difficult to investigate the anomaly instead of giving help to those who need help, the money continue to lead to the investigation and they continue to be an escort to the complaining stomach of the poor.
