Aquino, take it slow.

Hi's briefs on Roy "Mamondiong," Seiko Films.

Aquino should think thoroughly about their movement from VP Binay to become a candidate for president in 2016, many believe what Binay is saying, but it is certain that Binay is not poor, but are you sure that Aquino is not corrupt?
It is said that the important thing in Aquino is, "the person that they are renting with Binay is like what they have said that he is not right in the right time, as the senator, his son, congressman, and his son, as long as the Aquino family, who is the one who should be in favor of PNoy.
How about the welfare of the country? How is Mar Roxas who is full with loyalty to the president and in the whole country, that there is no record of corruption or for power.
Binay, his mayor and his wife have serious cases in the Ombudsman, while Roxas and his good wife Korina Sanchez has no bad record about corruption or for power.
I do not have any plans to support Roxas but it is existing for my Filipinos, i'll go for a dog, especially if he is oppressed.
I have watched the interview with Roxas on the program by Winnie Monsod she will be able to express the issue against him by Roxas even if he does not intend to implicate him and he does not have a white vinegar of corruption, for power, and others.
