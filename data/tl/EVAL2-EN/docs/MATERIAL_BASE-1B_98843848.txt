This is what is happening in the Senate.

IA is hoping that this is what Deputy Director Toby Tiangco said when Senator Peter Cayetano and his two companions in the Blue Ribbon sub-committee complained about the alleged wealth of Vice President Jejomar Binay.
You imagine, while Tiangco and the veteran lawyer Attorney JV Bautista was talking, he suddenly took a glimpse at the hearing of the committee last week.
Is that correct?
Aside from that, they are still not contented with the mouth of the two and they have not enough to carry it with the security guards of the Senate.
In this situation, we can see how he is drunk in power by a person like Cayetano and his two allies.
We can clearly see, my friends, who have political agenda to bring Binay as a number 1 presidential candidate in 2016.
That's why Tiangco and Bautista went there for the last hearing of the Senate Blue Ribbon is because Cayetano himself invited all the allies of Binay to talk in front of them last October 8, but what happened to the Presidential station (SC) of Cayetano?
"There's nothing," there's no word of honor, Cayetano, said Tiangco.
The truth is, the Senate has been exhausted!
Use this things because the demolition of VP Binay is already its peak.
What they are doing is personal because they can't take revenge on the defamation that is why even the deepest part of their life, they are catching up because they have no choice.
