Magpahanggang Wakas, peace in Mindanao!

David D, Angelo.
Peace - Peace Agreement, Mindanao, 1896.

This morning, I was able to read what I am going to read in Rappler), that there will be a chance for the Bangsamoro Basic Law Agreement and hopefully this is the key for the Bangsamoro Basic Law Agreement and hopefully it will be taken away by the Bangsamoro Islamic Liberation Front (the Peace Process (OPAPP) and Rappler).

I know that many are against this agreement like Pareng Nur Misuari and the bitter gourd, Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, but the question is what they did in this time for real peace?

In my service as a member of Pete Taba, I learned that peace is not just one word or fate but this is a way of living, the religions, and Chrisanity, are united with what the most important is peace and love.

When there was a Bangsamoro Basic Law Agreement, I wrote my opinion on this article, "Bangsamoro: Road towards peace." There, my wish is simple to give way to peace.

To those who do not know what this agreement is, we will know the entirety of March 27, where the final agreement is to be signed, but this is not yet done here because there are still a lot of things that they are doing?

Because peace is important to me, you also invited me to be included in his campaign for peace because you will not be united with the campaign for peace maybe you have a t-shirts from the OPAPP) so sealed!
