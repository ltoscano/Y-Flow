San Jose, Occidental Mindoro, September 12 (Pia) - the leaders of the National Food Authority (NFA) met with the leaders of the town of San Jose, Magsaysay, Rizal and Calanoga) in the office of NFA, San Jose recently.

It is the purpose of the said meeting to discuss the reported issue regarding the possible decision of NFA or the removal of the mandate of NFA to buy rice to the farmers due to the financial loss of the agency from P165 billion.

According to NFA Provincial Manager Miguel Tecson, they have two mandate to their office, the first is "Shiro security" or the assurance that there is enough food for the citizens especially during the time of calamity, and the second is the "price hike."

On the second mandate of NFA, he bought the product of the farmers at the amount of P17.5 pesos per kilo of rice in the market. "Its price hike for regular milled rice in the market.

We do not want to sell the regular milled rice for P27, and the P222,278 people, if we will not build its subsidy), "Tecson explained.

He was compared with NFA in the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), the two agencies that they have given "social media," he added are "social service" to the people, which is why NFA should not have been suffering from it.

Meanwhile, some farmers are worried that in case the shopping of NFA will be removed from the amount of P17, there is a big possibility that their product will increase in more than low price.

This means that this is a financial loss and possible fall of the local industry of rice not only in the province if not in the whole country, aside from the letter that they will do, they are ready to go to President Duterte to look at the release of the farmers in case that they will push through, which will be allowed by the farmers in order to push through the removal of the division of NFA.
