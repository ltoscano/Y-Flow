What is the true wealth?

Ginger Thy Walis name of Father Edwards B. Liwag.

According to the book of Examination: "People who are widow and orphans, but here in our country, we were asked by our government to be recognized by the foreigners.
Our countrymen are studying to work in different countries, like in the Middle East, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Japan, and we Filipinos, which are being done by our country, are pitiful, our country is pitiful, and we Filipinos will be protected from the eastern part of the eastern part.
I remember that in the day we are convincing America to become the state of Hawaii and Guam, but we are not in poverty even if we have the ordinary citizens who are in the government and we continue to suffer from politics, those who get rich from the country's funds.
That is why up to now many desires to enter politics from being a president to a councilor, and if they get the chance, there are still many who are going crazy or are going to enter the service of our country.
The true wealth that Jesus has taught is the entirety of love between God and others like our country, the whole order given to God is our real love for the family, my daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law, is a real love?
