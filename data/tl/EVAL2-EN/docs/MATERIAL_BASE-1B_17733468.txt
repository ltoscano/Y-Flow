Opened.

Open (Lk. 7: 35) living in the hot living room, do not talk to him too much and do not talk to you too much.

There are people who are like that, who no matter what you do, they still do not want to accept it because they do not want to accept it, because they do not want to accept it, because they don't want to accept it, because they do not want to accept it from Juan Bautista and she is not able to accept it because they are in fasting and will not accept that they are in fasting and will not accept it.

They also do not want to accept it, Jesus will not accept what they are waiting for the promises of God because he is socializing with the mistakes of God, those who do not know more than them by the experts in the constitution and Production.

The heart and mind that that is what is happening is that, what is happening is that, what is happening is right, it is still expensive to hug to the heart of God if you want to be free from the heat and living in the cold because you want to be free from the heat and living in the cold because you want to be full of love.
