I continued to threaten the "mass."

The "mass was threatened," the Philippine National Police Office (Commission) Association of Incorporated.
The Supreme Court made sure that they will file a Criminal charges for those who are guilty and officials who ordered the operation of their spiritual faith in the history of the PNP.
The retired chief Supt. Tomas Rentoy said, the chairman of the Commission on Elections) said that they are able to show all the Priority Development Assistance Fund) that are now deployed in the field where they will leave for five days as protest.
In the 44 who died, six are the products of the Priority Development Assistance Center, Senior Inspector Rommel Morissette Amon, Senior Inspector Ginger Consignation, Senior Inspector Gedrial, Senior Inspector Gedrial, Senior Inspector Gediting and Senior Inspector John Binalon and Senior Inspector John Garry Erjas.
The feelings of the police became more intense when they heard the statement of President Noynoy Aquino this Wednesday night which seemed to be no action to protect the killed police.
It is said that PNoy's statements were approved.
As said by former President Fidel Ramos, very Commander of Chief of PNoy.
When Vice President Joseph "Erap" Estrada was asked to ask, he said that: "Dont (MILF) all out of war is needed there."
As well as the feelings of the retired 2-star General / ex-Mayor Alfredo Lim: "The government should immediately think that it is not possible for the government to file a warrant of arrest against High School which should have been declared by the police who died, 44."
But it is unlikely to happen that these kinds of ated officials are unlikely to happen, because the government made the armed groups in Mindanao to pass.
Just resign, Mister President!
