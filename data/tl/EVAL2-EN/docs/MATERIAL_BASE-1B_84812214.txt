Last May, 2012, the script of Juan de la Cruz was passed in 2012 Metro Manila Film Festival because it was included in the said project that Maja Salvador, Jake Cuenca, and Albert Martinez), was denied to be in the television series and observed that it became a signal number one in the television series.

It seems that in life, we are given a chance to recover and prove that what's important is that we are not giving up to this the message of Jesus about the shape of a tree when we fall down, then it still has a chance to rise.
