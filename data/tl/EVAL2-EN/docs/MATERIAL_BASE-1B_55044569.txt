I am RL.

The month of March is a sign for many students to finish one year of their struggle in school, but for the teachers, this is a sign of a goal to guide each student in order to be a smart and good citizen.
How much is a teacher, especially in a foreign place such as Bracx in New York?
In my interview with Ma. Teresa Bautista, an American teacher chose to take a risk in America in exchange for six thousand pesos to income, but I seem to have a glimpse of the life and challenges that the teachers are facing like him.
According to Ma. Teresa, his dream was fulfilled when he went to America and given a chance to work as a public school teacher in Bracx.
Despite the objection of his sibling, he went there because of the negative image of Bracx, she still decided to leave the Philippines from the desire to raise the state of his family.
"I accepted the Job Fair even if my brother said, just do not go back to Bracx" that even if there are people who are creations of the area of the area, "I continued," said Teresa.
It was not easy at first for Teresa to get along with the new environment because aside from different culture of Americans in our Filipinos, it is also different when it comes to school.
It almost reached six months when Teresa decided to adjust to the kind of teaching there.
"The children are looking at how they are the ones who always fight each other, so that they can't point that, you cannot point, discipline your discipline," he added.
Teresa also recounted to me that if in our country, the teachers knows how to follow the teachers and have discipline, in America who are different.
"Here in America, it was a different kind, sometimes, they saw each other in teaching.
At the end of our conversation with Teresa, my respect and admiration to the teachers like him has increased his dedication and a long time that they spent to make sure that they should be called modern heroes.
