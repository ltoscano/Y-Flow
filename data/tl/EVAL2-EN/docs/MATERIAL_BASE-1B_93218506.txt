I am not a pro-Binay, Blue Ribbon Committee.

The attack dog of Malaca√±ang and some senators are pushing for a few senators - including some of the allies of the "Ipit Gang" in Facebook.
I posted my opinion on the social site of Facebook recently who is calling for the "investigation of hearing aid of Boation" by the Senate Blue Ribbon Sub-Committee on a simple reason that he does not have a great help and destination for the country and the people.
Well, the followers of being caught on my Facebook account, and it is said that Vice-President Jejomar Binay's allies are worried, and it is said that the media who is easy to pay and easy to pay, will quickly change? "
It is a fool, that is the critics who have been against us and with the coldness of us, we are not pro-Binay but the truth is that what is happening is the deceit of the people of the Blue Ribbon of the Senate that is going out of time, especially in the funds of the country.
It would have been okay if he has given a new hearing aid, but even if he has just given a child, he can see the direction of the Sub committee of TJ Guingona.
PSOHala Bira will call those who were assigned in the investigation by the Senate and not the suspects for an effective crime.
Okay, in the country, you are the ones who say.
The Senate now turned it back then, because I am still studying for a high school to College, instead of playing with my childhood friends, I run to the Congress to listen to the debate with the debate in every issue.
Even if it almost goes to words, I admire them because the result of deliberation is the country and the citizens today, now, they are only three!
