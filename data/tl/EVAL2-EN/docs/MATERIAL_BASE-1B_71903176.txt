Lacson to Trillanes: "If you make sure," By Eridao, September 27, 2016 challenged Senator Panfilo Lacson to Senator Antonio Trillanes IV that make sure that Edgar Motabato is threatened to have credibility and evidence that will match what he is saying.
This is the response of Lacson after Trillanes said that he will wait for his co-senators in the following days, that Matobato is telling the truth and he has credibility as a witness.
Matobato, the self-in Davao Death Squad (DDS) member, who involved President Rodrigo Duterte on the killings that happened in Davao City when it was still the mayor of Davao City, but according to Lacson, he can only say that Trillanes is an implication to what he is saying. "
"If Senator Trillanes can show to us, he said that the person who is going to cross in that place, Senator Trillanes and Senator De Lima, is important, that it is important, that means," according to Lacson.
However, if there is no reason to show the senator, there is no reason for the committee to wait for the investigation to investigate on Matobato because there is also nothing new to say that it is an expert.
Most of the senators are in doubting the testimony of Matobato, because of not equal statements.
