I will investigate on DBP.

MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino was carrying the cocaine in the cocaine in the traslacion of the Black Nazarene this Friday.
It is said that there have been more than 2000 was the conducted by Tolentino, enforcers who is going to attend to our fellow devotees.
Tolentino made the gimmick of crystal meth in diapers because of the lack of toilet or taking advantage of the destruction of toilet, and so they could not leave the delegates to pee or steal.
Many complained that Tolentino was criticized in her gimmick.
According to the critics, the enforcers does not need to leave their "place of alibis as if you want to pee.
What he did is just an exchange of funds for the MMDA.
How much is the value of each animal that resulted in how much they spent for this?
Are all used or wasted?
It should be investigated.
He / she was wearing.
How do they have to put drugs, weapons, and a passenger jeepney that exploded in New Bilibid Prisons (NBP)?
The NBP is too mysterious because the movement of money from the inmates will be clearly seen in order to continue their cruelty.
It was said that drugs was the root of the previous explosion of a grenade in a grenade operation, because they lost income from the explosion.
Isn't it so that they detained her and criminal charges for him to have a wife's lack of freedom? It will be a payment for the crime he did and the biggest punishment to remove his free life.
But the lives of those who are in the streets are worse.
They themselves can still do the crime because this problem is because of the wrong system in prison, all of the leaders are all corrupt.
There is a proposal for the military to give the monitoring of the prisoners in NBP to remove the Bureau of Corrections while they are not fixing the system.
Why won't he try this?
The problems are not in the prisoners but to their guards.
If thieves are also thieves and it looks like the guards do not really happen in our prison.
