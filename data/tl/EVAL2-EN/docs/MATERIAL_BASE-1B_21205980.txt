Day of grieving.

This is not the first time President Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino is owned by the National Day of Maker.
Eight Hong Kong tourist was killed in front of the Quirino Grandstand in Rizal Park last August. 23, 2010, where Noynoy went to the age of 55 years old as the president of the country.
President Noynoy remained silent on the bloody incident but after two days, he was replaced by a National Day of Metat.
Come with t-shirt to the whole country and also in all the embassy and Philippine Consulate.
Like what happened in Rizal Park hostage crisis, Noynoy remained silent in the Maguindanao massacre last January 25, 2015, where 44 Special Action Force (SAF) of the Philippine National Police (PNP) were killed.
The encounter between the SAF and the Moro Islamic Freedom Fighters and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front died but even the PNP officer-in-charge and the chief of Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) did not know why the crisis happened.
Even President Noynoy did not hesitate to speak at the beginning.
The remains of the killed SAF commandos were heading to Villamor Air Base in Pasay City to give military honor but no commander-in-chief said that they will be brought up to 42 years and the two were buried in the AUV town in Zamboanga.
It's because Noynoy was there in a factory of a Mitsubishi Montero and Corporation where he promised that he will help the car companies that he needs to improve his business in the Philippines.
The next day, he went to Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig to grieve with the orphaned and promised to help them.
He / she was also impressed by the Day of Mabalaca like his declaration last 2010, EP / Raul VALNAs.
