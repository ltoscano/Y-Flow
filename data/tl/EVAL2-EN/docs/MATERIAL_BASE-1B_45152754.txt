A parent cannot hide what is feeling that in spite of all sacrifice and difficulty in front.

Our child is a man and he still has no sibling, we already prepared her to be diligent in studying because this is the best weapon for a child because it is better for a child to guide them carefully in his studies and education.

Since he / she was not able to have a hard time with the guidance of her studies, he usually has an honor for his grades in last High School which was why he tried to pass away from his grades.

We only got up for two years and he will take care of what he wants after two years and he decided to finish his abilities because he already knows that he will finish or get the course of a genius race if he is still in favor of him.

At a young age of 17, he will not be able to accept the job of May until October because he will only be 18 years old to have a bit of rest from his continuous study.

In this way, our child is jailed and has no vices like others, but we do not want to feel the importance of being responsible and laundry in the coming days since we do not want him to be forced to get married in the coming days because we do not want him to be forced to get married in an early morning and we do not want him to be forced to get married in the coming days.

The time will come when he will go through his own life, that is why all we are doing is a way for his preparation and this month, on the date of his course, we will witness, we are happy as parents.
