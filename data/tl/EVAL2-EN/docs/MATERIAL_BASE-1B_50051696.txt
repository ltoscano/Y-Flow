We are our father.

Our Day (Lk. 11: 1-4) a child was playing in their house when he went to the kitchen.

He saw a knife he played with him when his father arrived and took him the knife, the child cried.

He said that if the knife did not go back, the father did not return to the knife, but she does not want to get the child, that is why we are still young, that is why what we are saying is that, what we are saying is that what we need is to ask from God.

We are requesting that the heart and goal is to make the true meaning of the kingdom of kingdom.

To avoid temptation that is given to us by God for us to live as his children, but we should remember that what is good to us is for us not directly give but what he gives is better for each other.
