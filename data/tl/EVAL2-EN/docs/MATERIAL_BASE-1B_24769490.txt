Andi's friend, Jake has already known the father of Ellie! By Jun Lalin, September 25, 2016.
The camp of Albie Casi√±o was greatly thankful because the truth that the actor is not the father of Andi Eigenmann, Ellie.
Jake Ejercito, the son of Erap to Laarni Enriquez who is the father of Andi's daughter.
It was Max Eigenmann (sister-sister of Andi, to her father, Mark Gil), told her that it was a national issue that Jake Ejercito, on Thursday night, was like a national issue with Jake and not Albie was the real father of Ellie.
We called the management of Jaclyn Jose (mother of Andi) to take a statement on the prime actress, but Jaclyn is said to be taping she is not sure if she will speak.
Albie was not sure if he will give an official decision, but he posted on her social media account of the truth that he is going to happen.
If it can be remembered, the issue that she was the father of Andi's child was affected by her, that she denied it.
The career of Albie was only able to give importance to the career of Albie when she was given a Second Chance of Dreamlodipine and ABS-CBN million and just include in The Wings of Love, James Reid, Nadine Lustre.
Andi and I called a few well-known friends to ask about this thing. "
The first thing we talked to has refused to comment about the thing he said, and do not involve himself on the issue, especially the intrigues that he hit Albie because of defending Andi.
The second friend of Andi who is also from showbiz was shocked when she did not know that Jake is really the father of Ellie, but he did not tell about it because he does not want to lead to his friend.
He is wondering why it was Max who made a secret even before that they did not know.
