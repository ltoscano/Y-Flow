Separate the National artist.

Instead of giving an honor, the national artist Award caused the unity of our race.
One proof is the removal of honor National artist of Nora Aunor in President Aquino because he is the only one who knows.
Matet de Leon continues to cry when she found out that his mother Nora was removed from the list of those who won this honor.
Matet's feeling is not afraid but angry.
Please do not neglect my mother anymore, "he said.
You have an award but you should not spit on him, "he said.
There are many guess why Noynoy did not like Nora.
Nora is said to be having a relationship with because he has been in a relationship with a lot of times when Noynoy said, and not the passing of it.
Vilma Santos is said to be PRO-Noynoy while Nora is pro-Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.
Noynoy is also angry with Nora because Imee Marcos released the monument for Nora in Ilocos Norte.
Is President Noynoy Aquino?
In order to stop this conflict, it might be better to separate the National Transformation Council of the Philippines, which is better known as the Pambansang Kamao of the Philippines.
This is not good caused by the Filipinos because this brings only a quarrel, from the administration of an award and the president of the republic.
This is just a gimmick of President Ferdinand Marcos in 1972.
Many of those appointed by the national artist did not know the most of the Filipinos.
What's more painful here is the meddling of Gloria Arroyo of who should be chosen as the National artist who just copied Noynoy.
"There is no miracle," Nora said, but the number of miracles was happening in the tear of the National artist Award.
