Are you difficult to Ka Bira?

True tragedy will happen.

Poverty is the poverty of their aspirations.

We have already accepted the poverty if it will not be remedied and you will not make yourself in thinking if there is no action and change for yourself, if you do not take action and change for yourself, that you will change and change the surrounding you for their benefit.

The picture of the suffering that keeps on your mind is bothering you and you are just living with him if your co-workers or neighbors are not affected by what kind of things, if he is poor or not, he is poor or not.

But if someone will ask one of our common countrymen, if he is thinking that he is hard and what he needs in life, he will only answer his situation compared to a person who made her mind, but this is not a reason that even his mind will be felt, "it is also difficult," it is also poor.

Look at a farmer, just a simple life and shallow; he is satisfied with the farm, eating vegetables, fish and rice field, but if he continues to buy vegetables, fish and rice grains, it is only normal to buy food, it is only normal to buy food and become lonely in life.

More than sore and even his soul is also poor.

This is mentioned and good news as a warning: "Do not be swayed by your souls, instead, your hearts will just discover, this is a simple answer," it is difficult for them to change the kingdom of God, "what is difficult," we will understand this statement. "

Even if the situation is difficult but not contented in life, the rich is rich; the rich is rich, the poor is poor.
