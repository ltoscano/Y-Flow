The Black propaganda.

It seems that Caloocan City Mayor Oscar "Malapitan presented the" unable to stop the disdefamation and criticizing his character.
Because since the chaotic world of politics was broken, he was no longer able to take advantage of the allegations being thrown at him.
Like, in more than three decades of public service, it is going to attend to lunch, lunch and dinner is the defamation of enemies in politics.
But the beauty is, Mayor Orca has been used to basis to be carried away by a black propaganda that they are preparing for him because it is clear that the people from Caloocan are continuing to support his ability as public funds.
"Mayor Orca is going to be mayor if he does not love Callejon Dos who have put him as vice mayor, congressman, and now the chief of Caloocan.
Because instead of waking up, he is quiet to promote the programs and projects that he dreamed for the city.
In truth, the Caloocan did not have a city hall which was made to have been done by Mayor Oca.
An example is the monument where it is a place in the city that lepers, but they could not fix it and now the motorists were praising it.
The monument is only one of the many projects that Mayor Orca has done for the first year of his good governance.
Next year, the pending action of the new building of the city will start to be built on a vacant lot in 8th Street, Grace Park.
Mayor Orca plans to build a low sports center which can be used by Calamudi, especially those from the first district.
Many of the mayors dreamed of build a new city hall because the current building of the city has to be cowards.
With the determination shown by Mayor Orca, the construction of the New Caloocan City Hall will surely be fulfilled.
If the new Caloocan City Hall and sports center - it is certain that nothing will happen - Mayor Orca is going to be the zika virus.
Those who are destroying do not really do anything.
