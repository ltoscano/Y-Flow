HIV RL-ERS, QC CUDM.

The case of HIV in the country is worrisome, but the distress is the lack of action of the government against it.
The DOH is only doing all warnings that there is no appropriate way so Filipino HIV will increase.
It is time to have a law that they are strolling and control over things that causes or cause of having illnesses.
There are ordinance or laws in the towns or cities that should rule out, but it is not effective because of many reasons.
For example, Quezon City with a confused ordinance for this thing, but did not keep it properly.
In the report, the QC police is a place in the country who has a big number of HIV chemical, probably because of the "unrespondents.
For fun, like the club and at first, prostitution is part of their business that they are doing.
If the government of Mayor Bistek was active in expressing the truth to those coming out, well it is certain that there is no prostitution.
It is said that no one can stop this task because of the prevailing corruption in the QC government and police.
"The people of the mayor and QC police are not moving forward against prostitution because of the millions worth of the club and at first, operators.
In the club, they were exposed, according to the source of Chona Agaton Bernabe, having sex with the Vizcaya Police District (Very Implementing Rules and Gaming Corporation).
It's so easy to do so that the sex in cision will be stopped, Mayor Bistek was supposed to prohibit the Nueva Vizcaya Philippines.
Same with them, at first, the divides that will be done in a big room to avoid having sex.
"Mayor Bistek was not only one of the act, but also the other mayors in the whole country to control the increase of HIV.
Do not ignore it; the city and town hall should take action, the DOH and the Aquino government against this problem.
