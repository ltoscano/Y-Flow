Tears was the only answer.

Of course, legitimate rights and personalities in social media, Jim Paredes and Leah, did not do anything or to fight Binay or to stop Binay, but if it is true that Binay doesn't do anything or to fight against Binay?

Second, a clear motivation of protest is feared to be president of Binay so that if he will win, it is certain that Binay is still strong in spite of the right defamation to his allies of Aquino.

Are we aware of these kinds of implication in this kind of implication? Or they got ahead of anger and extreme heat of the filipino masses?

Third, why is it that there is no need to support the candidacy of Interior and Local Government Secretary Mar Roxas? Probably, they still don't want it to be charged by those who are supporting other presidentiable, but what they are pretending to be against the traditional politics, and because it is a protest against the politicians, the question: How much?

Fourth, is it really a rally against Binay's candidacy?

The protest happened while the rape and rape of the constitutional solution was reported to the constitutional solution and order given by the foreigners to the land and business, while China is claiming the territory of the Philippines.

While the workers of the burned factory of Kentex were looking for justice, while the command of the Mamasapano, Alan Purisima will be returned to police.

Fifth, 1,000 people are really, based on the pictures and footage of the television, it seems that there is no police to give a bigger number?

Why is there nothing?

At the end, the corruptions of Paredes and Navarro was heard from the depression of the politicians surrounded or saliva for president but it is unlikely to win, and even if they win against Aquino, they fear that they will lose their salary.
