Curfew for curfew "Tina Mendoza July 24, 2016 - Malaca√±ang maintained that there is no need to rise up to the Supreme Court (SC) the issue on the curfew that started to be implemented by some cities and plans to be implemented in the whole country because it is appropriate in the Constitution.
According to Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo, if the opportunity is asking for the opportunity and to ensure the safety of the youth, the local government units (LGUs) should implement curfew.
Panelo admitted that in a few moments, the youth need to go home early, especially if there are projects and in this situation, it is possible for the Supreme Court to ask for curfew for some cities in Metro Manila on the effects of the released City Ordinance Division.
Atty. Jesus Fcila III insisted that the ordinance is the legal counsel of the group, that the ordinance has to decide on the rights of the parents who will be imposed to the youth who will be imposed on the curfew including one to 10 days for the third time.
According to Panelo, it is no longer needed to be taken up to the Supreme Court because it may be asked for protection from the Supreme Court.
It can be remembered that President Rodrigo Duterte said that the curfew will be an effective way to ensure the security of the youth and to avoid them to become victims of criminality.
