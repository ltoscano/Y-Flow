The 119th Independence Day!

Before PNoy sat as President, he was about 7 percent rate in our country.
Because of this coming from the leader and support the good future of our citizens, the number of our countrymen who have no livelihood has increased to 7.5 percent.
Our President is really good, isn't it?
It seems that his promise will come true, if there is no corruption, it is difficult to be poor, so the situation of Filipino workers is very beautiful now.
With the extreme beauty of our workers, many of them almost do not have money to eat because their small income goes to the very expensive price of oil, electricity and other basic commodities.
Sardines and instant noodles as our fellow countrymen usually use the hunger, for almost everyday, increase in price, thank you for the good and intelligence of President Noynoy.
The more thinking of thinking is that PNoy does not notice the real events happening in our country.
He still continues to live in his illusion "Tuwid na Daan" by his government but in real life, he is still a nest of corrupt and evil.
And because PNoy's belief is severe, "if there is no corruption, there is no poor," he insists that corruption is the corruption of his followers in Malacanang.
Isn't it that many of his followers were caught by the pork barrel scam of Janet Napoles, but one of them did not even file a case?
What is good, isn't it?
The more amazed of PNoy is what she is numb about the situation of our media.
Within four years, around 24 years of journalists have been deceived but one of them is not yet given justice.
And instead of going to push for the rights of our journalists to defend themselves, it was even removed through his Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Group.
"Oh, isn't it that PNoy came from?
Idol continues to taste it when it comes to the failure and count it to a useless leader.
Are you impressed by you?
