Discipline and unity.

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) is one of the branches of the government which is important to be done in our country, this is under the management of the Secretary, Ramon JP Paje.
The DENR, is the one making the laws focused on our environment, like our surroundings, mountains, immediate action, the way to cover the entire islands.
The DENR was with the implementation of the laws caused by LGUs and barangay to our citizens, that should be followed by the rules.
Discipline is the first one who should take discipline on your own citizens and you need to start discipline in your house going to the community where we need to start discipline, cleaning the surroundings, cleaning the surroundings and cleaning the order in the surroundings so that the whole family is far from being sick.
There is a need to have a proper attitude, unity and mind the program 3RL-Reducated, just use it and maybe it is only right that we will add up to the improvement of these.
If each one of us will remove the stubbornness and lack of discipline in the way of throwing garbage and if you have a concern for the surroundings, we will surely fix everything that each one should do.
Health is important, and we need to pay attention to all of us have a right to live in the surroundings so that there will be a healthy life and family.
Our country is known in the whole world, because of his beauty and wealth of nature, that's why it is proven to be "Pearl of the Orient Seas."
All mentioned will surely be achieved through the help and pity of the Lord who created it, if we will be united and helping each other.
