What is happening in Manila?

Last Saturday (February 22), I experienced severe traffic problem while I was going to the town proper for the city of Malabon.
Just imagine, in the five kilometer length of Malabon, I caught it for almost three hours because of a tangled traffic.
I first noticed the surge of vehicles from Monumento to the crossroad, so I opened the direction of East Avenue.
Because the place was still traffic, from Caloocan City Hall, I decided to go directly to Mabini Boulevard, but here, I decided to go directly to Mabini Boulevard, but here I was trapped in the number of traveling trucks going to Pier in Manila until the C-3 Road and the entire surroundings are filled up.
I looked for a corner of a corner, but it seems that the trucks are discerned that's why I did not do anything but to lie down.
"I am not really pissed at the severity of traffic but also the drivers and motorists who are stuck in traffic.
If I can handle it, the truck driver's anger is worse and they are blaming the truck ban of Erap in Manila.
"It is not only the drivers and motorists who are affected in the grave of traffic, but the residents of Dilawan, Camanava for the area.
So because of a negative traffic, "the residents did not get out of their destination using their vehicles.
Because of the traffic ban on that, we think, the local government unit who is a neighbor of Manila has a problem.
What is happening in Manila, Mayor Erap?
Plague of machinery.
The residents of Quezon are complaining about the scattered glitter (PERNC and gambling) in the towns of Buenavista, Tagas and Padre Burgos.
They said that the operation of those who are pointing out is exposed that, but the police are not moving to stop them.
