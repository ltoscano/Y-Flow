The former Makati Mayor Junjun Binay went to the request of former Makati Mayor Junjun Binay after he undergone a huge relief for them to travel to America and for his son to be treated "conformity, heart disease."
Binay personally faced with his lawyer in the third Division of the Sandiganbayan where he is facing 6 sachets of graft corruption and 4 sachets of graft charges, wherein he was accused by his father, former Vice President Jejomar Binay and other former officials of the Makati City government.
The accused of the accused is being done when an accused is doing something when the accused of the anti-graft court has a motion to be expected of being talkative on the case he is facing.
