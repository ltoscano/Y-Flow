AOIL or will take a knee in nationwide curfew July 27, 2016.
The Supreme Court issued a Temporary Protection Order (TRO) in the implementation of curfew in some cities of Metro Manila, particularly in Manila, Quezon City and Navotas.
The kidnappers earlier insisted that the curfew for the Constitution has been against the Constitution because it is against RA 9344 or Jumarito.
Before the release of the TRO, Navotas was implementing their ordinance by curfew around 10: 00 in the evening until 10: 00 in the evening until 10: 00 in the evening until around 10: 00 in the morning.
A thorns in the implementation was the order released by the Supreme Court.
But we believe that the government will also have a strong fight towards the fulfilment of curfew to all minors, especially when there are many children who are involved in different crimes while there are other children of bad elements in our society because it's at the late hours of night, they are everywhere in the road.
We also believe that the rights of the youth, especially the minors, but have a limit because many children are becoming stubborn and cannot be guarded by their parents.
So the implementation of curfew will help a lot in order to maintain the houses of minors and stay at any kind of trouble or violence.
That is why it should not be an obstacle for those who are pushing the nationwide curfew for the Supreme Court (SC) but they should also use it to strengthen the fight in order to strengthen the curfew for minors and identify them not against the Constitution.
