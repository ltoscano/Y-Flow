Clay pot.

The thickness of the faces of the owners of the Agriculture Secretary Production Alcala and said administrator of the National Food Authority, Orlan Calayag of the number of embarrassment caused by the two of them to go to President Aquino still cannot do anything to leave their respective positions.
What's more funny is that Calayag of announcement about his resignation from his position as the administrator of NFA but the next thing you know is that he will still wait for the person who will replace him by former Senator Kiko Pangilinan, who was defeated by the president as Shiro security czar.
Well, sir, you do not need to wait for Kiko because you have a deputy administrator who can replace you! "That is a chance that you will be put in position, right?, sir?
Or maybe you are still fixing the documents there in NFA in order to cover-up the foolishness of rice cakes, so that you will contact the rice that is importation of NFA in Vietnam but also the Baruel place.
Meanwhile, Alcala is really close to his position and he did not let go of his position until the President did not say that he still trusts him even if he is full of shame when he brought the administration.
Well, sir, where is the promise that we will have a text message on rice under your service? "Don't you think that you will get an inspiration for the DA secretary?" Are you able to show that under your service, we can achieve the true Food Authority?
It appears that even President Aquino does not believe that he is the reason why he appointed Kiko in his position as Shiro security czar.
Anyway, you feel that your feeling is really weak when your face is really thick, it is really difficult to be tainted with shame.
What's sad is that even their boss, PNoy, he jokes about being twisted.
