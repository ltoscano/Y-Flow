The Editorial Department - if there is the refined!

Yesterday, the six-month suspension of the former Philippine National Police (PNP) Chief Alan Purisima should go back yesterday but he will file a return to Purisima, which is why he used it to be used by Purisima when he used to leave Purisima.
Purisima was suspended by the Office of the Ombudsman last December 2014 because of the anomalous public service that resulted in the Special Action Force (SAF) that resulted to the brutal death of the SAF 44, which resulted to the brutal death of DILG Secretary Mar Roxas and PNP Deputy Director General Leonardo Espina.
Last February 6, 2015, Purisima resigned as PNP Chief but not from service, he is scheduled to retire on November.
Six months before he is retiring in PNP.
If Purisima has the decency, why did he not resign.
