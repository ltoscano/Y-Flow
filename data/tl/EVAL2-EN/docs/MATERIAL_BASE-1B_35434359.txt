President easily touched it.

It seems that the president seemed to go to our president, resigned PNP Chief PNP Alan Purisima and PNP General Getulio Napenas, Jr., suspended at the Special Action Force Director.
The case is, it has been a few weeks when President Noynoy was attacked by Napenas in the jurisdiction of the Mamasapano, which is a misua "in Maguindanao.
Noynoy was immediately suspended by Napenas while Noynoy was hit by Purisima in the burial of Purisima on the bloody fight in Mamasapano.
If one newspapers did not release the meddling of Purisima on his involvement in Operation Exodus and other operations, we will not know that Noynoy, Purisima and Napenas was the one who planned all these.
Noynoy is mad at ex-SAF chief, but he is not angry with Purisima, as he / she is not mad at Purisima, he said to a politician before, Are-Friends that's why the SAF chief of the corridor of power was approved.
Earlier, Napenas was admitted to his living room, which is as if he was a member of the beauty queen to save Noynoy from those who criticized her, like the mastermind of Noynoy Aquino.
Getulio Nape√±as said that he might not stop by PNoy until the SAF General, just take the initiative to talk to, it might be better for him to be alone and whatever happens to her.
Martial law is declared by martial law, but it is unlikely to happen, that is why it is unlikely to happen, that is why the Philippine Police Commission on Napenas was going to investigate and probably will be removed from the presidency and will probably be released by all in benefits and pension.
Secretary Mar Roxas is the leader of the Police Commission on Elections), which is why he wants it to happen?
Or why would he resign?
