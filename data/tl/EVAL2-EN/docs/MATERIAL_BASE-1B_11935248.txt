To Binay?

It seems that the direction of the wind in Malacanang is changing, because many are expecting that President Noynoy Aquino will mention to VP Jojo Binay that he has been together when they were ambushed on 1887 mutiny.
The said statement of PNoy is unusual because it seems that the President is going to the removal of the President because it is clear on the rays of the day that Binay and Aquino really had a relationship.
In other words, the relationship of the two clan will have been long and there it seems that DILG Secretary Mar Roxas is at a disadvantage because it is not that deep in their relationship.
Aside from the long-time relationship, it is clear that each of each of Aquino and Binay is clear so we should not be in so much shock even if Binay is the one who will bring the President in 2016.
Aside from Roxas giving his ambition to become president in 2010, we do not know that PNoy is a deep relationship with PNoy and this is what the Binay is feeling.
It can be recalled that Aquino has history of this kind of attitude after leaving or not endorsing Ramon Mitra Junior in 1992 election and instead of Fidel Ramos who took the Presidential election.
It is clear that the recognition of the debt of gratitude to the Aquino and that is the reason why they carried Ramos because this is one of the questions that happened while the wife of Ninoy was in the palace.
"That's why it is right now that Roxas should keep it well because if they will just go on school, they will probably report on the events especially since PNoy did not mention the secretary of the DILG on his SONA.
The anticipated events in the following days are because if we will turn the tone of the tone of Binay and Cong. Toby Tiangco, spokesperson of the opposition, it can be seen that they have seen the comment on the previous SONA of PNoy.
