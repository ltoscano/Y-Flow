Oplan Tokhang.

Vice President Jejomar Binay is dark and called for people who are dark, Noguavas, of a Filipino carp on the characters of the Aetas.
There is nothing wrong with being dark because the goal of a person to his fellowmen is white.
The only problem of Binay is that he is involved in many accusations of stealing from the public funds.
The name of Jejomar Binay was smiling or with the words Jesus, Jose and Maria who is a picture of the holiness.
There was a joke when Jejomar has given birth there was a joke that he / she looked like a drooling!
Why?
The Aetas or Noguera is a type of poor, not similar to brown, and barbells.
Jojo Binay is saying that he is from the clan of poor people.
"That is the same time, the people who attacks her are saying.
Binay has received billions of pesos since he became mayor of Makati, the hard to believe, his opponents said.
According to VP Binay, the Oplan Tokhang was launched by the rich against a poor like him.
He directly accused Secretary Mar Roxas who defeated Binay last election.
It looks like Binay's sign is the fight for the presidency in the next election is to fight the poor versus rich, and fight the black versus not black.
The fight is like it is not in the issue that Binay and his family will not hear anything from the Blue Ribbon sub-committee of the Senate.
But Binay is not sure of winning the victory because he is only his ally, Harry Roque and Clarita Carlos, aside from Boy Sevidal of the Philippines (BSP) that he is the president for a long time.
We should be observant.
Are Binay really stealing or not?
