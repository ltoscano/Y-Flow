Join Daniel Padilla and get registered to Elections 2016.

Do you allow you to vote?

Well, here is it that there is a length of hair that is why you do not want to get registered which is why Daniel Padilla still wants to go and go to you.

Thank you very much for the National Historical Commission for Alunan, there is a lot of thunder-up (PYuan), COMELEC and Flying Pictures.

Oh, what are you saying, go to the nearest COMELEC Office and get registered!
