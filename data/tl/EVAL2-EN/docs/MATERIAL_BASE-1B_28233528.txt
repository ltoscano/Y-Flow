Change.

Change (LE. 21-29) "the only one who has no change in this world is changing, and even if the God does not change, he does not change and will change his words, and even if the Lord's love does not change, she does not change.

This word is the reason of the love of God to change the history that God has changed to you, so you might think that you have changed your self, you might have changed your feelings towards you, you might not know that you have no problem, that you do not know, that you don't know!
