We can do it: A program for poverty.
According to October 18, 2016, one of the beautiful programs of the current administration is what President Rodrigo Duterte is saying to fight and end the criminals who continue to sell and selling illegal drugs in our country.
In my opinion, this program has been successful in the first 100 days of Duterte because we saw all thousands of drug addict and drug pushers who voluntarily surrender to our police so that our country will continue to be clean that is destroying the future of our youth.
Aside from this, one of the things that I have been waiting for Duterte is his widespread programs to stop the bigger poverty and poverty experienced by many of our countrymen in the time of former President Noynoy Aquino, that many of our youth were able to finish their studies and now they had a good job in order to raise their families from poverty.

Hopefully there will also be a program like the 4Ps, Duterte, to focus on the poverty of our country, the poverty in our country is being discussed, a widespread meeting with different local government, big companies and non-government agencies, to talk and help each other to fight the hunger and poverty.
This is by Vice President Leni Robredo that in the campaign he promised to give attention to those who are behind our society.
It's good that while Duterte is focused on the suppression of criminality in our country, Robredo is focused on the problem of poverty if it will become a good relationship between Duterte and Robredo, not far from the future of our country.
