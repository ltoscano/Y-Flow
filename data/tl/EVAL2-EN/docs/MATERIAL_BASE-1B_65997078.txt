Let us stay in Puerto Princesa.

Hopefully, it is not a joke and "made of the negative stories about the image of tourism in Puerto Princesa.
In the news in the media, the tourism industry will fall down since Mayor Lucilo Bayambang is the chief of the city.
But if we will let the tourists go to tourists, "why would the tourism in this city be stronger.
From July 2013 until January 2014, which was the first administration of Mayor Bayambang, 36,161 that is the tourist in Puerto Princesa.
There is a high "thing compared to abathy 355,85 tourists who arrived in the same six months from July 2012 until January 2013.
And in the seven months of service of Mayor Bayambang, it reached as 11,196 to visit Puerto Princesa.
Because of the very high level of tourists now that happened in the city, "this is a proof that Mayor Bayodo is a great administrator.
The recorded data that was mentioned are proof that the tourism will not worsen but the tourism in the city of Palawan was stronger.
We think, there is something in the back of the negative and "good publicity that damages the beautiful beauty of Puerto Princesa.
That is what we feel that is the root of a black propaganda, this is a clear defamation to the bad news coming out about the place.
There is a recall election that is being cooked against Mayor Bayodo of the opponent in politics who cannot accept the defeat in the previous election.
There was also a crime rate in Puerto Princesa, but it was just an attempt by Mimaropa Regional Police Director C / Supt. Melva.
Because of resentment, these kinds of wrong news will attract the Gdz, do you know who I am referring to?
Let's take a peek at the beauty of the SEA Games because we are in Puerto Princesa.
