The Lord is following.

Tons of tons have been left in the cemetery after all Souls' day, this news is not new anymore.
Garbage is really a problem after two days of November 1 and 2, when a million Filipinos are almost together in the cemetery to visit the cemeteries to visit their departed loved ones.
In our past column, we wrote the preparation for the security of the cemeteries and we saw the effective cooperation of the authorities and the people to ensure the safety of all.
I believe that in the coming All Soul's Day, there can also be a level of solution on the problem of garbage.
If only this will be focused on, like what should be focused on the issue of security and safety.
It is effective if there is a cooperation between everyone and if there is a thorough investigation, the rules and faith in order to reach a goal - in this case, is the proper way of garbage every All Soul's Day.
For example, there should be a lot of trash can be seen in the cemetery and there is an announcement where they can throw the garbage.
If possible, there will be a garbage to look back so the people will not have a reason to throw it on where it is.
The vendors should also have responsibility in their garbage.
I believe that in the proper campaign, Filipinos will heed the order and request, next rules especially for the good of all.
In order to set an announcement and explanation and education.
Just think about the disease spreading about dengue, even those who are feared to die.
All diseases may start in the lack of clean facilities and lack of proper knowledge about cleanliness.
The result of the strengthening of security last All Souls Day is good.
Hopefully in the next year, intensify the orderly and effective management.
