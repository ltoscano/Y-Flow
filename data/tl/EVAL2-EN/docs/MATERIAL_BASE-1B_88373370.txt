Baguiran, on the parts of BE, Bernard Taguba, July 26, 2016; and just like a vote, Ifugao Rep. Teddy and his partner Baguilat and Quezon Representative Danilo Suarez were still in the fight with the leaders of the coast of congress.
This was revealed by Navotas Representative Toby Tiangco in Ozamis City last night, that's why the leadership of the Minority Floor of the Congress, Baguilat and the elected Minority Leader would not be declared.
In the election on the speculations in the legislative chamber yesterday, House Speaker Pantaleon "lady" Alvarez received 251 votes, 8 to Baguiran, while 7 only voted in Suarez.

"If the Rules of the 16th Congress should have been picked up, they should have been picked up by the vice mayor Congressman Baguiran," says Tiangco but this is not done by the leadership of the legislative chamber.
In the latest election, up to 21 congressmen do not vote or have evacuated so it is possible that the Section 8 of the House Committee should be allowed to choose who to choose who among Alvarez, Baguilat and Suarez insisted on what they would support.
