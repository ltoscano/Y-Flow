"What if we have something to do, who are the ones who are stupid; we are the only ones who can let us not allow it.
Who really is that, okay?
In the morning, do not have to fight back at night because we do not have to fight for each other, so that we are going to be fighting for each other.
No matter what time or what I am in the morning, you can watch over my feet no matter what happened, I am still like that, I am still like that.
I am still at five o'clock.
That is why it is coming.
