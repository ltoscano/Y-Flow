Batteries or generic pharmacies and more effective?
August 27, 2016 when the medicine is proven, and its price is expensive and it means that it is more important than the generic medicine?
The generic medicine is a copy of the brand name who has the same age, proper use, effect, side of the administration, Disaster Risk Reduction, safety, and its strength similar to the original drug pusher which will be the same with the remaining drug pusher.
For example, for example the medicine for diabetes, the medicine for diabetes can be exported while it is cheaper than batteries, which is proven to be a number of drug pushers in the law, the generic illegal drugs should be safe and effective medicines like a brand name drugs.
Why are the generic drug addicts?
Cheap, because of this, it does not spend in taking care and opening of medicine.
When a company has a new medicine and will be brought to the market, they are going to spend big when it comes to space, development, unity and promotion of their medicine.
They are given protection, which is given to the company with a high medicine that has been sold so that it can be sold until it is effective.
