Propaganda of Taj Front - NPA-North Abra.
7th of March, 2013.

The Propaganda of Tausug-NPA North Abra has continued violence and violation of human rights to the citizens under the Oplan Galugad conducted from January to February of the current year, that a crazy dog is looking for human rights in the town of Lagrao, and Licuan-Baay in the province of Abra.

The twenty-year-old Mayor mar Alcantara is attempted to kill and beat up the trigger of his eyes while they were trying to leave the trigger of his body, while they were trying to leave his head, but before he left him, he was threatened by his companions, but before he left her, she was threatened to go back to him.

Last January 30, on the other day, the encounter happened between a member of Charlie Coy of 41st IB, and it was hard when they talked to their faces that they were not able to talk to their faces that they were afraid of what really happened to them because they were afraid of what really happened to them because they were afraid of what really happened to them because of the threats of the military.

Although the teenage boy was also a victim of arresting the teenage boy, Jews, Licuan, Abra, and he was brought by the soldiers, who was said to be a civilian, a minor, and his nephew who was the victim of the NPA, was not able to run away from his post.

Not only a few individuals were victims of human rights of 41st IB, under 503rd Marine Brigade and those suspected to be supported by the NPA, as well as those suspected to be supported by the NPA, and those suspected to be supported by the NPA, the things that became a big obstacle in their search for life.

Even in the past there are also many civilians who became victims of illegal arrest, abuse and threats in the time of military operations not only by Charlie Coy of 41st IB, in the time of their operation between Braval-Coy, Barangay Bunga, Lacub and Brgy. Pacgued, Malpas.

It has also become a trend for the soldiers of civilians as guide in their operations even in the combat and military operations by saying that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not just a violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement (Izzy Canillo) but it is clear that this is not a violation

It is also not good to give a year based on the 41st Lieutenant C Coy in spite of the approval of the soldiers in spite of the destruction of human rights and taking advantage not only to the residents of said places, but also in the barracks.

Despite the statement of the AFP, the soldiers are now disciplined, they are already disciplined by many cases about the destruction of the animals, which is why when they have made up, they are going to be transferred by a young lady in Brgy. Mataragan, Malipayon.

Up to words are said to be the public service to the people because they do not have any task to show real service and giving importance to the goodness of the citizens.
The Propaganda of Taqueban, under the victims of violence and domination of the AFP, should not be charged and charged by the anti-American military who should be united and to defend their rights.

Let us join the New Hunan Bayan for the real justice and real peace through the launch of a democratic solution until success.
