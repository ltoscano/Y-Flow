Are you allies of Binay.

It looks like Manila Mayor Erap Estrada's advice to Vice President Jojo Binay is severe.
Imagine, do Erap advise Binay to not face the Senate investigation because only one of the vice president is only one of them.
In our research, it is clear that Binay's rating of the people is clear because he does not want to defend himself from the investigation of the Blue Ribbon Committee of the Senate and that is what Binay wants to face those who are accusing his senator, including Antonio Trillanes, Alan Cayetano and Koko Pimentel.
What the people want is clear and that is what Binay should follow.
He needs to face his former co-workers in Makati and now it seems that he has not helped anything good to them like former vice mayor, Nestor Mercado and Atty. Renato Bondal.
The people are doubting Erap because if the advice of Binay will be analyzed, not to face the senate, it will ruin the political party of vice president because it is clear what the people are saying.
The mind of the public was extremely ashamed because of the use of Erap because the fire was not killed because of her candidacy in 2016 as President of the country.
Erap knows the timing and this is what he is doing to the present because the destruction of Binay to the people is the start of his chance to return to Malacanang.
The discussion on this day will be strict and there is a need for Binay to be critical because his small mistake in the present will possibly be brought with him in the quicksand of his long dream.
For sure there will be more people who want to pretend that is why the vice president should be observant because it is possible that the former president should be observant because it is possible that his companions have already passed away for the money.
