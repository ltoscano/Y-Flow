All your work is a big blessing.

Ginger Thy Walis name of Father Edwards B. Liwag.

We have been telling him again to look and call the Lord and let us turn our backs to Jesus as a preparation for our new life to change and we continue to ask for forgiveness and we continue to ask for forgiveness and we continue to live according to the good outcome of Jesus.
God's great pity is that he is giving us all the time to work or look for our livelihood, we should not allow us to be lazy, let us continue our hard work, we should not allow us to be lazy and continue our dealings with our fellowmen, we should not allow us to become lazy and continue our dealings with us.
From El Centro, California to Arias ona (via I-80), I have been awake and in the eastern part to get the heat of their venom on the rays of the sun when they are hiding in the ground that is why they have no charisma.
Along with our Filipinos, laziness is going to look at the environment and there are still a lot of land that is nothing but in every place of their land there is a lot of plants but they do not waste the small ground that is why there is no one with God.
