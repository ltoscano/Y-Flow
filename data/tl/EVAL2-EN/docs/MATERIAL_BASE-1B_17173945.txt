There are also a lot of evidence.

There was a report released on All Souls' day about the old grave of a government official who made a store.
There is no one taking care, it is still being spent.
It is saddening.
Meanwhile, wherever we go, the celebration of "epal" will be seen in "Halloween."
The gimmick of scary costume is everywhere.
There were even a chase when she was wearing a scary costume.
We know that Halloween will borrow, let us just wait for this gimmick from other countries.
Every time of Halloween, it is time for the Philippines to think that the dead loved ones are worried.
But in other countries, the deceased loved ones are also worried like the soldiers and the heroes who served in their town.
Every All Soul's Day is an example of Arlington and the America is sacred, the ceremony of the deaths of officials of the government is sacred.
They were able to save the ceremony, the ceremony and the mass provided with them by the government because the service they gave to the country is sacred to the government.
Why do we make it like this?
The graves of our heroes here who are not too famous, forgotten, no one is visiting them.
Their tombs "every All Souls' Day is published, not even one candles.
"That is even one of the various stores.
Why should their contribution to the country be given importance?
Because from the study of the past, the new generation of history will learn.
How can we ask our youth to serve our youth a proper service to Iya if we are not stopping the appreciation of the people who showed this kind of service and giving importance to the Philippines.
It should have been a agency of the government that a mandate should be given tribute every All Soul's Day, famous or not, and those who are loyal and the whole heart served in the country.
Let us just wait, imitate their beautiful.
