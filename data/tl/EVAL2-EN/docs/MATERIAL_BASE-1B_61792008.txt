Supporters of Celso Mainza Command-Bagong Hala Bayan-Sorsogon was the bait that the government government needs to spend the planned legalization of the Philippines and the Armed Forces of the Philippines in order to insist on having a disastrous peace talks.

The solution is not our solution with the root of the armed arguments in the province of Sorsogon, or in any province or regions of the entire Philippines, it is just an attempt by this call to gather any kind of interest of the local people who have heard this kind of interest in Sorsogon so that they can raise them through the riches of the province.

Those who violate the peace peace talks in Sorsogon have to understand that the armed arguments between the government to ask for a huge problem with the government of the Philippines and corruption of the government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Needle of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines.

CMC considered a positive step of whoever comes from the side of GRP) for their hard work to cooperate with the vast citizens to push the peace talks in however, CMC, and his provincial administrator, Robert Lee and his provincial administrator, Robert Lee, and discard the idea of a lot in peace talks.
In relation to this, AFP Public Affairs Office Chief Lieutenant Colonel Ramon Zabala also said that the previous agreement between the government and the NDFP members should be studied and implemented by the armed forces of the media, in the issue of human rights to continue the reforms, and on the issue of political reforms, and on the issue of politics and upcoming reforms.

It needs to be clear for Lt. Col. Zumballoween. And to the entire AFP that the NPA will not be able to go to the armed fight until the citizens are not able to achieve the revolutionary movement of its goal.
