It was just witnesses just because of the accident.
By Jimmy Cantos or October 8, 2016 two times when they faced each other in the finals, Ginebra, Tim Cone and Meralco coach Norman Vincent Garalde's same fight in the same fight.
Will it be able to make it up for the third time Norman Tancinco?
I remember what an official of the University of the Middle East was told to me last 80 years ago before he fought the University of the East and the University of the Philippines in the finals ng mga bayani, "Nad in the third time," said the official.
In the said season, UP did not release two times by UP.
In the opinion of many, UP arrived in the fight of UP during those times but UP did not make the beauty of the fight that the Roque showed.
According to the third time?
They faced each other in Game 1 last night when Game 2 will be done on Sunday night.
Cone has won a 17 title, including 13 that he won while he was the coach of Alaska, while 11 were recorded dead by the Black Nazarene, while 11 were captured by the two, Cone of Alaska, and the Black Nazarene.
That's why if the discussion is cowards, the two are almost the same.

The only thing they are saying is that Ginebra will only be placed under the PBA Governor's Cup crown, which is why he / she fans.
We know what can be the effect of fan to a team.

We also know how full of Ginebra has a fan.
This is what Cone said that Ginebra can only be with Ginebra in the series.
What can be the only cause of Meralco?
The win of the team in TNT Katropa bench is not a joke so the children of Norman Vincent Peale cannot be ignored.
This is the first entry of the team in the finals, that's why it's likely that this will be the sole leader of the team but will just be vigilant, hence, it will be exported by Ginebra?
