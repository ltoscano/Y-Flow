Went home.

Listening to Albay Governor Joey Salceda said that during the time that we are writing this column, the governor of Zero is announced after typhoon Ruby.
Residents who were evacuated in the evacuation centers are going home already.
Not only Governor Salceda is not the only one to stop, including the police in the province and the media, they helped them to save the community.
The result of the early preparation is very good, in focusing on the agencies of the government in the action of the storm and the consecutive minutes of the media.
I have heard in radio that the children are said to be in the evacuation centers in Mindoro and is ordered to be given Vitamin C.
"What is coming from, is it right? I also proved that people will not complain or complain if they understand what the community leaders are doing.
I am in Bicol at the height of Ruby because I am going to monitor the buses that should be riding the cemented boat and many of them are stranded in residents like Matos.
They are suffering for a few days and are waiting at the pier, but all are worried and have no effect on the orders of the authorities because they understand that what the government is doing for the safety of all is important.
Maybe one of the things that we should focus on next time is to take care of people in the area of the storm even if they are not from there.
This happens in areas with the dock or airports like Bicol.
The local government should also serve those who are stranded in their areas because of the typhoon.
I heard that there was a landslide in Puerto Galera.
This is still one, it should also be early and it is clear that there is a landslide in the area.
We have learned a lot from Yolanda.
The "attitude" of each one every time there is a typhoon is gone.
Even small details are being thought out and prepared for.
You can do it.
