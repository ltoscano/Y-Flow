If I will be Vice President Jojo Binay, I will let Navotas Representative Toby Tiangco because he is confident with the fight against the rottenness of the current government.
This should be considered by Binay because what the country needs is a person with conviction for the truth and good governance of the government.
A serious sacrifice will surely be done and currently being experienced by Mang Toby because his attacks on the current leadership especially more than his hands is the same meaning of the loss of assistance from the local government in his jurisdiction.
It is good that his brother, Mayor John Rey Tiangco, is there with his own fund which is why if not, they will surely be able to treat them in service to basic commodities.
If the dialogue in the fight of Toby Tiangco in the Senate happened, it seems that he is only doing something than other candidates who are saying and applying for Binay because the image of the representative of Navotas in the public is good.
Almost every day, Toby the newspapers, internet, listened to the radio and watching television, which is why if we will talk about it, Tiangco is only talking about it.
Even though Navotas were small, he got his name in the country and here he should be taken care of by Binay to Toby his line-up, it is clear that the traditional politicians to serve the government have a clear space.
There are many of those who are in a senator, "it looks like this is a senator but it looks like it is not going anywhere because their style is rotten and not a bite of the filipino masses.
"That is what Binay should consider as early as it is still early because Toby Toby the line of the opposition does not manipulate the new names in politics.
