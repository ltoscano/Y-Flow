As long as there is political will.

The Monumento to Caloocan is a place in Metro Manila which is a disease "in the head of many mayors in the city.
Here, the plaza is Wagerness, because the game was held and famous in this area of thieves and people with people.
The road that should have been done to the public should be complicated and you gamble a person who is called "Tata" by "Tata".
"For" I don't know, "the word" Tata "has been deceived or called by the police who know their foolishness.
And for those who do not know, the word selfishness is a plunderer and one of the deceit of the vendors here is a short-term. "
The short-mannered family is only one of many things that are included in their modus operandi that is known as the called "Fallen 44."
Because their products are scattered on the road, that is why the result is a severe problem of traffic, because a lot of vendors, the dirt and garbage are everywhere.
Bus and jeepney illegal terminals, they increase in many roads so the flow of traffic is really pain in the head.
"It cannot be denied that the daily commission of snatching is a hold-up, hold-up and other sweetened bosity of the place.
In many years, the Monumento to fact, in a long time, I forget when it passed through that place because of our mentioned reasons.
But now, the Monumento to collect payments will slowly rise because they increase in number.
Traffic is also not like before.
If in the previous vendors, illegal numbers and problems of traffic are being seen, now the Monumento is a picture of hope.
This is a proof that if there is the political will the leaders have, there is no reason for a crooked path to correct.
This is a proof that Mayor Orca is working.
