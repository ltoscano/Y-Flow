Meanwhile, Senator Bongbong Marcos is only one of those who have hit Roxas after saying that the placing of funds to P10.9 billion pesos in DILG for the housing and irrigation in different parts of the country is wrong.
It is obvious that Marcos did not notice that he is not going to the alliance with the LP because it seems that all his actions will be pushed by PNoy, that is why he is doing the right thing to remain as critics of the ruling party of LP.
