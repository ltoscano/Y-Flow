We can do: The Marcos family should follow the agreement.
According to August 16, 2016, according to former President Fidel Ramos and former DILG Sec. Rafael Alunan, when they agreed that the Marcos family will be buried in Ilocos Norte, the Marcos family should not agree to be buried in the Libingan ng mga Bayani (LNMB).
Many of our countrymen did not care about the strong rain this past week in order to go to Rizal Park to show their opposition of the planned burial of Marcos at LNMB which up to now they are still looking for justice.
As said by one family, the Marcos family is still good because they still have a corpse to be buried in the whole world, but until now, we can see that the next generation of Marcos in the LNMB will surely be seen, but after a few years, we will forgive them and they will forget their sins.
Is this kind of attitude and attitude that we want to look at our youth?
Hopefully not.
