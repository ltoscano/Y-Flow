Flattery by PNoy.

The reaction of Malacanang is funny when it was released by the media to release the list of senators and congressmen who were said to have a transaction with pork barrel scam, Janet Napoles.
Well, to contact you, instead of losing the President to suffer because together with his companions in the list, it turns out that he does not excuse them.
So, that is the Tuwid na Daan "of our president?
If you are enemies in politics, the investigation will be held in politics, and to a speed of lightning for the charges, however, if the Presidential Communications (Operations Office (WBC) chief Sonny Coloma has to have an ally, "is" Tuwid na Daan "under PNoy?
Even though it is true that the version of the Pageist who came from former Senator Ping Lacson, who was appointed by the President as a rehabilitation czar, did not deny this list, it cannot be denied by Malacanang that this issue is about corruption.
Strong is the resolve of the President here because he is elected by the people because of the belief that it will destroy the widespread corruption in our country that does not have a relationship.
But what did Coloma have done?
Well, even if it is not yet done by the investigation, he says he is saying that it has nothing to do with the President's leadership under Budget Secretary Florencio Abad and Agriculture Secretary Proceso Alcala as the pork barrel scam of Napoles.
What is it that even if it's just for example, Coloma said that the President is investigating his personnel who were caught by the UV Express in order to remove them from position if they have a basis?
"," hopefully our belief will be relieved, this "Tuwid na Daan" of PNoy will be relieved.
If I will be asked, it is clear that until PNoy is not being carried away by his own blood, the time he is hanging on the scandal would come that the time will come that no one believes in him.
