We can help PRody Duterte for the fight against illegal drugs.
He was able to reveal on September 20, 2016.
President Rodrigo Duterte himself admitted that it is only now that he sees that there is really a huge problem with illegal drugs in our country, after a few months, he saw that Duterte himself was the one who named as protectors, for a few months, Duterte asked for additional six months to finish this problem.
If we recall, one of the promises of Duterte is to end the crime in our country within his first six months as President, it seems that this will not happen so he asked for additional time.
The truth is, it is really hard to fix this problem because it has been neglected for a long time by our government, there is still a lot of addicts who want to buy illegal drugs, but if there are still a few of our countrymen who want to buy illegal drugs, it is definite that the lives of our government will surely die if there will be a few of our countrymen who will become victims of these plague to our society.
For our parents, we should not depend this fight to Duterte and our police so that our children will be far from their school, if we do not want them to join the sports, they should be sure that we will be able to prevent them from illegal drugs in our society.
