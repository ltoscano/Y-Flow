The public failed to Manny.
By Bernard Taguba, July 19, 2016.
It seems that the Filipino people are losing to the Pambansang Kamao Manny Pacquiao, especially his / her second term as congressman in Sarangani on the 16th Congress in his second term as congressman for almost 200 session in the span of three years.
In fact, Pacquiao has attended a session for the whole year of 2015, that's why the people are weak from her and his staff.
Yes, Pacquiao gave an honor to the Filipino people because of his wins in boxing since 2013 until 2016 when he did not enter his job.
Yes, peanuts and peanuts are asking for his salary to be more than P70,000 every month but it is still money of the people that he should work, especially since he is given a mandate to those from Sarangani to become a representative of the Congress.
Pacquiao should be ashamed of the people who gave him a mandate.

Everyone is expecting that Pacquiao will change his Social Work and especially that he is now a senator now.
If he has plans to fight again, do not take a session for him to serve the country and recover his shortcomings when he is a congressman.
What's ugly is the record that the lawmaker is the most powerful lawmaker in the company of the Congress.
Even if he is holding the 8th year division world champion in boxing, if the record is connected to his absenteeism, he is weak.
Hopefully, the incumbent congressmen should serve as a lesson to the Congress to release the record of lawmakers in the legislative chamber to release them somehow.
If they really do not have plans to enter their job, hopefully people will no longer run and fool people who want to work for the payment of the government to be paid for by the government.
