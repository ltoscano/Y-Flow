Ghost!

The "Ghost is known as well as the call of 15-30 to be known in all branches of the national police but this problem seems to be wise in the leadership of the Philippine National Police because they have not given attention.
In the celebration of a ABS-year-old police official, the start when he entered the police 30 years August, there was a host of "ghosts," but saddening, according to him, he said, because he did not feel disgusted.
In the total of 150,000 forces of the PNP, it is estimated that ten percent of the policemen, who did not go to their duty, are the Ghost of this when it comes to the dates 15 and the end of the month to get their salary.
To be proud of this system, the Ghost is placed in number by the police commander or one of the Ghost is a source of income, or even the others are heading to other countries to work.
A few are not going to their homes to make money, for example, through illegal activities, for 15-30, the owner of the club, to earn and be placed inside the police commander in order to earn and be able to make it to the police commander in order to earn money, which is to be a colony of illegal drugs.
Just in Metro Manila, approximately thousands are called "Ghost COP," most of us are in Manila, according to our payment, the continuing prevalence of 15-30 minutes is a problem that should be given attention by the administration.
Because, even if they will not be able to go to school, the government is spending their own hands and other benefits of the police, Mister Juan thought, his tax that they have been paying for salary is being used properly but the truth will be wasted.
Maybe General Purisima and the Aquino administration needs to act to stop the bad system of the PNP.
