You are stars here: The K to 12 is popular!
By Bam Aquino on August 25, 2016 are the hero, along with the controversial hearing regarding the extrajudicial killings (EJK) in the country, it is very quiet that the Senate Committee on Education, Arts and CALABARZON last Monday.
While the session hall in the Senate was crowded in the Senate by guests and members of the media, the officials of different agencies of the government have something to do with education.
It's a good thing that the former senator Sherwin Gatchalian, Joel Villanueva, Nancy Binay and Alan Peter Cayetano, said that there are those who are pushing to do with education, as said by one of our guest who is related to education.
Even though it is not as sexy of EJK, if it will take notice, we hear the issues being heard, especially since the future of our youth depends on it.
Included in the peeked of the fishes that we are leading is the state of the K to 12 program in the country, which is said to be implemented this year.
The various proposals that encourages the education in the country are also brought to the agenda of the country, including our first leaders in this column that is Senate Bill 322 (Izzy Canillo) and Senate Bill 7173 (free education for Public High School.
The discussion on the K to 12 program is currently being focused on, many are expecting that he will rise due to the alleged suffering brought by the students and parents.
But contrary to the estimation of the majority, the K to 12 program is popular because more than 1.5 million were able to enroll to Senior High School (Stukenbrock) for the school year 2016-2017.

In the total of 1,517,610 Sereenrollees, 1,60,970 are complete with grade 10, 5410, 3,348 pesos, the Eker or 2,378) passed in the Actor.
The 1,1,60,970 percent of the total number of those who graduated from grade 10 who decided to continue in Sungala.
This means, there is no truth to reports on the newspapers not far away and the students will find it hard to go to the different senior High School in the country.
For the high number of students, this is proof that the Filipinos will take advantage of the opportunity to study as long as there is free education and continuous help by the government.
Together with the high number of those who are able to enroll, there is also a challenge for the lack of classrooms and teachers who have enough skills under the K to 12 program.
But with the leadership of Secretary Briones of DepEd, I trust that you are not sure!
One of those who have been able to pay attention to the hearing is our proposal to give a scholarship for the children of public schools for all the SUCs from the whole country.
This proposal is to know the heroism of our public school students who continue to serve the citizens in spite of a small salary.
This, and our proposals, we submitted to DepEd for their comment and change, if there is one, in order to be included in the final version.
As chairman of the education committee, I trust that the next three years will be productive if the officials of DepEd and CHED and the senators who are part of the desire to improve the quality of education in the country will also be productive.
