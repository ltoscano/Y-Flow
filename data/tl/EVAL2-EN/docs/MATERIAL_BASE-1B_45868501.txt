Selfies "!

A while ago when a child came near, he was silent and could not hear) but I could not hear) that's why I pulled out paper and ballpen so that I'm the first one to write.

She was stared at what I have written and then she looked at her parents.

According to the parents: "Father English, she understands that it is good that it is good that I have money in English a while ago.

But it is gladdening to see the child even if he has disability.

She was very happy when she was borrowing and, because he became faster, she could have accepted the administration for a long time.

When I was about to leave, his / her mother told me that I am really thank you or if that is really a good sign or if that is really the child's good sign or if that is really a positive perspective in life!

That's why for those who feel that it seems that no one is noticing, that we have not noticed, who is very lonely, which seems like there is no good tomorrow, that there is no good future, that is why there is no good life that we will spend in sadness.
