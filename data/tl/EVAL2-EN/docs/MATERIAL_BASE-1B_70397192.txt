All should be part of the solution.
October 17, 2016 - a 21-year-old man has been suspended for 21 minutes from the length of EDSA due to the dry run of the "tanim-bala" policy of the number coding scheme of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA).
The implementation of the "Ipit Gang" policy that will be implemented starting today, October 17.
The goal of removing the window to the covetous vehicle is to reduce the heavy flow of traffic everyday which is experienced by the motorists starting today, all private vehicles that hit the number covetousness of the said days are not able to take advantage of the former implemented window that was released from 10: 00 in the morning until three o'clock in the afternoon.
This means, no one can travel from seven o'clock in the morning up to seven o'clock in the morning up to seven o'clock in the evening.
Included in the areas where it is part of the "tanim bala" "is EDSA, C5 Road, Alabang, Zapote Road and Roxas Boulevard.
The "Ipit Gang" policy of the MMDA together with the Interagency Council for Traffic (I-ACT) to free up even the flow of traffic especially now that rainy season.
There is an alternative route for the vehicles to be hit by the said policy and this is the use of 17-Mabuhay Lanes to reach their destination.
We agree with the implementation of the new generation that we know, that we know a sacrifice for some who will get hit but if it causes comfort to many of our countrymen, why does not have to refuse.
In this situation, it is very important to let wide understanding especially the good of the majority depends on it.
That's why we aspire to continue the successful success of the government for prosperity, but for us, we should be fair in implementing, not those who will be given favor or even if they are saying something in society.
