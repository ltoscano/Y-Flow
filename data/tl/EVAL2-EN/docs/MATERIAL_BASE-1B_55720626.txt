All the piccolo from the piccolo!

Year, every time after New Year's Day, the many victims of fireworks, especially the piccolo, are a problem.
Before the New Year, "the PNP and DOH are confused on the prohibition of the accident to avoid bad effects.
But "their warning did not push through because instead of getting down, those who were wounded and hurt by fireworks, and those who were hurt by firecrackers, were irritated and irritated by the piccolo.
In the report, the frequent damage on the New Year is from the piccolo, the piccolo is one of the different kinds of fireworks that is prohibited, but what is surprising is that they are sold in a sidewalk.
If there is an agency that should be held accountable, that is the national police because they are considered by the authorities but the law should not rule out.
If the children of General Alan Purisima are working, well, it is definite that the piccolo being sold are not seen.
We think, the campaign of the PNP and the government is not enough against the denim piccolo and other kinds of fireworks.
Only one year has passed, the many wounded, some died because of firecrackers.
I am just wondering.
If in Davao City, Mayor Rodrigo Duterte needs to let the said ban on, why not for others?
Maybe many Mayor Duterte needs to stop the use of fireworks to prevent those who get hurt.
In the whole Philippines, in Davao City, no one was reported to use piccolo and other disastrous scandal.
This is because the Davaoe√±os are following the command to be known as a good mayor who was known because of his "political will."
"It is not difficult to be like Duterte who is said to be red and red.
Political will only be the weapon of the towns and cities in order for the government to achieve your desires, "when the celebration of change in the year comes.
