Challenge to Jojo and Mar.

The problem about the heinous crime is huge and almost all of the workers in the country are becoming a huge percentage of the country, because they are using the contract that will give power to their employers to leave them at work during five months.
This is not just against the security of the 1987 Constitution, this is illegal and it may be illegal because the workers of the right to progress in their status in life if they have become regular and that does not change.
I am now here in Butuan City and all employees of the malls, living and other businesses here, big or small, are all "balls." Not only in Butuan City which is rampant in the whole country.
What is the view of Jojo Binay and Mar Roxas, the two female personalities who want to be president in 2016 about the problem of contractualization?
I am calling for a student who is calling the campus of the campus of the campus of Binay to take a debate on said issue including the issue regarding corruption, poverty and ability to be the president of the country.
Let us plead to the two that they are going to face the TV camera and tell the "if there are no corrupt, there is no poor," let us see if they are believable.

Let us also limit to Mar to say in front of the camera of "I have the ability to give a solution to all the crisis that comes to the country like Yolanda."
Jojo is also asking us to tell the "" I am not corrupt and I am angry to the greedy family in power and power. "
I wish to be the center of the debate of Jojo and Mar if we can earn a student who is renting.
