Why do you fight with Binay?

The destruction of those aspiring to become president of the country with VP Jojo Binay is too much, that his intention to join the presidential fight in 2016 is too much.
Many are asking why Binay can escape from the simultaneous fire in his life, which is probably considered the most difficult challenge and challenge to his political race.
It's because it cannot be said that Binay's current administration is going to end or are almost over because the demolition of 2016 where Binay is on top of the fight will start.
Even the allies of Binay, we heard that Binay is having two thoughts in running to the Presidential fight because it is clear in the survey that, when a person does not have to go down to the survey, the lower part will continue.
We also found out that the members of the Legislative Chamber promised to transfer to the camp of Binay to transfer to the camp of Binay.
Aside from the lawmakers who promised support and transfer to Binay, the local politicians who have already given support for vice president also cannot be revealed now.
In the latest survey of Pulse Asia that was done on the second week of September, it fell to 15 percent the approval of vice President where it took 66 percent from the former 81 percent.
Binay is going through serious now because what he planted almost 30 years in the world of politics is possible that there will be a trace of wind which is difficult to happen now because it can be said that Senator Alan Cayetano is decided to continue the investigation even if it can be said that Senator Alan Cayetano is decided to continue the investigation even if it can be said that he will be said in exchange of hearing aid.
It is certain that there are still a lot of fire that will come to the Binay family and this is what they should have been prepared for before because politics is really different from the country, since the names of Aquino, Cayetano and others.
