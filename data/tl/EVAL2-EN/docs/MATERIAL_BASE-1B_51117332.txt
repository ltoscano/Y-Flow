Being doubly careful with RTECAYETANO!

Is there a double-mindedness of a senator from Taguig City, Sen. Alan Cayetano?
You, my friends, judge him!
If you can remember, it was said that in 2010, Cayetano said that it is not true that a person is coward if he is buying a word about the issues he is facing in the country.
Related to this was the Presidential candidate Senator Manny Villar, who was scheduled to face the 12 senators in the Senate Committee to investigate the C-5 Road scandal.
Cayetano himself said that there is no reason for Villar to face the said committee because there was a judge who is guilty in the end of his fellow senators.
There is a court and a civil wedding where Villar should face, according to Cayetano.
If this is the reason of Cayetano, why are he insisting that Vice President Jejomar Binay is insisting that he will face Vice President Jejomar Binay in their committee who has not been carried away by that they are accused and he is judged by them.
Isn't it that since the end, we can clearly see that the Senate Blue Ribbon sub-committee is clearly seen?
The mother of the companions almost helped them to be destroyed so that Binay will be destroyed just to be destroyed.
Is there justice that Binay can see on for example he faced the said committee?
Isn't it that they have not yet carried out that they are allegations against Binay, they are the one being accused of a thief!
All the wrong information presented by ex-Vice Mayor Ernesto Mercado, they immediately believe and even the children of the Vice-President are included in their wrong disposal for Binay.
Why Villar has the right to give proper treatment?
