We can watch out to watch out.
He was born on July 5, 2016.
During the time of the campaign, I visited some of Relocation Site in Bulacan, I saw the tragic situation of our countrymen where many of them experienced hunger because of the lack of jobs that are near their place, and aside from this, they need to pay very expensive just for water and electricity.
"With many of them, their lives in Manila are better because even if they are not in their own house they have a job and are eating properly, hopefully it will be given attention by our government and the new administration.
Hopefully it would not just be thrown away from where our countrymen are just going to where they will not have a proper life in the area, which is sad is that, after the election, it is sad that they cannot see the politician who campaigned for their votes.
I told them that they should keep all the promises of the politicians in their area and after the election they will go to him and they will be charged with them if they will not do this and they will always be fooled by them.
This is not just a challenge to them but to the challenge of many politicians for the TV Abird that they have given to every Filipino and free treatment for every Filipino, now that they are elected in position, we should be charged by them.
We salute them so we should serve as honest and orderly for every Filipino, if we see them losing their names and we can't forget their names and we can't forget that these politicians are the ones who should not vote for.

We are stupid if we will vote for our leaders again that are just repeating the promise, but I am always being abused.
Now that the election is over, it is not only President Rody Duterte and Vice President Leni Robredo in the hope of our country that every Filipino should take part of politics so that we can make sure that our leaders will destroy their promises.
