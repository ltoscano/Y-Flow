Marcos will be forgiven - Pacquiao By Boyet Jihadist, August 16, 2016.
Senator Manny Pacquiao stared at the burial of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr. at the Libingan ng mga Bayani (LNMB) in Taguig City to take back the hot topic regarding it.
Pacquiao insisted that whatever the fault of former President Marcos to the people, he needs to forgive him so that the country will move on on this issue.
"We should not be angry whatever he has done, there is a need to talk about it, because we do not have forgiveness, we have no forgiveness to our hearts, we should not forget his contribution to the country despite his declaration of Martial Law that became the stain of his administration.
"We should also think, let us not forget," said the senator, "even what kind of person is, we will have a case."
