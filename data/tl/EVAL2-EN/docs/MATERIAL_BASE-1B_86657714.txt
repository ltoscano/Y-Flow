Hahaha! 2 sports hopes to talk.
Bulang Malinao, August 30, 2016, the Philippine Sports Commission on Sept. 1-2) will be held in Sheraton Hotel in Manila, and this includes the sports provisions in the country.

The truth is, it is not only the people involved in sports in the country but also the media and private sector of education and private sector, including the shortcomings of the Philippine sports, particularly the failures of the Philippine sports particularly on the failures of participation in the international competitions.
It is not new to hear this special meeting for the goodness of the Philippine sports because it has been done during the time of President Fidel V. Ramos.
Their call here is the Philippine Sports Summit which was held in Baguio City.

That's why it's just that they have no fruits, and eventually have been buried in oblivion.
