What: Digong need to enter?
By Al G. October 28, 2016, is it really fear that Cojuangco was given to Ricky Vargas?
Like that.
Because if he is not afraid, he will let the democracy push through and he will be able to cover his Vargas fight for president for the Philippine Football Committee (Commission C), which is as if he is under the implementation of our sports in the 2004 election.
But the Philippine sports in Wednesday will take shelter especially by the darkness in Wednesday when the Liberal Party is owned by BOC C COMELEC (Commission on November. 25.
It is only now that the COMELEC can see a association.
Under a democratic system, it will only be a recommendation to any Comelec when it comes with fixers.
In the normal trend, only the entire House (General Assembly) is only the entire House (General Assembly) only with the final decision whether he is disapt, Vargas or not.
You will be fooled by Cojuangco again?
Last 2008, owned by Go Teng was discovered because he was exiled by Estrada who could have been endorsed by BOC C.

Last 2012, MVP back down when the adherent of Cojuangco was very popular in fear.
Now, because Vargas is always absent from BOC C General Assembly recently, he is worthless.
Is it really nothing to take care of Cojuangco?
Maybe Digong might enter the scene, you are the same.
"You are not cheap.
