Meanwhile, General Purisima is still being investigated.

Rosalinda L. Orosa (Pilipino Star Ngayon) - November 9, 2014 - 12: 00.

Is it covered with Vice President Jejomar Binay's issue about the Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Director General Alan Purisima?, because of the heat being thrown at the Makati Parking Bureau, Nueva Ecija, the issue was suddenly closed just like a fire which suddenly fell into a cold water.
The urge because of the issue of those being accused of Purisima is the same thing that nothing will happen to the cases of the PNP Chief, he is allegedly involved in other cases of corruption, he is also involved in other cases of corruption, and he says he is also involved in other cases of corruption, he is also involved in other cases of corruption.
When the Office of the Ombudsman was asked to ask the case filed against the PNP Chief, they said it was the beginning.
"On a check on Purisima, it is said that it is not true that the investigation involving the PNP Chief is not true, according to Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales, they have already received the final report of the committee led by Senator Grace Poe because according to Morales a long time ago and it is expected that they will finish the" written agreement with Purisima.
Hopefully the investigation or discussion on Purisima should only be implemented on Purisima.
