Ramon Bautista, shrimp, looks not good here!

David D, Angelo.
Davao City, opinion - opinion, Pinoy Artillero, Ramon Bautista.

Is it right that Ramon Bautista is right, "a lot of shrimp in Davao City?" This means that a lot of women in Davao City will say that their bodies are beautiful but it looks like it is a joke or it seems that they are even though it's a joke or it looks like she has been mistaken for it?

In my opinion, it seems that in this moment, he was brought by his comedian Ramon Bautista. It seems that he got even though she was even insulted by women and became an insult to women.

My colleagues in the office are saying to me that they are only doing this, and if you will do it to a very big as big as a big as big as a big as big as a problem in Davao City, it is certain that this is a big mistake.

But, is it right to declare Ramon Bautista in Davao?

If we will study it well, what Ramon Bautista did is to abuse the rights of women in Davao City or human rights. "Human rights" are you okay?

Said to the resolution!

"Thea is a person to let the world know that he / she wants to go to Mister Bautista that he / she was the one to be famous in the Priority Development Assistance Fund).

If we will follow this, isn't it that there have been no increase in the Philippines and this includes a lot of politicians, widen the bullets and power in the right thing.

However, that is the opinion of the City Council of Davao City, Arinoli, who is a hero.
