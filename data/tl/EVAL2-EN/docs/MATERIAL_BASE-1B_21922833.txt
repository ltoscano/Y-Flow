On researching for the self.

Allocate time to make yourself in a room and have a serious time to know the course of your own life if it is not progress, just to finish, and if not, will not be made.

Study how to make peace with yourself and make the voice that he always talks to you.

Give enough attention to yourself.

Do not act, remain silent, let each other be alone.

Pray, thank you, give thanks, and take care of your imagination, to strengthen your imagination, peace and the glory better, follow what your heart is courting with the mysterious mind.
