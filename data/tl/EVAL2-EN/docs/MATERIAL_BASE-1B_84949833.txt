PNP sentenced to chase after the back of EJK By Bernard Taguba, July 21, 2016 was firmly condemned by Vice President Leni Robredo who did not let go from the killing or extrajudicial killings (EJK) that is currently happening in the country, which is said to be alarming.
In a statement released by Robredo yesterday, he asked that this violence should be stopped in the middle of the anti-drug operations of the national police.
"We should not accept the Pinoy culture for fear, murder and lack of respect for the rights of a person to live," said Robredo, many other victims were killed by unknown culprits.
Because of this, Robredo challenged the PNP to investigate those behind the EJK because they are taking the law in their hands.
These should be held accountable because if not, this kind of murder will continue where the victims will leave their right to live.
"The increase of extrajudicial killings is the call to everyone to respect the rights of a person to have a honest trial," according to Robredo.
There is no one who has the right to kill the lives even if the victims have a sin that is why it should be stopped as soon as possible.
