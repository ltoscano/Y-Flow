Eduardo Discipline Office of the NPA-Camarines Sur led the death penalty that was rejected by Pamilihang Lungsod of Jaime Ordep, of Brgy. Tribute, Baao, Camarines Sur.

1 - the Philippine Army is one of the Philippine Army since the '80s, and particularly as agents of the 42nd Infantry Batallion.

2 - it was captured last 2006 with the NPA unit of Ka Zarraga, Ka Tony, and Ka Ian who is based in Sitio San Jose, Brgy. Tribute.

3 - it was captured last 2007 in the same barangay unit of the NPA in the same barangay of tribute, Baao.

Aside from his critical crime, Oryang is also served as a zealous leader, Bantay, from the decades of 80 percent in the '85th until 2007.

Confiscated from the shotgun was a shotgun.

Meanwhile, the son of Ordep Ocampo, Jaime Jr. fought back, which is why the NPA allegedly fought with the defense, Jaime Jr. and was taken from him by a caliber .45 pistol.

Eduardo Discipline Office is calling the individuals who are elements of the AFP-PNP-Kidnapping Group who condemned their units and responsible for the ranks of poor people who are oppressed by the leaders of the AFP-PNP-governmental organization, to serve as the basis of the fighting against corrupt and those who win the citizens.
