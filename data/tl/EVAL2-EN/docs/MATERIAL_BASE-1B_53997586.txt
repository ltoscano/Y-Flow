We can do it: Peace.
He was born on July 29, 2016.
The first state of the Nation Address or SONA of President Rodrigo Duterte was known in different issues that he discussed, but the protagonist is still the protagonist's fight against illegal drugs in our country.
You have also warned that corrupt cops if they will not fix themselves, he will make sure that they will make sure that they are the ones who are killed by Duterte because many are saying that there are many killed drug pushers because the police themselves kill them.
It is said that these policemen are afraid that it might be revealed that the drug pushers who were involved in illegal drugs will be revealed because, instead, Duterte should not be held accountable because it is true that Duterte would not achieve his goal in order to stop illegal drugs in our country.
One of the reasons that Duterte has stated in his SONA is when he said that the lives of our soldiers who died will not be replaced with money and medals.
In his SONA, Duterte said that he is asking a ceasefire between our military and the CPP-NPA, this step is still important, but until now, we are still supporting the steps of Duterte to push the permanent peace in the whole country.
Hopefully the CPP-NPA will agree with the MILF and the MNLF and the MNLF in the ceasefire, so that the progress of our country will continue especially in our countryside.
Aside from this, Duterte also promised that he will give attention to the worsening traffic in Metro Manila, in truth, a lot of hours will be wasted because of traffic so it will be given to Clark. If it will surely lessen the traffic in our country.
Good luck to President Duterte, hopefully she can do his good plans for our country.
