"Peace Agreement and all sorts."

All of us aspire peace in our country but it is not right to sign that no justice is not right, "the peace talks and all its price are equivalent to the lives of the 44 PNP-SAF who have no charisma that is not based on justice.
There are some who are pushing the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) who are doing nothing except for the passing of our police because of the very group, Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which will benefit more and not rush the passing of BBL.
This should not be known to be the basis of the passing of this law but the rightfulness of this should be clear, especially now that it seems that it is against our constitution.
The heroism of the 44 PNP-SAF in Mamasapano, Maguindanao will be more acceptable if it will transfer of a better law that will give importance to our siblings in Muslim Mindanao.

The exchange of alter "peace and all sorts of people is the reason why the government has agreed to know that our government should respect the approval of the MILF as the reason why our government should respect the MILF, which is why our policemen have been killed in Mamasapano.
The PNP had no coordination with the MILF, which is why the bloody incident happened.
But when it has happened in the history of the world, even if we need to ask permission from its own citizens, it should be said that the MILF and the MILF are separated from our territory?

Kudal-Anthony Castelo, Lloyd Cruz, Cita Alum and Imelda Papin, because of their very beautiful gift to those who are widow of SAF 44, the Elite and hero unit of the Philippine National Police that was swept by Moro Islamic Liberation Front, this Independence Day.
The gift of this gift, it is just announced that there are three beautiful and new songs such as those who are left behind by our heroes.
