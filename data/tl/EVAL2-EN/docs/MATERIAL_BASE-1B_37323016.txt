The typhoon Noynoy death in the town.

There is only a small typhoon or Yolanda who reached Visayas, especially typhoon Sendong and Pablo that drowned Mindanao after the war in Zamboanga would be included, it is nothing to typhoon Noynoy Aquino III.
The last increase in price of gasoline and similar products are not a joke, certainly, the sector of the Filipino sector, there are the drivers who just passed by the fare, the price of oil and oil increased.
What is bad, instead of explain the oil companies, the Department of energy said that the increase is right because of the effect of war in Iraq?
Just when the price of petroleum products went up, garlic is first from 80 pesos per kilo in almost P400 per kilo.
Like the oil, instead of giving an explanation to the businessmen who are involved in the graves, Department of Agriculture (DA), the style is, they are wondering?
The additional calamity brought by Typhoon Noynoy, this is the increase of bills of water and electricity.
In the moment it will be implemented, an additional effect would happen to the lives of ordinary people.
We cannot answer a lot of questions by our countrymen but do they know that the Aquino administration has a solution for the increase in all price of goods?
They say, all the storm have passed through the suffering brought by the destruction of the price of typhoon Noynoy Aquino III?
For us, the lack of interest in the implementation of the regime of Noynoy went through the slow increase in price of all goods, they do not care because their expenses are free, especially in gasoline and oil.
Because their pocket is full of money, even if the price increase is still as high in heaven, they can do it.
So, where do they be able to take advantage of their operation?
We believe in the people.
And in the coming SONA of Noynoy Aquino, what would be the reason for him to waste his leadership?
