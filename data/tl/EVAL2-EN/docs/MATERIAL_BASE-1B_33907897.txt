Traffic Management Council.

A good traffic management is needed in Metro Manila.
All the traffic management, which was launched by the Metro Manila Development Authority, especially in the time of Heroes Fernando and Francis Tolentino, are already launched, but they won't win.
This failure is not the only fault of the MMDA because the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and Department of Transportation and communication are involved.
In the past, our manager thought there is a number covetous situation on the serious traffic but they are wrong that instead of lessen the number of vehicles, whether traffic or public, the traffic would be further strengthened.
When the number coding has failed, they read a lot of new vehicles that are everywhere in our city of Phaska, old vehicles, their next proposal, one thing that they cannot be implemented.
This Christmas season, they are going to release the Christmas lane which is a type of disapprove of the tight roads of Metro Manila but it is hard to implement because of our streets that are living there.
They also changed the number of the shopping mall from 11: 00 a.m., do they not know that those who go to the mall in the morning?
The traffic Jam is not because of the malls but also because of the volume of traffic enforcers, especially the jeepney and bus drivers, they do not care in fulfilling the traffic Regulations.
In the afternoon, traffic is getting worse because the malls started to worsen until 11 p.m.
And let us not forget the DPWH and his fights with unblinking while playing in our streets as if they seem to be accompanied by EP-fried / Raul VALNAs.
