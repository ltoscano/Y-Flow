Can't be.

Others say, it is no longer no light, just do not have water.
I do not know if many are in favor of being a "will, light or electricity, or the big lack of this is the big problem of the country at present.
Isn't it that there are many politicians in Mindanao who lost last election because of the severe issue on the voters, the lack of electricity supply?
The people are angry, punishment if there is no electricity.
And millions of pesos are missing for the businesses during brownouts because they should just think of what is difficult for those who experience 6 to 8 hours of brownouts in Mindanao, in the middle of this severe heat.
And because of the lack of water, there has been a warning that because of drought, it's likely that the supply of water is likely to be removed.
Some of the congressmen are calling the Lower House of the Congress to support the farmers and release an emergency room for those who will be affected by the lack of irrigation in the farm.
Alarming news that may happen.
So what can be lost from the two if we will just choose the water or light.
It is hard to buy, we should not choose.
The total economy is very affected, with no electricity, the whole country will get hurt if their businesses are lost.
If the agricultural sector has no water, the whole country will suffer.
That's why what is being said before is not possible that if there is no light, just do not have water.
Now, it cannot be no light, and there should be always a supply of water.
In a healthy country, the citizens should not choose the things that should be given to them by the state of their rights.
The government cannot always ask for pity for the farmers, for example, most of poverty have been submerged in poverty and more burden to the lack of water.
