We can thank you: Thank you.
He was able to explain on September 30, 2016.
One of the good news last week is the statement of Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Leonor Briones that his department is being studied by the youth in our schools to know if what happened during martial law is right.
According to Briones, he himself became a victim of Martial Law so he knows the bad reason it caused our society, wherein many of our youth now have no idea what really happened during that time.
Well, the son of the former dictator will almost win as vice president, it is good that Vice President Leni Robredo won last election and forget what happened during the time of Martial Law.
Aside from this, until now, the Marcos family has not admitted their sins to the country where a few billion dollars are used for our country, especially to some of the families who lost their loved ones during the time of Martial Law?
With this action of DepEd, hoping for our next generation of Filipinos to show them that this time the freedom of our country is gone, hopefully our youth have lost their wealth so we should not allow this time to go back to our country.
