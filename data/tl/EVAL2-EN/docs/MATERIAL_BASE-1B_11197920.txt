The call to check the police check was strong.
Let's move on this call to know the truth behind the destruction of money by a few retired police.
How much life became luxuriously, it will be known through a check-check - which is why this call has been implemented.
And if this will be done, Chief Dir. Gen. Alan Purisima will put to follow the other police General according to the event that they have signed to.
Because of the report, the general who earned money from them had become rude to them through "immune system."
The immune system is the method of the elected police official to earn money, using your trusted personnel.
These are those who are calling on the operation of gambling, drugs, to show fish, red or prostitution, urinating, and whatever may they need to earn.
We do not say that Purisima has earned money from illegal drugs but the question of many, they said, the general got his wealth?
In the expose of Ted Failon on his twitter account, in ABS-CBN, the number of properties of Purisima has been taken off.
To know the truth about what was revealed by Ted Failon, it is appropriate to do the first check in the PNP Chief.
The solution to the check is if this will push through - it is also a chance for Purisima to clean his name.
Because they were allegedly close to the president, he was given by those who are calling his position but he allegedly used it when he stole money.
Aside from Purisima, many generals became a millionaire because their position was used to earn money.
It's not only the generals who became luxuriously because even PO 1 became a millionaire because of those who can buy.
They are those who are PO 1 Police, but because they did not complain, they had a mansion and model vehicles.
If it will be implemented, a British millionaire will surely take the revelations on illegal resources that are coming from illegal wealth.
