First in front of Ilocos Norte, MRI is desirable to help the diseases especially to victims of stroke or heart attack.

According to Dacuycuy, the MRI can be compared to a point of Thy or CT-scans, however, it is considered to be given to an illness in a part of the head of a person.

Not like CT-scans, MRI is focused on for the victims of attack in the brain.

Through this, it will be much faster to give appropriate treatment for the victims of stroke so there is no need to travel to MaterManila or nearby provinces like Ilocos Sur and La Union.

Meanwhile, Dacuycuy could not yet identify how much was the pet fee for this service, however, in his case, it is also like a kilo of CT-scans.

MRI is able to be done through "tanim-public service" through the agreement of Humalig) and the city government of Laoag.

This is worth 50 million where the city of Laoag managed to pay P300,000 every month within 10 years.

After this, the said items are already owned by LCGD.
