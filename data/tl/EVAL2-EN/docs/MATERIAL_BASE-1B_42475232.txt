Laughed.

Laughing, the problem will be removed.

And it is a good remedy for illnesses.

The barking, which can be done in the heart, is needed to be done willingly because even if you don't know how to cry, I will never do not know how to cry, that is why he / she would not do not know how to cry, just to ease the problems.

Life is very short, and that's why you cannot make yourself laugh at all moments.

Always laugh at work, to be happy always.

Laugh at the problems.

Laughed even if she is sick, weak and tired already because the laughter would be lively.

Smile, even if her eyes turned out of ashes, they tried to stop tears from his eyes.

Sing, even if others get sick, even your voice is more opportunities.

He / she was able to step down and he doesn't want to see even if someone saw in the movement of martial law.

Believe, even if your heart is disapproves of your heart because you are honest and together.

Love, even if others are busy and want to be alone.

Because of love is the happiness of heaven.

Let it be, and do not pay attention, it will also pass and you will be blessed.

Forgive, to ease the pain, and do not be afraid to forget.

Believe, that things will voluntarily happen, because this is for the goodness of all.

... and laughed, this is a miracle and an effective remedy for problems.

From a smile, it is a joke to laugh until there is an haunt, because they say it is really different from others, because they are like the same and always with problems.

They have a lot of affection so she didn't laugh at her smile and just laugh at what is very important.

The soap is for the body, laughing from the soul.
