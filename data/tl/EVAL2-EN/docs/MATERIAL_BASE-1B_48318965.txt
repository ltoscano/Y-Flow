By Fortun, October 17, 2016, Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Isagani Zarate insisted that the proposal of the Department of Finance (DOC) should be given taxes for 250,000 every year because it means that those who will benefit from these are the ones who will benefit from this.
According to Zarate, the said tax was very small than 250,000 pesos, which is very small compared to the filipino family, which is estimated to be 996,34.8 or P1,086 wages per day.
Under the proposed House Bill 333, which was filed by Bayan Muna Party, P396,390) the highest wages that should be conquered by the tax exemption by 2,000 pesos (20 percent of Php28.00 per hour (80 percent of Php28.00 per month.
Zarate stressed that those who need the tax will be the most rich 326,000 families (which only reached 1.5 million pesos in the total number of families in the Philippines), with only 91,000 pesos to 113 million pesos per month, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) should be taxed by the higher Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).
Zarate also added that the Chief Executive Disaster Risk Reduction and CEO) of big corporation like San Miguel Corporation (SMC), First Philippine Holyfield (FFF), Meralco are earning from 500,000 pesos to P5.9 million every month and they should be raised up taxes from them.
Based on the data of Ibon Foundation, the 50-coloured house in the Philippines has a total of pork barrel that will be the US $79 billion or equivalent to the value of peso which is P3.8 pesos based on the current Stock Exchange.
Not less than 690 are the Filipinos who have "Tulay ng High School, which is not less than 1.4 billion pesos, which is not less than 1.4 billion pesos in the country, and the 265 Philippine Stock Exchange (Police (Police District) - the 2 billion pesos.
"Ayoy Rich families were the ones to be placed in a lower part of the company of the Office of Our Stars, natural resources of the Our Lady OPLAN), natural resources to be a part of the Social Weather Center of the government," Zarate insisted.
If we will follow the proposal of Zarate, a bigger tax will be gathered by the government if the tax will be increased to the largest 1.5 million pesos of Filipino families because the BIR will gather this for P91 billion pesos.

Zarate believes that there is a need to raise the amount of tax due to the big corporals in its 35 percent rate in the 11-30 billion peso which was held on 2009-30 billion pesos.
On the other hand, he / she was asking for Php409 billion INTRCamping for being a piece of Php409 billion pesos.
The question is if Finance Secretary Carlos Macalintal will agree to this proposal of Bayan Muna and more important is if it will be sent to President Rodrigo Duterte for his appropriate action.
