Together with each other.

Even before the list of Napoles is on the first issue, DOJ Sec. Leila de Lima has already called out to expose this.
But because we are lawyers and I know Secretary de Lima, we know it is not easy.
Now, there are more people who are calling out to release the list of Janet Napoles which he gave to de Lima, that contains all those involved in the PDAF anomaly.
Now, there is a little anger, like lawmakers saying that de Lima has no right to hide the list, especially if it can be considered a public transport, and it should be exposed to know and be examined by the country.
Secretary de Lima probably is the only one who knows the reason why he did not reveal the list.
There are those who have been given the reason but many are still not expecting to be good.
I have a big trust to DOJ Secretary that I became a teacher because I know he has a sharp mind and I know the strong principle that he gives importance to justice and justice.
The status of Justice Department is very important.
There are many big issues in the country's future, together together.
The issues should be given attention by the department of De Lima, ten of the agencies under his leadership as DOJ Secretary and even the Supreme Court.
Aside from the PDAF scam, the case of Vhong Navarro was there that he thought it was just showbiz but a deep issue is included in the need to know and understand the country.
The Bangsamoro agreement and the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) is there between the Philippines and America with the smell of debate that may be filed by the Supreme Court.
There is a charter change, the issue between China through the destruction of territory in the ocean and even the issue of electricity that involved the giant businesses such as Meralco, and others.
Goodluck to all of us!
