She should be kicked out of lazy, no use.
Bailagutan, July 23, 2016.
Two Labor laws in Saudi Arabia were fired from the post of Labor Secretary Butch Abad's position because of the failure to fulfill their duties.
They are the ones, the Philippine Labor Attach√© in the Jeddah and the Riyadh Football Federation.
The Department of Labor (DOLE) secretary is extremely disappointed because of the two representatives of the government of the Philippines in Jeddah and Riyadh because they cannot solve even a smaller problem in the country where they are holding, and lost their jobs, Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW), because of the primary issues that they are facing in Saudi.
The number of OFWs stranded in Saudi Arabia already reached 11 but the primary problem is a trace of dogs or those waiting for salary from their former employers.
Oh, it is good that Sec. Bello is good and you have seen that problem with that kind of case where there are so many who are negligent but we are not doing their job.
There are also many of our country's representatives in different parts of the world who are accusing their office and do not follow their duties to take care of the needs of our countrymen who are working hard in other countries.
It is right that Sec. Bello is right, most of the problems of our fellow OFWs have only been a simple problem waiting for their salary and attention of our salary, that is why they do not have time with these kinds of problems, that is why the situation of our countrymen is becoming pitiful.
We know that there are a lot of negligent officials of the Philippine Consulate in different parts of the country and it should also be denied by Sec. Bello in order to remove those with no benefits and passion in the country where they are assigned in the country.
