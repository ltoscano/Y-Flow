Fight over the Sandiganbayan.

The decisions of lawyers, judge and Justice should have no personal decision on all the decisions of lawyers, judge and Justice but it was only three members of Fifth Division of the Sandiganbayan who just refused to go to the plunder case against Senator Jinggoy Estrada.
It is likely that they would reach the Supreme Court's decision if they would inhibit from the case of Jinggoy.
What are the three things that the three are saying?
Does not take care of all the cases held by lawyers and magistrate.
If the issue is personal, they should resign together.
They would inhibit and they would only inhibit and only have one reason and he is personal.
Are they a loser?
Is Jinggoy made a point out? He might not be because his stay in prison will become stronger.
Was the state prosecutor returned?
It is also likely that it is not because the government's efforts to finish the case at dawn will end up to nothing.
Jinggoy's case was back to square meters.
The hearing needs to be resolved again and the Sandiganbayan allowed the Sandiganbayan.
Derelegging on duty is the proposed punishment of Associate Justice Rolan Jurado, wheelchair of the anti-graft court's Anti-Kidnapping Group (chickenth Division and Associate Secretary Theresa Augustine Hermocilla.
For the First Division, this has happened in the whole court of the Philippines.
The eggplant was wrote to a one-year-page contribution to Presiding Justice Amparo Cabaje-Tyo, to say that they do not want to work for personal interests.
Money is the reason?
Is the reason?
What if all members of the Sandiganbayan decides to decide if they do not want to listen to the case of the accused about the P10-billion scam which was led by Janet Napoles, EP / Raul Videz.
