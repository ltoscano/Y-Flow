Recovery!: Reflection of the Solaura of the King of the King of C-November 24, 2013 - end of the SEA Games.

Recovery, this is what is predominant in the heart of our siblings who are devastated by typhoon Yolanda after the typhoon hit their house and are now ready again.
Which is very full of hope, it so happened that this is also what we are expecting as the only king of boxing where he is still here in reading, but after his huge failure, that is why we also see the desire of the thief beside Jesus, which is why we saw the desire of a person beside Jesus.
Again and made up for many mistakes in life, how can we do that with the strength of our body, we are hoping that we will be ready for the sake of our body, that is why we are hoping that we will be able to ask for help from our fellowmen, that is why we are hoping that we will be able to ask for help from our lives.
