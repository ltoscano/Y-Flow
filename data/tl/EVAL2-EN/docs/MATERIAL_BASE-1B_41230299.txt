CBCP appealed to the anti-drug killings, Noel Abuan on August 6, 2016.
The catholic bishops conference of the Philippines (CBCP) is calling the government to strive to solve poverty in the country instead of killing those suspected to be involved in illegal drugs.
This is the appeal of Sorsogon Bishop Arturo Bastes, chairman of CBCP Eve, Commission on duty related to the continuous rise of number of those who were killed in the campaign of the police against illegal drugs in the country.
According to him, because of the poverty experienced in life, the people are pushing and are forced to sell or use illegal drugs especially those who are in the bottom of the society, according to him they should not have to kill the suspects instead of having a new life.
Bastes added that the government should be given a livelihood for those who have surrendered to each other so that somehow they can forget their poverty and will be the payment for the daily expenses.
Based on the report of the Philippine National Police, from July 1 to August 4, 2016, around 460 were killed in the campaign against illegal drugs in the whole country.
While the suspects on drugs have reached more than half a million who voluntarily surrendered to the authorities in the whole country.
