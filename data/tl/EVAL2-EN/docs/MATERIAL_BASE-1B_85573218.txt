Our New Year to the christians here is the first week of AdEstevan, this is a year-law in liturgy, the time of our preparation in our country with His holiness and expensive Pope Francis on January 15, 2015.
Again the Day is opening to expect hope because we will save our life, pray that we will save our life, let us go down to the heavens, "let us go down from Him."
Now is our happy preparation in the birthday of his first year since it is also time for us to fix our hearts and minds in the second arrival of Jesus Christ, "this is the time when we are in the Lord of Jesus."
That's why in the evangelists, Jesus said that in our waiting of our relationship, we should take care of us by God and we never know that we will not be forsaken by God and we will never know that we will fulfill it and do our backs.
Let us do well what is given to us so we can get ready for us to get ready because we do not know his arrival at night or sleeping, in the morning or sleeping.
