Dumbfounded.

The Talk 'Text Tropang Texters against Rain or Shine will win at the caer, 99 to 92 last Wednesday at the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay City.
For the game, it will be recalled that the Tropang Texters caught the Tropang Texters of Rain or Shine, 7-6.
After that, the Tropang Texters has been controlled by the Tropang Texters against Tempo of the game and was able to post 13 points, who will be able to talk about.
Eve, Palagtingan, who reached the finals, through 3-0 fight against Meralco to the semis, were able to catch up in the fourth period on the back of the heroism of those who stole the Tropang Texters against five points, 87-82 years old.

De Ocampo was the appointed vice player of the game after the end of 24 points, but these were once implemented on 11-free school.
That is why coach Joseller "Yeng" Tali√±o Mendoza wants to get a good appeal to his children from the start of Game Two so that what happened to the Pambansang Kamao will not happen again.
He is hoping that Paul Lee will be able to get back well with the bad rating of Game One Direction, Beau Belga, Junior Quinta and Ryan Arana.
