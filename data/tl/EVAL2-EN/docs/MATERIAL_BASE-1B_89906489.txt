Pacquiao for President.

I do not know if I should be happy or sad about the defeat of Manny Pacquiao with Floyd Mayweather, Jr.
Pacquiao is a congressman, singer, actor, Lieutenant Colonel, and Captain's Army.
Before their fight in the fight of the CEuphrasia Eve, Pacquiao said he wants to run for the presidency of the Philippines.
Manny, it is just the weather condition, and if you will meet with the boxer, you might be blamed for the number of punches in the head that you will pretend to add to your enemies and may not push through your dream of becoming a president.
Look at what happened to Delammad Ali.
He does not want to stop the boxer so he always loses.
It will also be consumed during the number of his earnings in boxing, it is time to take care of his health.
Go ahead, if you are paralyzed, you will immediately get retired from Lt. Col. Colonel Antonio, you will not accept the military or the police.
It is unreasonable, President Noynoy Aquino is right to retire, Manny, while you are healthy and no disease.
The only problem is, there are people who have no regard for honor and money.
Just stay for congressman or senator and you might even be the president since you reach the right age.
But when you were amazed, all your happiness was finished.
Pacquiao said, his arm was hurt so he defeated Pretty Boy Floyd Junior that's why he was not able to be buried alone.
Manny's feet slowed down, he became ill-tempered because he could no longer be able to talk and become a person who is like Ali or.
Floyd is now more irritating to feed the pro-Manny.
