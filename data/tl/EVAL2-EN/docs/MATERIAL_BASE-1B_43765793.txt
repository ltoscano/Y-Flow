2015 National budget, passed by us!

About 300 pages has been done by the Department of Budget and Management Council of the pork barrel scam, Janet Lim-Napoles, which is Secretary Butch Abad, is asking for an additional fund for the 2015, about 1.635 degrees east)!
Well, Mister Butch Abad, where will you bring the money of Juan and Maria dela Cruz?
Almost past in Congress is what you asked for the fund, for you to ask for P23-billion for the victims of typhoon Yolanda and the rehabilitation of LRT 1 and LRT 2, what are the next thing that you are asking for?
There is no doubt, Malaca単ang is looking for a huge amount of funds for the national and other citizens but for the questionable programs.
"Why not?
It is painful at PPPP, the involved businessmen who are involved are the legitimate businessmen and contractor is over, President Aquino himself had a cell in Calamba, Laguna Expressway or CAAP).
Malaca単ang is asking for more attention to those who are going to do a Expressway around Laguna, Quezon to Quezon to Bicol.
It is proven that almost all government agencies in PNoy's regime seems to be in a hurry to ask for a billion pesos worth of projects, that's why it's only on their first day in Malaca単ang that they are full of arrogance in the projects they will do to Malaca単ang.
It is also intense for the PR or public bastion now that just like the Agriculture Secretary Proceso Alacons, who are forcing the production of agriculture, especially in rice, are you not ashamed of what you are saying, Mister Alcala?
That is also the DOTC, BOC, DPWH and almost all agencies of the government, in front of their request.
But do not worry, "the offer to additional salary or compensation of those who are given to them are surprised!
Or, it is Christmas for a few million pesos that's why the bonus of the government agency is again for a few million, like a GSIS eCard, SSS, MWCCO and a lot of people who will be with PNoy's girlfriend?
