Max Santiago pointed out for the country.
The final State of the Nation Address of the Marcos regime is scheduled to be faced by the regime of 2016 to continue the "straight path"
But the country is not right, "it is right to end it!" The people who are suffering from the more than five years of the administration of President Aquino, will be removed.
And while the sun is running, the crimes that are happening in the town-anomaly, corruption, violation of human rights, poverty, corruption, price of commodities, the total price of goods, the full price of goods, the total price of filipinos would increase in order to reveal all his sins.
This is the reason why the call of different sectors of society to oust Aquino, instead of being silent and just wait for the upcoming election.
According to the failure and concern of this, Aquino himself made the widespread protest in the SONA of Luzon until Mindanao that's why he's also going to make the crack on the ranks of those taking a very kind, for the former allies like Binay, which has been lessened in him.
Which is why Aquino should do, the removal from protests during the time of the SONA is to protect the removal of him.
There is no effect on the surveys and its harassment of the regime, similar to the attempt by the agents and hands of the military recently to threaten, to arrest and protect the masses and members of the anomalous organization - will not stop the masses to lower down Aquino in position.
However, whoever wants to run for President Aquino to run as president in the upcoming elections will start and he will reap the anger of the people in the regime, he will wake up to the truth that it is not a crown to explode in his face.
And Aquino, whatever happens he will not be saved from the filipino people who are screaming for justice, Manong, she will experience the cold prison bars in prison.
