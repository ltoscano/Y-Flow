Bulang Malinao, October 18, 2016.
The weather is just like flying.
It has only been three weeks and the burial fight of Senator Manny Pacquiao will happen against the Meeting / American, Jessie Vargas last November 5 in Las Vegas.
Pacquiao tried to get a 38 years old from a 17 years old to recover the World welterweight title which was lost when he defeated Mayweather Mayweather, Jr. last May 2, 2015.
Just a few weeks have passed, his / her sister-for-law has already released a resolution that Pacquiao is one of the most prominent who want to face the top of the ring.
Mayweather also said particularly the speed of Pacquiao's movement and even the strength of its punches are being taken from his opponents.
Many are happy with the statement of Mayweather because for them, this is a sign that the news about his rematch with Pacquiao in 2017 will happen.
That is why Freddie Roach is strictly reminding the training of Pacquiao because the performance of its performance against WBO welterweight champion Vargas is needed.
In the latest news of Pacquiao's training, Roach said that the condition of his child is in order.
It is said that there is also no need to worry about the crabulary that has happened to the senator while on the past week.
