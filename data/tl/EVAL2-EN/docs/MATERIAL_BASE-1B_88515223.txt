So let us continue the corruption in the local government.
According to him July 15, 2016, we are happy with the cleaning of President Rodrigo Duterte to the drug pushers in our country, hopefully they should not just be killed and be given proper investigation.
The challenge now for Duterte and the Philippine National Police (PNP) is to catch and be useful in the big syndicates and people behind those involved in illegal drugs in our country.
Until they will not catch and hold the law against these big people, it cannot be said that the fight of the current administration against illegal drugs should be considered successful because some of the big people who are becoming a protector of illegal drugs in our country are leaders of the local government like Mayor and governor.
They should be charged and suspended for these leaders who are involved in illegal drugs in their area, the future of our youth are at stake, that is why we cannot back down from it.
Another thing that Duterte should focus on is to continue the worsening corruption in the local government where the businessmen are being choked and mistreated just to get a business permit and other documents that needed to be ran into their business.
Instead of having a hard time, local government should also help the businessmen because if they have a business in their area, "if there is a job, the poor and starving in our society may be lessened.
The problem is that our leaders are just thinking about themselves and not the welfare of the majority of this is what my friend experienced in a big city here in Metro Manila where he was asked for more than 5,000 pesos to give him a business permit.
Because of this incident, he could not allow the opening of business that is why almost 200 of the jobs that he will open up in the area will be wasted, until there is nonsense and corruption in our government.
