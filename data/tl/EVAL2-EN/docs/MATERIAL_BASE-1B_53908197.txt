Discipline.
Bell Junila, September 18, 2016, we are always hear the progress of the country, discipline what is needed by former President Ferdinand Marcos and the reason of Martial Law.
For me, discipline is one of the most effective solution to free the traffic in the streets, if Filipino drivers will only have discipline, and hopefully we can reach the traffic, and hopefully we can reach what we want to go to.
But are we going to close our themselves?
It means that even if it means an equivalent result, an equivalent result will be an equivalent result and it should be according to the law's law.
For example, if you do bad, you should be punished and if you do good, you should be given a reward.
In discipline, there is also a need for violation of traffic laws.
There is a need to be naughty when you are stubborn on the road.
And there is a need to be appreciated to what you want to say, if it is wrong for one, it should also be wrong for others, and that he will be punished for others.
That's why we are not qualified, because we know that we can stop the punishment, and we also know that those who implement the law will not be implemented.
We should just take advantage of the traffic rules and even if we will be disciplined, we will also close the Filipinos.
One of the most disciplined country when driving is Japan, but do you know that they did not start anew like they are now disciplined, and now that they are disciplined, started after the World War.
How do they do this?
We hope that we start in our time to change the Filipino's time to always end.
