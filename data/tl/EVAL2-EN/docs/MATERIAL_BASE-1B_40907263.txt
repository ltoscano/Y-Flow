Admirable is Aziza.

I am really envious of the citizens of South Korea.
Because they have a leader who really has a real concern for his countrymen.
And most of all, a leader with real delicadeza.
Leader who does not feel thick, does not know how to be ashamed.
Also in Japan, the officials of the government of Japan will be involved in corruption and lost faith in him and his town has committed suicide.
"What should I call him?
Let's go back to South Korea - Prime Minister Chambers (IG) to resign from his position in relation to the destruction of a ship recently which killed hundreds of people.
His attempt to resign was announced in front of TV to the public that he admitted the responsibility for the slow response of the government to rescue operation against the victims.
Up to 187 will be the full recovery of the corpse in the sunken ship while 115.
And admirable is, he asked forgiveness to the citizens of South Korea.
PM Chance is close to the officials of our country.
This was touched by the face of those in our government, it was said it was said to be maintained and led to him.
If he will escape, the damn is really needed to let them escape from the negligence and foolishness, they do not want to resign.
In the Yolanda Disaster, officials of the Philippines will be consumed if they will follow PM Chance.
Yolanda revealed the negligence and failure of the Aquino government.
What is painful, many officials of the government are using the tragedy to earn.
First of course with PNoy, DILG Secretary Mar Roxas and DSWD Sec. Dinky Soliman is second.
But this is PNoy, Roxas and Soliman, with no delicadeza.
Similar to them are the senators who are plunderer of funds of the country, these people, even if they get angry, just to be crazy and laughing.
They say they would not be leaving let go of the thickness of his face!
