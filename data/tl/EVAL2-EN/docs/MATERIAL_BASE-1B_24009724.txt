Praises for the police and military.

The whole country should give tribute to the criticism shown by the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police.
While we are writing this column, the focus on the fight between our military and police to the rebels who was captured in Zamboanga City was ongoing, we witnessed the bravery of the soldiers and police against the MNLF and Nur Misuari.
What is happening in Zamboanga City became the way for us to think that the soldier and police are important in times of need of many soldiers and policemen who risked their lives in more than a week fight in order to stop the attempt of held in Zamboanga City of this daring group of Misuari.
What is happening in Zamboanga City is saddening because the rebels attack are our fellow citizens, but of course, when we get the movement from the side of the military and police, not for our fellow MNLF.
"Of us," will there be a fight if the MNLF forces of Misuari will attack in Zamboanga City, something that is happening in the existing law, what they did is a direct insult to the Constitution in the country.
So what can we say - thank you to our fellow soldiers and police who are fighting in order to save the Zamboanga City in the dark plan of Misuari and his followers.
It is truly a nuisance.
The operation of the price of gasoline and diesel by "Emil" is ongoing, in Gapan that was stolen from the Contact Policy "according to the Police Community Precint-budol Gang, according to the police, Emil surfaces," the APD of the said province.
In Brgy. Mabog in Hermosa, Bataan, the heads of gasoline and diesel are still widespread, as well as with soy sauce as one alias "Blade."
What do S2 (intelligence) of the PD of Nueva Ecija and Bataan were doing, why did you stop the operation of Emil and Tugade.
Paging General Edgardo Ladao.
