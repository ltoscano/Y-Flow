The government is about to send 3 billion pesos to the bidding of MRT 3 for its trains.
According to DOTC Sec. Jun Abaya, this is the amount of waste if they chose the controversial 48 coaches from the Ieking Group (Needt) that is because of this.
This amount, which can be used for other programs, can be used for other programs to improve the public service, "Abaya said.
This is said to be a part of his reform, and good upbringing by the DOTC.
This issue is complicated because many commandos were delayed in the order of the new trains and there are also allegations that they will not get the project after they refuse the proposed 30 million peso bribe from some officials of the government.
Abaya denied this that he was not put in a acadversary, they even invited him to join the bidding but he did not show up even if the MRT bought from an administrative and transparent bidding for the new MRT coach.
The bidding is one of the reforms implemented by DILG Secretary Mar Roxas when he was still the DOTC to prevent the price hike which is usually happening with the bidding.
That is why it turns out that this is what happened to both sides that are thrown by the accusation and you are going to judge who is telling the truth.
For me, maybe the government can save for the quality of train that are not delayed in the arrival of the needed trains of MRT.
"Like now, the service or operation of the MRT are increasing because of the pitiful condition of our trains.
Yes, even if only half of the video machines has only been half of the video der, the One 33355 million of Iheals for every coach Chot, "didn't it be recovered" if it will decrease the burden caused by its construction?
