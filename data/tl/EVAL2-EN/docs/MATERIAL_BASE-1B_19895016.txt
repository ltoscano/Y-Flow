20 percent for students wanted to be made into law, Tina Mendoza August 28, 2016.
Quezon City 5th District Representative Alfred Vargas wants to make a law the giving of 20 percent that should be implemented by students and impose heavier penalties to anyone who will not follow this.
As of now, 20 percent in fare should only be stated in LTFRB Circus in the filed House Bill Number 72 at Vargas which he insisted that the giving of stories on students should be clear in the law.
In his proposal, all students can receive 20 percent in all kinds of public Transportation inside a year with this, which is why there is no more story when Holy Week and summer breaks.
Also encourages the proposal to complain in the fare, if Land Transportation Office is set to complain, to the complaint of the LTFRB, in the Office of the local chief executive in the complaints against the tricycle, Civil Defense Cooperation or legal service of the Department of Transportation and the legal service of the Department of Transportation for the Light Rail Transit and legal services of the Department of Transportation.
