I did not report it, Dr. Love, By Bernard Taguba, November 25, 2016 Wagas, real and honest, this is how Ronnie Dayan described the love of Senator Leila de Lima but this is why he was not able to make it as a love. "
In the interrogation of House Speaker Fred Castro, Dayan gave birth to her that he loved and love what he felt at de Lima inside the seven-year relationship of the two.
"It seems like that, Sir," said Dayan when she was asked by Castro when she was asked towards de Lima but because she was not able to make her love to de Lima, but because she was not able to make her ex-mannered family.

"It depends on the situation because, in my love, she was not able to make your love affair with the sake of the law that is why I consider her head, for the sake of the truth," said Dayan.
When other lawmakers asked if he still loves de Lima, there is no evidence for Dayan to answer, "that is no one of the love" that is. "
In his affidavit, Dayan said that he first worked with de Lima as a driver / bodyguard last 2007, wherein he had a lawyer and after two to three months, their relationship started.
"The second child of Ma'am, our relationship, Ma'am, I know that I already have a wife for those times when I am married since I am married since I am going crazy as a driver of the security of Ma'am," said Dayan.
But before the 2016 came, Dayan and De Lima were also fired.
"Because we will not be happy with our relationship because when I heard about it," when I heard that the name is Warren Cristobal, like I felt that Ma'am, "said Dayan slightly," said Dayan.
"I said that," you might use all your security, ah, "Dayan added.
