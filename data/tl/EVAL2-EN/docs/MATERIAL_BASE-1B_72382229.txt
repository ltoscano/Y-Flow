Politics is in blood.

In the middle of the discussion among those who are devastated by the political dynasty, one thing will hit our minds: Is it possible to separate them?, I think it is still far from the possibility.
It has been thirty years since our Constitution, who is leading the provisions against political dynasty, but until now there is no direct law for it to be implemented.
The question is, who will form the proposed law, who else are the lawmakers, but how it is a source of a law to get along with the law if they are the ones who will be affected?
In the span of three decades of our Constitution, this issue is clearly avoided by lawmakers, why many of them have families of Family, who are going to make the electoral duties especially to the local level.
Politics is in the blood, it is natural that if there is a politician in the family, it is likely that other members will probably have their ambition to enter.
It is existing that there is a trend that kind of trend even if the Filipinos are aware of politics, that's why it's as if it's hard to remove the blood that is lacking in politics.

Not all the clan of politicians are bad, there are also those who are taking advantage of their duty to serve the country, but it cannot be denied that there are many political leaders who are taking advantage of them and they can also do whatever they welcome.
The old saying was said to be the old saying: The Power Revolution was given absolute freedom. "
It is possible that the power is far, if you are on top of the top, you do not want to resign from your position, you will prepare that your children are good, not all are good because there are also those who are serving in their own place.
