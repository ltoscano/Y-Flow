The regime of PNoy is very rich.

Based on the basis of Ibon Foundation, a non-government organization used to take advantage of the flow of the economy of the country, all the administration from Don Emilio Aguinaldo of Cavite up to the former President and now Pampanga Representative Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.
Using the huge calculator and data, peanuts and they are really weak from the issue of funds and the annual budget of the country that is now of P2.663-Tropas that's why you can handle it?
In the thing, even before, the price of expensive expenses that is not like now, thousands have already been used to buy it as if it is said that it is an strength of Samson and Hercules, the one who bought!
If in the last three months of the administration, they are asking for hundreds of millions in their budget before, change the officials of President Benigno Aquino 3rd right now, that is what every agency is asking for 7 billion pesos!
It is scary to think about the offer of each agency of the DILG Secretary Mar Roxas, DSWD Sec. Dinky Soliman, using the face of the poor in his post, which reached more than 50 billion pesos.
That is despite the missing funds from the contribution of the countries for the victims of typhoon Yolanda.
DOTC Secretary Jun Abaya is also asking for P54 billion to buy the MRT for the government just to buy the train of MRT because of the negligence of the DOTC, you will buy, Mister Abaya?
Are you not happy at 60-million pesos every month of your party mates in dealing with a Global Dengant which is contractor of MRT but no things, no ability and not doing anything but to collect it, is there really no embarrassment in your life?
Almost all agencies of the government in the regime of Aquino are not corrupt who will ask for their budget is full of billions.
Is the million?
