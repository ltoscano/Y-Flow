So UNA is confused?

Many are asking if United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) is still confident that Mayor Erap Estrada, VP Jojo Binay and Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, are still complete.
Because of the new events in politics, it is clear that the UNA and Binay are very crying because the root is clear in politics in 2016.
The issue of Central Market in Manila became part of the separation of the two pillars of the opposition but it is clear that Erap had the attempt to fight back to the 2016 Supreme Court.
It is clear that what happened to the UNA is clear so it is certain that the landslides will continue and that is a sign that it cannot be avoided because it is going to run towards it.
In a short word, so UNA and that are what Mar Roxas is waiting for because it is possible that he has a chance in order in 2016 because of having two stories of the opposition.
Um!
Do Filipinos win in EDSA? Many say that Filipinos still remain silent after 28 years from the EDSA Revolution in 1986.
This is what the majority of the citizens in the country are feeling, because the poor are only getting along well and the rich will improve the situation.
Even the people in politics are before, before EDSA, they are still the ones who gave their positions in the government for now, which is only one proof that the EDSA Revolution of Cory Aquino really failed.
In a short word, the person who had the position and fear of the country of the country is still there, that is why it is still there, the continuous action of the government is noticeable.
It is possible that there will be EDSA that will come but if Filipinos do not change to people who are elected in position, it is certain that the people are still surprised because we are just instruments in the continuous corruption in the government.
