Scorpio (TIDs of DINJ.

They are enemies of evil and allies in their goodness if they treat their own lives and dignity is at stake, how can we live in a proper state of America?
In Chicago, USA, I met the Filipinization of Edwin Dantes and only a child, he dreamed of becoming a police and his inspiration is his father and other relatives who are also in this line.
Because of his dream, Edwin decided to go to a vacant school when she was in college that's why he experienced the extreme training and studies to reach and fulfill his ambition.
After finishing, Edwin immediately went to the field where he was already three months old and was surrounded by his field training officer.
After he passed through the exam and training, he accepted and became part of an administrative unit where he will be hit in a Street crime program and that is where he experienced the cases related to drugs, gang, guns and other things related to violence.
He also mentioned that he also experienced being assigned as part of an extensive team in Chicago but he showed his dedication and love for his profession.
After nine years of giving and clean duty, Edwin is given a chance to have been charged and even in a camara, which is why he passed through another training at Academy.
As a Pambansang Kamao, more than a lot of crimes were held at him and for a long time in his work in the police force, Visayas has already been aware of his work, including the attitude of the common suspects and the opportunity to use them and the victims.
Because of the form of Edwin's job, it is not common to him the dangers he might bring to him and his family.
In the end of my interview with Edwin, he explained the reason why in spite of the big responsibility and dangers he is facing as a law of the law, "when we reported it to the people, then it will help the people," the end of his statement.
