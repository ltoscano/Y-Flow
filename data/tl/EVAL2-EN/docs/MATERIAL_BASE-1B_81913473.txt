A OFW like me who is far from me.

Christmas is the season where every family is living together in order to commemorate the birth of Christ, this is the time when you are far from your family especially if you are a Overseas Filipino Worker or OFW? How do you celebrate Christmas and how hard it is?

We will look into a video from the Usahay, which is really confusing the feelings of our fellow Filipinos or loved ones in another country, do you still remember them?

Christmas is near and for sure our family members will not forget their care.
Postanes and Pac Tantos, to 7, 2015.

This Christmas season, we should not forget that they are part of our Christmas because this is very important because this will continue their enthusiasm and skill at times when they are far from us.

Are you an OFW?
