The forces of Mario Corpuz Command (MCC-NPA-NPA) were disappointed by the military offensive of the AFP in the midst of General Nakar, Quezon last week of May 2013 when the members of the armed group in the mountains of North Quezon.

The forces of the NPA-North Quezon were brave to face the military offensive through the aid of the citizens and friends in the ranks of the 16th IB (PA), around 5: 25 in the afternoon, which resulted to the military forces that were conducting an operation.
On the past May 27, 2013, a Tim of MCC-NPA-NQ was held by an extensive supply of the 16th IB (PA) in the operation which was confiscated from the said operation which happened in Sitio Rao, Milan, Nakar, Quezon.

Because of this incident was derailed by the 16th IB-Tropas that they are trapped in the operation being taken by the NPA, it is certain that the NPA members will be disappointed with the ranks of the NPA, PNP-AFP), that they will surely be disappointed with any kind of military operations.
