Kris, did not abandon PDU 30 - Andanar By Boyet Jihadist, November 14, 2016.
After the actress and TV host Kris Aquino III said that President Rodrigo Duterte did not return to his statement on Friday, an official of Malaca√±ang clarified that the President did not neglect the actress.
According to Presidential Communications Office (NPC) Secretary Martin Andanar, it is just a coincidence that the President feels bad.
"He could not avoid any intention to be given by Kris Aquino.
"Anzon, 37 years old, became a parish priest," said Andanar.
