If not immediately declared.

Senator Bongbong Marcos is right when he did not declare his plan in the 2016 elections because he knows that he will be able to ensure that there is a lot of criticisms and searching for a loophole that will happen to him just to bring him down.
Once in his going to CAMANAVA), the journalists were able to talk with them and he made an example of President Noynoy Aquino that last 2009, he was only a senator but in an instant or after one year, he was the president of the Philippines.
I have been telling this because if Vice President Jojo Binay was not immediately declared with his ambition to become president, since he now smells good to the people and there is no question now that he will replace in the position of PNoy, that is why he sits on the position of PNoy.
But as long as there is still no heavy opponent, even if VP Binay will continue to rise in the survey, even if the number of his votes went down, it is natural for him to lead the latest President.
