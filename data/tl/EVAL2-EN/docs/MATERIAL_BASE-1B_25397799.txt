Congress cut the mind.

The right and right are President Benigno Aquino 3rd (BGH3) in the issue of money of the country's money which have been utilized for the program for progress but to the corrupt and DAP!
In the last statement of pork barrel scam, teacher Butch Abad in front of businessmen and allies in politics, the pork barrel in 2015 budget is no longer there in the 2015 budget, Tell that will be a teacher Butch!

Carry out of thinking, I mean, your term in Malaca√±ang is almost over, you are still full of flattery, therefore, all politicians are still full of capital because of the size of their profit.

If the flow of pork barrel in Congress is cut, there is no doubt, not only enough but the money is too much for the programs of every person and country.
"What the lawmakers are saying about their project from the pork barrel, it would be better for them to look into their new houses, expensive vehicles, funds in the bank and traveling outside the country.
When they were not in Congress, they are riding in the Congress, they will drink coffee and just asking for fare!
