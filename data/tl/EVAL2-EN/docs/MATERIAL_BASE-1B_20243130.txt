I am waking up: PhilHealth.

Let us report the complaint and complaint of a woman from tugatog, Malabon about the office of PhilHealth, who was in Commonwealth Avenue in Caloocan City.
In the complaint of Mrs. Amelita Tuazon in tugatog, there were 3 years that he was going to fall for his PhilHealth, but in an unexpected coincidence, he did not stop in 3 months because his income weakened.
When it took some time for Gng. Tumagay in the said office, he immediately went to the said office to pay what he did for the past 3 months and was also so that she could have just kept on top.
The woman wondered because he does not want to accept the reason why he is going to sleep with the reason that she needs to go back in the beginning, like before and he said that there was no 3 years that he had to sleep.
If this is the policy of PhilHealth, wow, how about the members who will fall for the members?
Will that be gone to waste, and if the woman will start paying that, how will he get sick?
Does this mean he can't use his PhilHealth because before he will not fall asleep?
Many of our countrymen are confused now in the rules being implemented by PhilHealth, why are you not going to put councilors in TV, radio and diologists so you will not be confused with our countrymen?
Or maybe PhilHealth will be saved and regret what they will pay for, so I will open our country for your response to the complaint and complaint of Mrs. Tuazza.
Kindly answer, Mrs. Tumagay in the right Rules and policies of PhilHealth.
