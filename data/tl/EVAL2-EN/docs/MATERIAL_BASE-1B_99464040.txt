Jaye Sebastian, in the hearing of the House By Juliet, Loza-Cudia, September 26, 2016 will be able to attend the next hearing of the House Committee on justice.
This is what Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre assured yesterday that it is possible that it is possible to force it if it won't be followed.
"If you say that he is a hidden talent, if he does not want to follow it, it's likely that it would be done to him by the House Committee for Sebastian and Sebastian was the first accused of giving money to his fellow inmates in order to become a fund for Senator Leila de Lima.
"If it is not a subpoena, the head of the Department of Justice (DOJ) needs to be required that's why they do not have the right to refuse them," according to Aguirre.
Aguirre also clarified that Sebastian is not the witness of DOJ and he has no idea what Sebastian will say in the hearing of the House Committee on Justice in the next hearing.
"" I can't think that he might be a big sister of two things that he can do: Tell the truth or tell her lies, "said Aguirre.
De Lima first said that Sebastian is a government agency that they do not believe.
"If I will be allowed to ask, pass the cross and examination, I think that we will be able to save even if it is to show that the truth with Sebastian," the Secretary added.
It was found out that the legislative chamber's hearing was back on October 5 after President Rodrigo Duterte visited Vietnam in the coming September 27-30.
