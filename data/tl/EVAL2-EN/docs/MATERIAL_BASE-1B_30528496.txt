Should be held accountable.

Since the Supreme Court declared last July 1 that was against the Supreme Court (DAP), there have been a lot of reports and said that these are critical in his speech in the television last July 14, and the approval of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement), the biggest controversy in the regime of Aquino.
Their basis is strong in the implementation of DAP in the year 2011, 2013, Senator Jinggoy Estrada revealed the 50-million peso bribe from the Congress to set a national budget, particularly in controlling the international budget, and acceptance of the executive leader of the Congress which should be held by former Chief Justice Renato Corona.
(3) in the actual case, the pork barrel of Aquino is used for DAP, instruments of corruption and political language, this should be denied that the regime is implemented on the impeachment of Corona and the report that Aquino continues to implement and show up for the mistakes that is clear to many and increasing in the country.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of reports and mentioned by the lawyers of DAP and the Marcos regime, but they are not strong that there will be no solid argument and anger of Aquino, the professor was running out of defense, the professor was running out of defense, that the professor was running out, which led to the insult.
Similar to an example is the revelation of the regime that has helped the economy of the country and DAP, which can help the economy the pouring of funds of the government, and it should be extended to the economy the pork barrel such as DAP, and the economy is not progressing the economy, and the economy is not progressing.
Because there is a strong basis for those who are critical of the DAP and regime, they are growing up, even though she was still widespread in social media, even though she was still widespread in social media, even though she was added to the Supreme Court, he tried to respond to the Supreme Court and give the defense in the regime.
It is a good symptoms of this period the law of the art of art of the art of art-Arroyo who supported Aquino.
