Please do not judge, i'll take it down.

If I am PNoy, it's a mother, I will turn down Butch Abad.
But I just cannot deny it, I will kick out him when it is strong in the palace.
Well, this is his mother.
This is the architect of the Disbursement Acceleration Program which is held by the Supreme Court.
But wait, why will I turn down and will kick out Abad?
It seems that it was clear that Abad signed all the funds given to DAP.
Clothing, clothing!
Maybe, when I punched Abad and thrown out of Malacanang, it is bad that I can fly out, clothing, clothing, and clothing!
What should I do, duh?
Hated, "when there is still time, thank you!
But what if, the bullets are flying in anywhere to chase and Abad.
Someday from gunshots, people who are mad at the released and accepted DAP were from the gunshots.
They were about to lie down, what should I do?
But before I did it violent, where did the anger of the people come from?
"Anyway, since I am calling me" Boy, "stand for me.
It is because these are creeping, the judges in the Supreme Court.
Why are these opposing the toys to the toys at first "the Priority Development Assistance Fund and, second, this DAP?
Those who have no debt of gratitude.
Especially when I put the SC to be the judge.
Hey, they are not a judge if I do not have a judge.
But why is it that even if they are traitor?
On PDAF, 14-0-1 will vote for DAP, 13-0-1.
Why are they attacking me, duh?
Ah, that, they are the source of my suffering.
Just wait a sec, isn't it that there is a press coming from the warehouse of the ATM card?
Isn't it that there are corrupt and corrupt cops?
Wait a sec, "Atong Corona is from the SC, a!
I was kicked out by Corona from lying on his Severe Acting which affects the Netsmen.
Maybe Corona also has a twin, aside from strangulation on the division.
Or your followers, prepare, let us make the judge again to stop the voyeurism he did to us in the cases of Eehek!
