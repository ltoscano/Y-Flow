The check was ignored.

Aksyon Ngayon "by Al G. this is an action.

Today, the corruption of policemen who are involved in crimes will be exposed again, Interior and Local Government Secretary Mar Roxas will conduct a check in all officials and members of the police.
Manang Sabel approves of it and it's good that, if it was the time of President Cory Aquino, I heard that if in the salary of the government, this is a big sacrifice compared to if you will work in a private corporation.
That is fine with me so that there will be no movement and institution that will not change even if there will be a president of the country, this is always raining again when there are corruption happening like this, and the police who are involved are involved.
I do not want to think bad, but it is possible that these kinds of steps against corruption because there are new orders that they want to benefit from corruption because when it is too late, then it is time to start a standing and to attack the corruption happening.
This is even used as political issues to destroy the politicians from each other.
With the number of huge issues of this issue, the issue on the pork barrel scam and DAP were not being discussed.

Now that it is approved by the Palace, it will go to Roxas, go, go, but like what I said, do it to the institution, it should be done in spite of the changes in the leadership, that is always waiting for the guards.
I am sorry for English "related to the people we trusted to feel better but they themselves are plague to society, but they themselves have to be thought of aside from the guards.
With the plan to be put in the administration, do not just do it to PNP as if it is just in the agency that all corruption will be done.
