"Senator" Walis.

There is no retreat from the friend of the town, Valenzuela City Representative Sherwin "We" Gatchalian for his plan to be a senator in the election 2016.
Maybe at the right time, Cong. We will also have the right timing to become a senator in the country because if only a public service we can say it's ugly to him and the proof of this is the progressive and peaceful city of Valenzuela.
Three years or in the whole year, the city's father, Cong. Wu, was able to show how to be his servant-country who is full of dedication and has no one of personal interests, which is why the city has accepted the city under his leadership.
Of course, his younger sibling who is currently the mayor of the city will not be defeated, because of its severe inspiration and concern for his sibling, it is almost as if it is only for more than a year in his position, the people and the city of Valenzuela!
It can be considered a child if his age is being discussed, but it is at its experience as a sensible and good public service.
Your servant - together with his colleagues from Camanava for a public service, is sure that the people will become a senator in 2016 but, as well as Mayor Rex and his younger sibling Representative Wes Gatchalian, and the next representative of District 1 of the city.
Hopefully, we will be better to be observant and be intelligent that we let a few who became a senator but all just laugh at the newspaper and all just acting cute, but in truth, the tax of people in the country is a waste.
Congressman We, as a senator, is sure that the country will win as a proof, it is not the press of it!
