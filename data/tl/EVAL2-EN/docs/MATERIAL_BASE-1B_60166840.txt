PO 1, my God, is Pasay BPLO chief for Vice Mayor?

The 2016 National elections is getting closer, so many don't depend on anything, right?) or desperate that we are seeing.
Each has their own ways or style of what they did just to notice the voters that they will run.
Just like in Pasay City Business Permits, Licensing chief Noel or Boyet del Rosario, who will run as vice mayor of Pasay.

It's because Boyet, is a different kind, he has a strong feeling well, as they say, he has its own form, "right?
If you can remember it, even before the BPLO chief Mang Boyet or Noel, it will only be the rent of Mayor Calixto to be the chief of BPLO.
Hey, the candidacy for vice mayor in a city is not only one million peso for the expenses of a candidate here but one hundred million pesos.
The question: Where is it going to win, I mean, Del Rosario will get the money that he will spend on his studies in the 2016 National Elections?
Do you not want to say that Mister Boyet is going to get the spend of his earnings, "I mean, to his hard work in ALL Office.

Well, Mister Boyet will not permit that just as long as they are just like that (TIDs), when it is just like that he is the closest ones in its condition, which is why he's the one he can take.
Just, I know my mother, "I am not saying that he is drunk!
