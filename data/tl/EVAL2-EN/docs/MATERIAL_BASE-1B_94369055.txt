"EDick, okay?
By Rose Garcia November 29, 2016.
Our gratitude is personal thanks to the two Kapuso Stars, most of their actors are their christians by how, they are going to share their time and faith in expressing their acquaintance with the Lord.
We have been trying to talk to each other once if they would agree to be a part of Aaahh.C. in Bataan and we did not need to think twice, in separate times, they almost have an answer, "for the Lord."
Bettina also shared how he became a Christian, in this time, she was still pregnant at this 5-year-old daughter, she was already pregnant, she was already pregnant for being a young lady, she will still be able to go back to an extraordinary woman, besides, he / she was going to be able to return to being an old person, aside from being a business partners.
She is so lucky that maybe one day, we will not be surprised if she will have a pastor who has not denied it to be a pastor.
But he / she really hurts, what will happen is, an only God Can. Prayer, he is also the one who will be given by God to have a new partner and be given a sibling.
Like Bettina, Joross Gamboa, together with his wife, Katz Saga-Gamboa, often share and care of their faith as well, which is why she said that it was too late because she did not do anything like drinking and womanizing.
They were already at a point when his wife would separate now that and in-time, he live with him, but when he accepted it, it was true that they came from their sex until they got married.
Nevertheless, it is also good that it came from the basketball game in Subic and it is sure that his birthday is going to go home on the road going home to Para√±aque since his / her birthday.
Almost everyone of the Blessed Virgin on what they were doing is really gladdening, that in spite of their being a child, "the fans are admiring them, but the Lord is raising them.
