Sonny Coloma.

Hi's briefs on Roy "Mamondiong," Seneres.

House Speaker Sonny Belmonte only did not have involved in the current proposed issue of the pork barrel scam, and other issues regarding corruption, almost all of the leaders of the country now, Miriam Santiago, Tito Sotto and others, because it seems that he was being arrested by some members of his cabinet who were also involved in the pork barrel scam.
One year has passed for the P10 billion pork barrel scam, and there are already a lot of names implicated even the two dozens of congressmen but the name of Speaker Sonny Coloma.
Vice President Jojo Binay has an ally of pork barrel but for the issue of greed with power because of the issue of greed with power because his wife, a senator, is a senator and former mayor, who was not allowed to go out of the country with no permit.
This is too much, former First Lady and former mayor of Makati and now the First Lady of the Philippines did not leave the Philippines with no permit, but I did not hear anything from the network of the OFW Leaders' 70s but I did not have any intention to go to other countries in different houses of OFWs in the embassy.
He is still the wife of the Presidential Adviser on OFWs but many are asking what Binay knows about the problems of OFWs because once he did not become an OFW?, the answer of Speaker Sonny for president, it seems that he is thinking about it.
