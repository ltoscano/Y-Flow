Fidel Castro: Revolution.

Through a hidden station of the radio in the mountains of Sierra Maesmari, he is impressed by the citizenry who ran off and will be forced to burn down it, and just like a fire that's being ran off, "and it seemed like a fire that has been pushed by Fidel" Cfur, and it is like a fire that has been taken off by Fidel "Cbosity," and it seemed like a fire that has been taken off by Fidel "C."
You can't ensure that the honest goal and dedication of Fidel Castro to free the filipino masses, but also in the welfare of the Filipino people, who are all over the poor people, are not only for the sake of the majority of ordinary citizens, but also for the sake of the majority of ordinary citizens, but also for the sake of the majority of ordinary citizens, but also for the sake of the majority of ordinary citizens.
At that time - as well as in the Philippines today, Fidel has seen the clear situation of Cuba, "they know no one can expect from the politicians who do not expect anything from the politicians who know no one can expect from the politicians who are living in favor of the politicians who are living in favor of the politicians who are living in favor of the politicians who are living in favor of the politicians.
"The hundreds of families who are living on the clumsy, in any roof, from a vacant lot, or are paying high price in their rented house, or in the end, the people who are paying to go out in school are still unemployed, and in the end, those who suffered a very high prices instead of their long miserable situation will also know this.
"The citizens know that hundreds of pesos are being taken out of the country by foreign businessmen, as well as the hundreds of millions worth of rich countries in America, nobody is able to die from hunger, no one knows how to die from hunger, no one knows how to die, no one knows how to die, and no beggars."
Fidel: "We also emphasized, that we have not allowed the gang of politicians who have no concern or interest to have no interest in the name of the people, but instead, they keep any support to the citizens; and instead, they keep our own hunger and fear, and there is no peace in the past four years."
Fidel also added that the politicians are the only ones of the politicians, especially during the time of election, especially in the other hand, the Filipino people who have no job are cut off, and the entire world, while the filipino masses, "and the entire world," meanwhile, Fidel, added.
What is really the difference between Cuba in the Philippines now?
Even if the dictator is defeated by the dictator, Fukushima Dencio Pacu, through the straight path that Fidel Castro, Che Guevasion and other courageous corruption in the land, cleaning the government against the former widespread corruption, and need to make the proper justice for all, until they take care of the rights violations of the people.
Even if the United States against Cuba has not surrendered, especially in the field of human rights, he was said to have been implemented by the administration of former President Bill which is said to have been implemented by the government of human rights, according to former President Clinton in the United States, according to former President Clinton in the United States, according to former President Clinton in the United States, according to former President Clinton in the United States.
In the Philippines, through the widespread protest by the citizens who celebrated EDSA 1 (not a revolution in our opinion), aside from the incessant violation of human rights like what happened in Cuba, which happened under the regime of the dictator, Fotoplay.
The Marcos dictatorship, but it hurts, is painful and saddening, there is no connection between the basic needs of the citizens especially against the Saligang Batas and progressive in the Constitution, which is being filed by the national leaders of the political administration, which is why there is already been charged by the national leaders under the constitution and progressive countries, which is why, most of disgusting corruption, is conquered by the national leadership, which is why the others were left behind by the national corruption, and most of disgusting anomalies, and most of disgusting anomalies, just as long as the others were killed.
The reforms are still limited to the land, the filipino masses, ate the families of the workers, farmers and other ordinary citizens who are all victims of contagious for Filipino Workers and other ordinary citizens who are all victims of influential people and other parts of the world.
On the other hand, the country's fund is exported back to the sweat and blood of the citizens, and contrary to the grace of the politicians in power to sell the Philippines, most of them are the indigenous people in power of the Philippines, most of them are Cuisa.
Even if there are politicians, what else should the Filipino masses have to expect that, who among the politicians, who are not corrupt and other politicians, who are not corrupt and does not have any corrupt and corrupt politicians, who are in power?
Or, God of Abrile, is it expected that the filipino masses will still be expecting from the leaders of the politicians in the Philippines, like Fidel Castro, who is true that these politicians are going to support the national welfare, "as if they hike in shame and destruction of the country?"
