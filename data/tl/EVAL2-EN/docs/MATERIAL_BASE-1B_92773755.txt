Bangayan on the Philippines.

Bangkal, Philippines (Lk. 21) it is scary that the calamity happened due to typhoon Yolanda.

The church was destroyed and the former progressive country was destroyed, many lives were gone, and there were no place where there was no place where they bought from other places where there were no places where their progressive economy was gone, and there were no places where their progressive economy was gone.

Also lost are the modern technology that they built.

Many lives were lost because many in an instant are orphaned.

Lost a child, lost his wife, lost their parents, lost his friends, that the former appearance of their lives will not be restored.

Even if the church was gone, but God did not lose the church, the people who continue to steal and gain weight on her.

It will be hard for the community to undergo again but the typhoon did not get up with the hope of the people to start again because Yolanda did not reach the strength of the people who are together.
And face what they're going through.
