Honor Code.

I do not understand why it seems like it is a very big issue that was made into the cadet of the Philippine Military Academy, Aldrin Jeff Cudia because it would have been regret because it will end up, especially since he will be held accountable, especially since he is going to be a lawyer who will be sentenced to "SEA Games" PMA Class 2014.
We understand this because they are very noisy after four years of suffering from the PMA because it will end up all over two minutes in his class because only because of this, the future they would like for two minutes and the family who depend on him will collapse.
However, it is just right for us to accept that the PMA has its own system and it has its own policies, since it has passed since it comes to the legislative chamber that they call as the honor code "is in the disputed policy that they should be living in the academy.
The words "Tanim-fi was said to be a joke, which is a law of the PMA due to the start of the PMA due to the start of every move by the PMA and this is expected to be known through social media like Facebook, which is expected to be a trend of every cadet until now that they will finally be totally complete.
According to the management of the PMA, Cudia broke the "honor code" when he was late to his class, if he was late to his class, if he was delayed, instead of sending a punishment because of violation of "honor code."
For us, ordinary citizens, this is just a small thing but for the cadet of the PMA like Cudia, this reflects his character not only as a soldier but as a leader.
When I took a responsibility, one of the traits that we are looking for in a leader and it seems that Cudia was negligent.
And if I will be asked, let us leave this issue because we do not have the place to involve himself in the policies of the PMA due to the people like many of us who do not know the meaning of their Honor Code.
