What is important?

It is not hard to know if what you are doing is important or not important, if you know what you stand and give importance.

This is our continuing doubt, if we will be facing trouble, no questions that are always trying to fit in our minds, what will I prioritize in this morning?

It is just repeating, he guarantees, and after a while, we don't have control of what is important and what's important is that we do not have control and what's important is that we do not have control, and what's important is that we do not have control, and what's important is that we do not have control, and what's important is that we have no one who can help, and what is not important to our friends, who will be happy?

Even if this is more intense, it can be acceptable if it is clear and sure that we will make it clear and you are sure that we will be able to decide if you will not be able to decide and you have no decision, this is a decision.

Believe in yourself and be impulsive with what your heart is beating for and you will never be with your heart.
