Like it was not an emergency.
Bailagutan, August 12, 2016.
We thought that the proposal to give emergency powers to President Rodrigo Duterte is supported to resolve the worsening problem of traffic.
But what is the plan of the Senate that they cannot rush the progress of the emergency power bill?
It is because Senator Grace Poe said, the Senate committee on the public Services Committee is said to have an effective proposal to make sure that this will be an effective action in solving the worsening traffic in Metro Manila, it is also necessary to respond to solve the worsening traffic in Metro Manila.
It is also important to know, according to the committee, where and how they will use the emergency powers, so that the crisis in traffic will be effective, which is the primary aim of giving power.
We caught the point of the Senate because of the bad event that happened during the time of the emergency powers by former President Fidel V. Ramos to the problem of the country, which resulted in the questionable provisions like "tanim-bala"
But the Senate must see the strict needs as soon as possible in the emergency powers because the situation now is too severe because the traffic flow is too severe because it does not choose any hour or day.
So for me, the Senate needs to give consideration to the issue today and not in the next months, the people need to solve the approval of the traffic so we should not make it anymore if we really want it to be done.
What would we do is a solution to traffic if it will not immediately be implemented.
The emergency powers will lose its meaning if the discussion will be slow or if it will be given to the president just like what the Senate is planning now.
Just like a waste, the good intention in giving emergency powers to solve the problem of traffic is a waste if this will not immediately be blessed.
