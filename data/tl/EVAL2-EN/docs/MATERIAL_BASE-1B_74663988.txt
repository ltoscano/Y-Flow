"You are like a horny."

Many of our fellow countrymen gave the Luneta yesterday to protest against President Aquino.
Here is the start of the Filipino people so that he would be removed?
Aside from what is brought to the pork barrel scam, PNoy is condemning this because of the worsening lack of work, poverty, poverty, difficulty in food and the price of basic products.
PNoy also criticized up to the slow response of his government for the rehabilitation of those affected by the previous typhoons, particularly the typhoon Yolanda.
Well, the pain in PNoy's headache is filled up.
It is not just the pork barrel that they want to take away but Aquino himself, which is also stated in Malaca√±ang.
Because the truth is, irritated and irritated of PNoy.
It's embarrassing to see what he is always saying, "my boss" said. "
Yesterday, the boss of PNoy himself asked to leave from the Palace in Malacanang, I mean, in his own dreams.
Well, why is it so?
This is the fault of PNoy.
The "way that he is going to right is twisted.
What he is saying is that the two are not able to make it alive.
He himself wants to abuse the power.
He said that he already wanted for a time for extension.
Are you extension, PNoy?
Please go to the beauty parlor and you can decide for extension of your hair!!
Do you not feel ashamed?
You can see the real situation of the Filipino.
We are already hungry.
Because it is very difficult because many of us have no job.
That is why many kill and make mistakes.
Your boss in squatters are getting sick, no money, no money for medication, cannot eat properly and enough.
You are the only ones of your allies and personnel who get rich.
Do you want to stay long there in his position.
It's too hot! It's in the corner of Ns.
