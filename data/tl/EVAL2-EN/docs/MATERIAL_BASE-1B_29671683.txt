There is no government in flood.

The sky is dark in Metro Manila and in some nearby areas the day before yesterday.
It seems that the residents of Central Luzon and Metro Manila experienced dark when the Mount Pinatubo exploded.
The two were almost the same time, at around 3: 4 in the afternoon.
After the dark part of the rain was affected by more than an hour, after this was the widespread flooding, and the flood was an analysis of the entire Metro Manila until 9: 10 in the evening.
Hundreds of thousands of people were stranded or without a ride, thousands of cars were destroyed, and the gasoline tank was damaged, it sank and was submerged in flood.
A lot of business has stopped and has exceeded the school, many workers were not able to go to work for many workers, even students.
In the province of Bulacan, four students of Bulacan State University drowned and two are still missing when the river suddenly grew up in the town of San Miguel.
But do you know, make the visible comment?
King-mother, the government does not find any force to help the citizens.
No Metro Manila Development Authority) is not the traffic enforcer because there is no police, no military.
And even if there are no politicians who did not do anything but orders the police and military to separate those who criticized them.
People who were fighting against different problems in rain and flood and death were left alone.
That is how our government is useless.
Among those who are noisy and moving are the contents of their interests.
There is their movement to protect the Constitution so that they remain in position until now.
There is a deep pork barrel that they can as well as the national budget that showed their corruption and corruption.
Just a question: Why are these not drowning in the flood to change our country?
