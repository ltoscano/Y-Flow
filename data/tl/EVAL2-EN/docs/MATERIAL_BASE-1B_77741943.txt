Fair law.
BE with Dacer-September 14, 2016, the city government of Caloocan is starting to start the strict implementation of laws on traffic including using helmet or helmet in a motorcycle.
According to him, the city government will not be able to take action on the implemented law that will be implemented by the government or the law enforcers, the law enforcers, traffic enforcers who will be arrested when violating.
They say that this kind of directive is not needed by this kind of directive from a local government unit because we will understand all the orders.
If we notice that it is not only in Caloocan City there is a problem which is not fair in the implementation of traffic, it can be clearly seen in the entire Metro Manila where the traffic enforcers, policemen, government that does not care, will not care even without a helmet.
It's as if only because they are implementing the law, they will be used to those who are guilty, especially in traffic laws.
That's why we will not be surprised why in spite of the strict implementation of "No.
They might reason why the traffic enforcers, police and other people from the government should not be made sure that they are like that.
The lesson in this issue should be an example of the law enforcers.
If you follow the law, the law should be implemented so that there will be no doubt that you will follow the people.
With this kind of style, it is sure that we will be easy to implement the law and respect the people.
