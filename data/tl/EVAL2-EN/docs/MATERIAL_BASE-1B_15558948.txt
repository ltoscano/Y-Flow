Budol-budol Gang.

The Budol-budol gang, 7-14), 7-14) earlier said that the Budol-budol gang was used to have been victimized by a priest and said that he wanted to give money to the church and told the crew to just wait for him inside the church and brought him to the coins.

He waited for a long time that he did not know that the man escaped carrying the money.

But what is irritating here is that the crooks used the name of the priest.

The crew members trusted that what he is talking to is the church that they are talking to, but when they think that it is the church that we're talking to, the people who want to get to each other so that we should learn how to get an honor, we should be proud of the stories of people who have gone to him.

There are people who are rich and can no longer respect the poor and who have a high fist, it seems that the real honor is not being asked, it seems that the real honor is given to the heart of other people.

Let us remember the story of a priest.

He brought her to a garage and put it to a mechanic, why the machine was very noisy, the machine was very noisy, "his real honor is with humility and not to be deceived by the Budol-budol gang!
