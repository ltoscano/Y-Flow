Drilon and foreigners.

The investigation conducted by the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee should be included in the anomaly involving Senate President Fransis Drilon about the love of the Iloilo Convention Center.
This is the right thing to prove the said committee, particularly Senator TG Guingona, Alan Cayetano, Antonio Trillanes and Coco Pimentel, to the public because if they carry out the plunder case of Drilon who are similar to the Makati Parking Bureau, it would be realistic and said that he has been touched by Vice President Jojo Binay.
The sincerity of the Senate is at stake, because they need to prove to the country that they are not in exchange of political or only solution to what they are doing to Binay.
In the complaint filed by Manuel Mejorada, Jr., former provincial administrator of Iloilo, in the Ombudsman, it was proven that Drilon was accomplices in the southwest monsoon which was implemented by PDAF and DAP.
It is clear in the complaint of former Iloilo official that the price increase of ICC was clear which he also hung DPWH Sec. Rogelio Singson and Tourism Sec. Ramon Jimenez.
This is where they should show that they are no one in exchange even if it is their allies and enemies that is why we are calling on the anti-year Lamasan) and COA to start the investigation and revelation of the anomaly by Drilon.
People will judge at the PNoy administration so the allies of Aquino should be true because people know what they are doing especially if they are making a sin.
