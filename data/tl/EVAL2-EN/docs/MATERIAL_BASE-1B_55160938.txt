We can do it: The Philippines, a friend of all.
According to October 21, 2016 - the latest survey of the Social Weather Stations or SWS) is the latest survey of the Social Weather Stations or SWS, where it shows that our countrymen are still small with the bullying of us by the country China in the West Philippine Sea, where up to now, China still does not want to fish the fishermen there.
It is also not surprising that we have a big trust in America because in the past few decades, they are able to give a big help to our country especially during the time of tragedy when typhoon Yolanda hit us in our countrymen during those times. "

It is surprising that the statement of President Rodrigo Duterte is clear that it is better for him to have a proper relationship with China than America.
The truth is, we do not need to buy who will be friends and our ally, our relationship can be better if our relationship will become better if our relationship will become good in two big countries.

For example, do you know that it is almost 80 percent of the call centers in our country now, the client is a big company in America, when Duterte and his administration can lose their jobs if this happens, their families will lose their jobs.
The country China is the strongest country in Asia that is why Duterte is right for his way of courting so that our country can get help.

In my news, Duterte already received a promise from China who will help in the construction of the train that will participate in northern Luzon until this, the news will also help in the construction of drug rehabilitation centers to our country.
We can see that the Philippines does not need to buy his allies and friends, everyone can be our friend so that more people helped our country more.
