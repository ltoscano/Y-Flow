The Marcos dictatorship.

The regime of President Benigno Aquino III is almost over but until now, he has a big belief that his administration is successful in all field of service civilians.
On the All Soul's Day, May 1, he hid in Laguna economic zone to face a few of the workers who were dressed up with TESDA (those who attended.
He said, every year, he has already given a job for more than two thousand, he was able to give a job for more than two thousand who were caught by his agency, only four years, "that's the only one that you gave, the Filipinos are more than 100 million!
Is it a puppy to DOLE chief Rosalinda Baledz and his personnel, because our laborers are lacking in the right skills that's why they don't go to work, do you know the stupidity that you are saying?
Every day, more or less workers just go to our country just to work for jobs.
It appears that since the Marcos regime was seated, his system was worse in the Marcos dictatorship before, even if the citizens can see any concrete projects, there will be no corruption in infrastructure that up to now they are being utilized by the people.
Now, the declaration of martial law and the dictatorship under Aquino has destroyed its system which is afraid to decide based on the appropriate law in fear that he will be impeached, but also by the pork barrel scam of Janet Lim-Napoles but also by his allies in Pili, President and his friends are destroying.
The executive leader was destroyed by that and he did not hide anything that was destroyed by the Career Executive Service (CEheart) for the government agencies that he reached for the allegations of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.
The replaced is all lacking, but no one knows that it is really no matter.
There is no fear for him / her as the leadership of the dictatorship, he will be able to finish his relationship with the kind of beauty of the country because of his threats to be ashamed of them.
