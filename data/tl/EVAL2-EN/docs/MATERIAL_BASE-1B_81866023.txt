The first week after Christmas is the beauty of the Holy Family, this is the day when a family is living together with the countries with christians.
This is the performance of our faith and greeting to the family of Jesus.
Our conversation this Christmas is one proof of our respect to our fellowmen, especially to our parents who are concerned about what happened to God, and the true celebration of our mother who is safe from what happened to Jose: "You will see the real life of the angel to Jose:" You will see the mother and child. "
This is aside from our Filipinos, that in spite of poverty, we want to be united every Christmas, for the Filipinos, to pray for all the families of Jesus, Maria and Jose to give peace and pray for us to be together.
