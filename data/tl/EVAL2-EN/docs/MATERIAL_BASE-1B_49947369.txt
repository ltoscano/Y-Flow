Purisima, guilty.

Hi's briefs on Roy "Mamondiong," Seiko Films.

The Ombudsman is already fired by General Alan Purisima and 10 more officials of the PNP because of his involvement to 100 million questionable transactions.
In a 50-page decision, Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales said, they proved that Purisima and the policemen are going to be liable in the formal conduct, serious attacks and abuse of PAGCOR.
It has been long proposed by many officials of the government, including Senator Bongbong Marcos, that Purisima should be removed from his position.
But President Noynoy did not pay attention to him and he even told Bongbong and the other officials who want to remove Purisima from service, "take a hidden talent."
It's a good thing that the Ombudsman is a real child and they did not pay attention, which is the opposite of the Executive branch, so when they will prove the mistake of Purisima, they immediately decided to oust him from the PNP.
The action of the Ombudsman is a direct slap to President Aquino because he does not want to be tainted by a fly "by his favorite general.

I'm greeting by Ombudsman Morales because he implemented the second day suspension order to Makati City Mayor Junjun Binay, who is facing different cases of the graft case.
Aside from being dismissed from service, the 1,000 pesos in benefits of Purisima will also be gone.
Purisima has not yet finished the head of Purisima in the Ombudsman because he is still facing two cases of plunder, the case that was held in San Leonardo, Nueva Ecija and the White House deal inside Camp Crame.
Aside from this, Purisima wants to hold a lot of officials in the Mamasapano massacre which killed the 44 PNP SAF.
