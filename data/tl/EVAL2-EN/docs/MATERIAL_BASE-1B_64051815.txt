Senate, will not offer the emergency power By Boyet Jihadist, August 11, 2016 "do not be afraid of the emergency power."
This is the call of Transportation Secretary Arturo Tugade in the Senate after the senators expressed their fear on the said proposition to resolve President Rodrigo Duterte of the emergency power to resolve the problem of traffic in Metro Manila and other parts of the country.
The statement of Tugade is that it is as if Senator Grace Poe was not the one to promise after Senator Grace Poe, wheelchair of the Senate Committee on public service, should examine it well to ensure that this will be an effective treatment in solving the worsening traffic in Metro Manila.

"What is needed is the jurisdiction of the limitation of emergency powers.

"To where and how will this be used to meet the crisis in traffic," Poe said.
"There should be no idea for the next generation that will be held accountable and in the next generation that, we will make sure that they will ensure the resolution of the contract because we should know the details and regulations," Poe insisted.
According to Poe, his committee will conduct a "athers" or one or two hearing every week and hopefully, it will be a basis for the plenary in the Senate.
Poe also said that he cannot rush the progress of the emergency power bill because they are able to offer the welfare of the people if they will immediately approve it.
