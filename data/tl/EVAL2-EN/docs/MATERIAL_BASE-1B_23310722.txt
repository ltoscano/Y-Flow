Really hungry.
Not worried about the hunger and hardship being experienced by those whose legs are experiencing.
If they have a plan to allocate funds for the victims of calamities, it seems that it would be for the next year.
Just like what they show to the suspension of the national budget for the next year.
They do not feel the daily pain in the stomach and too much lack of distress.
