The gony of Love.

The Irony of Love, a scene in the Philippines' Caretero, My Heart... that her husband raised him for a long time due to the invitation of Ser Chief, she also wanted her father to see what happened, as long as she did not want to see what happened, as to why she was able to leave their father for a long time.

And their father once again appeared at the anger of Aling Teresita when she confronted his wife to avoid being beaten-in his / her partner, which was seen to be hidden by his / her superman.

Replaced with others.

That he is not worthy of his love for him and hopefully she is still waiting for her own mother, he is still waiting for his self, but until now, he is still waiting for his self, but until now, he is still waiting for his self, but until now, he is still waiting for his self-being.
