Tragedy.

Tragedy will come out in the middle of the tragedy, evil and goodness of a person.

Typhoon Yolanda is raised in many provinces of Bishops again.

Many houses and strategies were destroyed and many lives were destroyed in one moment, and until now, many are still missing.

They need help but because of what happened, the evil of other people will come out and they can find a morale.

Many people get things that are not for them because they need to make things that they need to make things that they cannot do for their own welfare, but in the middle of this, there is a good opportunity for the people to get up.
Even if it came from other countries, they are able to help even if the Holy Pope asked to give assistance to the media that they are making a way to bring help to our fellowmen, but many have lost their loved ones, but their faith in the Lord is not gone.

There are stories that they are not able to save anything but what they are carrying is the image of our Lord, because of different opinions, in the end, everyone will be united and one will help each other in the middle of the tragedy that there will be more blessings!

May we be blessed by our Lord?
