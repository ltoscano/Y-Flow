The PNP wants with the issue of the drug ring.

The Philippine National Police (PNP) is very hard when the administration knows that they want to identify the people who owns an unlicensed guns inside the National Bilibid Prison (NBP).
This is related to the past attack of the authorities inside the NBP, where a unique life was exposed on each of the prisoners who were called Very Tumescence which can be called Very Binuhe.
Revealed to us are the deep wrongdoings in Bilibid, but not only the neighboring provinces but more than the blind officials of NBP.
It is not going to happen that these are not going to happen but if the NBP officials did not permission, they were covered with controversy since PNoy sat down, right?
Or, now, the PNP was immediately riding on this issue after he went the person who gave a gun inside the NBP like the gun of drug convict, Peter Co.
They are brave, they are still wondering how the legitimate or registered guns were found inside Bilibid, but their employer, Alan who had a lot of properties.
It's embarrassing, but this point of the PNP is still suspended because the company and company of boss Alan and PNP might have brought a gun to Peter Co inside Bilibid. Tetsk.
Or, isn't it right?
In my opinion, this is like someone who will borrow money from the PNP, it is impossible that nobody will borrow money from the NBP) and if someone will borrow money in the NBP, it is certain that there is also one of the Department of Justice (DOJ) of Aling Leila.
Pad Street, PNP officials, they think of the mirror "as time passes" what is called "K," I think there is nothing in the PNP to give a statement as if their agency is clean.
He / she was wearing.
