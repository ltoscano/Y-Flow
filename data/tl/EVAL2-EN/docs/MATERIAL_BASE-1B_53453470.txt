Witnesses: Not easy to do.
By Jimmy Cantos, on September 3, 2016.
Party-list Congressman Mike Romero is one of those who attended the meeting done by the Philippine Sports Commission on the past few days of CEuphrasia Eve Park Hotel to have a masters plan in sports and the agency.
Romero wants to have a bad plan to have a bad plan, which is why the training of our bet), Recruitment and their athletes are going to be athletes, and they are going to get corrupt and ready to become an coach.
Romero is convinced that it will be a good place for a National training center to Clark International Airport from Angeles, Pampanga because it is far from the appointed action and pollution in Metro Manila, it is not new to the anomalous action and pollution in Metro Manila.
Of course, the hardest for this is the construction of the national training center at Clark, the money that will be used here, and the money that will be used for the training of the athletes.
According to the law, PAGCOR needs to be given five percent by the PSC from the National Sports Fund) but this is not followed.
When the administration of President Fidel V. Ramos came in 1992, the support received by the PSC from PAGCOR was broken when it was almost 2.3 per cent, according to the sanctity of the PSC.
The PSC is still receiving a lot, if you think about it, but this is not enough to strengthen the sports program of the country.
This is also one of what Romero said, that PAGCOR needs to bring back the five percent of the amount that he needs to give to the PSC.
Even Senator Manny Pacquiao is also the call of President Duterte for no answer from Malaca√±ang.

The PSC will surely lose a good boss because he has received a lot in different sectors but it will not be easy to implementation it.
Do you need an iron fist for this?
