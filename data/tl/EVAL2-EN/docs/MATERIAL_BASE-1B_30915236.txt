A rat in the chest.

If you can call on stage and let it be seen in front of many, do you feel fear and an analysis of what will happen to you?, if you are nervous, you are nervous, you will surely get to get away from your chest and want to get away.

You are sweating at the cold and losing to know if you are not ready to talk or look at it, as long as you are not ready to talk and listen to others, you still need to talk and listen to others, and the poor continue to cry and listen to others.

Why are violence, corruption, corruption and abuse of human rights in our society?

Things that are asking for answers and justice.

So because we do not have knowledge or care on why our suffering continue.

Because because there is just a small roof, we are trying to drive and look like a fish and dried fish, we are happy.

Because, because there are countries that have long been a hobby on television and newspapers!

Because the joke is much better, especially if there are gay people who are laughing at, because the money that they are holding from the selling of the candidate is more beautiful than the integrity of the candidate.

Because there is no justice and those who are the only ones who are true and followed.

Because no matter how hard it is to do, if you are a beggar, all of you are thinking of lack of poverty.

So because we are used to sleep, sleeping, and trying to sleep on the events in our surroundings.

Because because this happens to parents, you are sure that this will happen to us.

Because it is good for you to wait to be selfish than to protest about the challenge, so that you will not be harmed.

... that, because we have accepted the lack of hope, that no one can help our hearts, and whatever fate comes to us, may it be!
