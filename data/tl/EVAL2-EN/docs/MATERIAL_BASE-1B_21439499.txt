Tyo, and a stand.

Fate will be favored.

Mind, body, and the pirates.

Study it up and I noticed that the leadership is not your ability to have the character or kind of character.

The successful, happy, and peaceful people who involved people who take care of the integrity, loyalty, and bravery of the real leaders who are taking advantage of their personal ambition, as well as the same kind of followers and good leader.

When things are lost, or they fail, they will recover and discover the right solution in their depths to make sure that what he wants in life is starting and how to make a stand on what he wants in life, and how to make sure that she will be able to pay for all his fares.

If you focus on your whole attention in each moment, you will directly wake up to the events; this is a good experience, and peaceful life, and in a peaceful life, your fate is in your hands.

The resolve of real Filipinos.

You will follow 1-June.

2 - there is a need to persevere more than expected and be calm than others.

3 - the leadership is a donation, not a right and even power.

4-known Filipinos, I will be able to catch up again, but to take care of and defend my family and my country.

5-M will be able to finish the happiness in expressing their goodness, making goodness, great love, and not to chase after the small entertainment, wealth, position, and becoming fame.

A 6-April will be able to improve myself, in order to fix my traits and skill, my family, my group, and community in each day.

7- I am deeply hoping that many of our countrymen are thinking deeply and meaningful about this, and this only is being prepared to achieve their dreams.

If you will not stand on anything, you will easily get thin even if there is no meaning.
