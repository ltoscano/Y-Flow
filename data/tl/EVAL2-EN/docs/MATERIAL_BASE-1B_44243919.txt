The media killings in the Philippines.

Last month, the National Press Club was surprised at the murder of Richard Najib, Chinese caster of Dumpsite, radio in Tawi-Tawi.
Yesterday, the NPC was just surprised by shooting and murder of Nilo Bacon, Junior of Fire Station Anti-M in Calapan City.
But despite the consecutive killings of the media, the Aquino administration is just quiet and observing.
In history, during the time of President Noynoy Aquino the most killed journalists.
Not lying is the number of reports, Bacon the 129 journalists who were killed during the time of PNoy.
Like this, the PNoy administration has become a record of history if the media killing will be talked about in the Philippines.
Why is the right killing of the media personnel?
We think, the government is not true in his statement which is said to be stopped in order to stop the media.
Because if they are true, "hopefully the NPC is disrupted for the consecutive killings of the members of the fourth Estate.
Let us not talk about those who have been killed are those who are killed and are also important in mind that the government is missing.
With the number of killed journalists, this is a proof that the Aquino administration is useless in response to the media killings.
If only the resolve of the PNoy government is hard, the killer of the said crime will surely be caught.
And when the Aquino administration is pursued by the Aquino administration to catch the criminals, surely no one will be have the guts to kill journalists.
That is why thieves are brave because they see that the government does not care about the crime they are doing.
Every time there are being killed journalists, "the Palace will not allow them to defeat the PNP in order to chase the criminals.
They are only good there.
But it is only up to public service because it is very rare for those who killed the 29 journalists since Noynoy became president in 2010.
