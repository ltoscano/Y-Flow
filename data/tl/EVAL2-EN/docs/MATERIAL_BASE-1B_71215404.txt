Transparency in the leadership.
July 26, 2016, we will not fully achieve the desires under the signed Executive Order (DND) of President Rodrigo Duterte because it is a good start to ruin the transactions in the government which is the primary mission in pushing the FOI.
In the said EO is all the offices of the government under the executive leader, he may give information, official records and other public funds for any Filipino who wants to get a lot.
Because of this, let us expect the development of Congress to give the FOI to be colonized by everyone including all the level of a bureaucracy. However, we are included in all the level of a bureaucracy. However, we salute the very kind of waste time by President Duterte in the FOI.
It is very important that President Duterte signed the implementation of the FOI because it shows his acceptance of the rights on the information that is the first step for the transparent leadership that he is really the goal of the Duterte government.
What's important at this point is President Duterte made a real initiative to have a event in having the FOI and hopefully this will be an inspiration in Congress to give time and attention on the implementation of the FOI, which has been set aside for the personal interest of some officials of the government.
