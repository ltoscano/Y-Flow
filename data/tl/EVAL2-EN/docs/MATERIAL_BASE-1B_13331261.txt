Bulang Malinao, August 27, 2016.
There was a new traffic czar, Metro Manila, in the character of Philippine National Police Highway Patrol Group (Chief Superintendent Antonio Garay.
Garbo was appointed by the Department of Transportation (DOTr) Secretary Arthur Tugade, chief of the Inter-Agency) of Traffic (I-ACT).
The "ACT party consists of PNP-HPG, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), Land Transportation Office (LTO) and Land Transportation Office (LTO) and Land Transportation Office (LTO), will have a new project to solve the severe traffic problem especially in the stretch of EDSA.
Even though it is really new, the official gave hope to the motorists and passengers that may lessen the amount of time in the coming months because all that can be done to free up the flow of traffic will be implemented.
Garabat will be tasted by a few implemented solution and part of this is the short-time-time-time, which is considered by the political group, who are giving thanks to the traffic enforcers.
There will also be an training of the personnel or those who oppose the flow of traffic to ask for the right way of taking care of gnomes.
The official will also talk with ACT-scans of local government units (LGUs) to resolve the local ordinances that should add to the national laws that add up to the constricted streets.
Let us grant the official in his good goal in fixing the flow of traffic in Metro Manila and hopefully, Director Garay is now the answer of the intense competition brought to all traffic in Metro Manila.
So to Director Garay, we wish for your success.
