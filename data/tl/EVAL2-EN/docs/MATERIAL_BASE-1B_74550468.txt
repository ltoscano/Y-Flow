Let it go because it is illegal and illegal gambling in Laguna.

We are in favor, the RP), in the Armed Forces Battalion but not in the entire stated in the Agreement!
"That is what we stand for even before, the relationship with America or any neighbor is important.
Acting, it is natural for our friends to be visited by our friends because we believe, no person or a country can live in himself!
"Isn't it that we have proven that, since the support of the whole world poured out with the problem brought about by" Yolanda? "
"That's the only thing that the government is carrying the said aid!
Pest!
Let's go back to it, make it look like a delinquent "agreement" which will ruin the Visiting Forces here in our country.
Why did we not allowed to tell the VFA, the provision that is indication that if the Filipino soldier did something to do or make a crime here in our country, it needs to be in the custody of America or their embassy?
King-mother, we are losing because of it, deloy, because their soldiers are the only ones who go here!
In short, they are the only ones who have the chance to taste the grapes, rape, kill and haunt our countrymen!
In fact, this is not the case of US Marines Joseph Scott Pemberton about the first abuse of us since the international VFA is implemented.
Isn't it that he was raped before by the American soldier, Daniel Smith, our fellowmen who is Nicole?
What I want to say, make sure, the meddling is a good thing if it is beneficial for the status of a honest relationship.
But if visiting there is only the result of rape, killing or abuse of those they are visiting, well, it should be allowed to evict them as a song, which seems to be taken away!
What should be done here, to our senators, instead of all politicking, they should review the VFA.
And if they do not want to evict the Americans, then let us go to them the missing policemen! Ehek!
