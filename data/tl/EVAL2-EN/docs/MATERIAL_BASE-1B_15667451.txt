What is about?

There is a proposal to prolong the administration of President Noynoy in 2016.
The proposal came from the internet but to be delivered to his name is usually a alias "
It seems that the President did not agree with this proposal, but the netizens were insistent.
They want Noynoy to remain in the country even if it is prohibited in the Constitution.
What is dangerous is that Noynoy would like this proposal to file the Constitutional Commission or Constitutional Commission, who will participate in congress are the allies of Noynoy in the Congress who benefited from the pork barrel scam.
The call of pro-Noynoy netizens is too bad.
If what they want to happen will be true, the will be sure that the will be put end up until it ended up in a box that is happening which is why the corrupt officials that we are against are corrupt officials.
Earlier this is the suggestion of Speaker Sonny Belmonte to have a charter change in order to change the 1987 Constitution, President Cory and his allies with the outline.
In the previous SONA or the State of the Nation Address of Noynoy, he expressed that there are people who want him to remove from his position and remove him in tears.
The new chief of Staff of the President dispelled that the military has no plans to take care.
But Senator Sonny Trillanes who says the pro-Aquino said that there is an attempt to be an attempt to undergo an ID, and the retired generals who are pro-Arroyo.
This was denied by the retired members, this was also denied by the camp of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.
He was really for Tempo, extension.
This was also given to President Cory Aquino that he has been deceived by President Cory Aquino.
Looks like Fidel Ramos also liked this proposal but the pro-charter change won't win.
Gloria also liked this but he did not became a popular Police Officer EP / Raul Valino.
