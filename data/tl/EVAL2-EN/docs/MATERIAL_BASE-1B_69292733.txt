My New Year's bra.

We have made it a habit - when the year is changing, the question is famous and saying: The New Year's Day?
An ordinary answer is to ask what is the New Year's organization or EDCA - to change the wrong attitude and task.
Yes, even if we are New Year with PSC, but the question is this, how can we do it?
It is possible that some are fulfilling the New Year's Martial Law but most of them have said now but always remember after.
"That is the attitude that should not change if Mister Juan and Aling Maria wants to change their lives.
If New Year's Day is to change your much laziness, you should be responsible for your hard work.
I am sorry but this is the truth - laziness is just a few of the bad attitude - let us admit - we are not progressing.
In other countries, especially in progressive countries, like Japan, Canada and Australia - no "Juan lazy."
If there are New Year with New Year.
Distribution of Japanese, Canadian and Australian - this is only helping those who are in mind and are in mind.
Because it is because, they have money, this is a result of their industrious, that is why their lives get stronger.
What is the difference between Filipinos?
If we want to progress, let us do the model in our lives.
We need to make a right and need to.
"We are not saying that Juan and Maria dela Cruz is lazy, many of our Filipinos are hardworking and hardworking.
But we cannot deny it - there are more "Juan lazy," we do not like Haramoto, Baldwin and Jones.
Let us not be dependent on it, "the New Year, new hope, which we usually hear.
This is a need to move forward in order to achieve the hope that we are looking for when the New Year arrives.
We are like a cellphone load, gay, because this is what I usually see every New Year, but I am sorry for my persistence to change the attitude of many Juan and Maria.
Happy New Year!
