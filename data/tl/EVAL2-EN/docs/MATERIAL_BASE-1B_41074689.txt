LP, who prevailed in the committee instead of President Rodrigo Duterte.
This is after the members of the Liberal Party (LP) must prevail in some position compared to the allies of the PDP-Laban, similar to the Nacionalista Party (WHO), which is headed by Senator Cynthia Villar, who is former senator Manny Villar.
Villar confirmed yesterday that the Senate President Aquilino "Koko" Pimentel III favored Senator.

Francis "Kiko" Pangilinan stated that the Office of Agriculture Committee was held at the 16th Congress and he still wanted to hold a hold of the 17th Congress and they still want to hold the Agriculture Committee because of his advocacy to help the farmers with additional income.
But despite his desire to lead the said committee, Pimentel gave it to Pangilinan who is a member of the LP.
Because the committee of Agriculture is not able to accept, it is said that Villar is still ready to receive other committee who are not far from agriculture.
"To me, what will I do and they asked me if I have an alternative, I was impressed by Talk n Fight IT... that I will see what kind of Agriculture Sec.
Based on Fight IT for a cent, I know that the problem of those who are going to be the problem of the Pambansang Kamao will not be seen by the "traslacion" by my opinion, "that's why I am the one of the Lapian ng mga Bayani or thank you," stated by Villar in an interview yesterday.
He said that he might not be the antagonist to the current administration because his son, Las Pi√±as Representative Mark Villar, will become a member of the cabinet because he will be the secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) when it comes to the month of August.
