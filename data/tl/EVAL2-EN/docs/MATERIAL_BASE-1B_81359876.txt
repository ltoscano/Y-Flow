Chase and confused.

Almost all agencies of the government are in a hurry to make a project.
The Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) was leading the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA).
According to Malaca√±ang, according to me, their boss allegedly ordered, who else is President Benigno Aquino III, because President Benigno Aquino III did not do anything because he is worried that his term is almost done, that's why he is worried that it has been an inheritance of the country.
In the cabinet meetings, Noynoy got mad at his personnel.
Therefore, we are ready for it to be prepared for almost a dozen, but the question is, they will be able to finish each other at the same time, that's why they will be able to finish each other in a very long time?
We know that our contractor is going to go to the country is just pretending, and bareta were only used in the digging that's why they seem to be given a big help to include the real job and workers in the government, it is true, isn't it?
Just like the news coming out about the DOTC Sandugo Awarding Ceremony held by some of the new MRT and LRT, which is known to have been good to do the railway and wagons, which is known to have been good to commit the railway and wagons, "they even asked the presidential brother-in-law," Elrick Cruz and Presidential-law, Ballsy Aquino Cruz!
There is also the LTO, under the DOTC, who are in a hurry to release a plate number of vehicles that almost two years have not given a franchise by the public utility vehicles that almost two years, when there is an accident, LTFRB and one of them are the lack of franchise!
It's okay to rush you but hopefully they should not risk the quality of all their projects.
It appears that there is a chase for your system, instead of blessing, it will result to accident!
