Ask!

The quality of character is not an accident since it is always the result of a smart interrogation who you really are.

How can I meet myself?

If there is knowledge, it will start a peaceful life instead of having a deep life, instead, it is the way to make noise in a place and will not be busy with a deep sigh of a deep sigh of a deep breath, let it be known to know these questions: What will I do if ever?

- I found out that I only have one year to live?

- there was a disastrous storm like "typhoon Yolanda" in our area?

- one of my friends came and asked to help him go home, but I was ready to watch a movie on this day?

When I found out that our mayor was hiding in his private warehouse, the donated food, clothes and blanket for those who suffered from the fire, and selling?

When I won the lotto of a million peso?

- there is one opportunity and the secret project that I can make it pass and I will earn big money without any one to know?

- if I have a companion at work, he's slandering me when he is behind our cherness?

Study well it is very important and you need to understand thoroughly.

These are just a few questions that you need to answer to know your real personality, or the bitter attitude.

Whatever your answers are, this is your existing character.

For example, if your friend is asking you to help him go home and your answer is, you will learn to be able to change and correct, you can learn how to be blamed by the real Filipinos you want to change and correct.

Because this depends on what kind of relationship will bring you to others, and will become a kind of fate waiting for you.

In order to achieve knowledge, you need to study; but in order to achieve what you want, you need to observe it.
