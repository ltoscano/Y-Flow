Changes were promised by President Rodrigo Duterte on his seat in Malaca√±ang and the most important is the fight against illegal drugs and criminality as well as the cleaning of the ranks of the police.
As held by Ambo TIDs of the chief of police and cities in Metro Manila, and even in nearby provinces, what will be promised by President Duterte to identify the chief of police in your area to know what they promised in the interview of Chief Inspector Mark Joseph Cajiyang, officer in charge of Rosario Police Station in Cavite.
"Since my post last July 1, I personally talked to the barangays of Oplan Tokhang, which is why we can make sure that we can explain well with the treacherous C (Barangay Anti-Illegal Drug Group) and because there are 800 hundred barangays who are placed in order and promised to have a stable life.
"We are also irritated with the top 10 Drug personalities here in Rosario, seven in there, and not there, the program has been given to the community service, and those who surrendered to their ability, that are the drivers, who want to drive as well as the city government.
I will also give an opportunity to those who are not yet assigned to August 11, because if they will not surface, we will conduct a huge drug operation against them and it will continue to conduct a huge drug operation against them and it will continue to be done until the first 3-6 months just like what our beloved President Rodrigo Duterte said.
