People get sick.
By Bernard Taguba, October 16, 2016.
It seems like this is not a good sign in the shown by the Department of Transportation (DOTr) that seems to be saying that the traffic problem will not be resolved if the emergency power cannot be given.
What if it can't be given the emergency power, I will not respond to this problem who protects in Metro Manila?
There are many ways to resolve this problem, political will only be the political will only change in implementing traffic rules, not only national, but it is not being implemented, but it is not being implemented on why I do not understand.
Hopefully while the DOTr is waiting in the emergency power, make steps that will help to resolve this problem because the people are getting sick because of the long time that he is being spent on the middle of traffic.
Not only the motorists get sick because of the risk of urinating, but also the passengers of public vehicles.
It would be good if the passenger buses like the provincial buses should have their own CR, but no one can do anything but endure and control the urine.
Maybe aside from a rock, there are also a lot of UTI or boasts in the motorists due to the cruelty of traffic.
The traffic is also increased so I asked Mr. Google what kind of diseases caused by stress in people.
Google: Some of the effects of stress is hurting the head, loss of chest, stomach pain, loss of sex, difficulty in sleep and to catch the stomach.
Even the ability of the person can also be affected by the often experience of stress, so don't be wondering why most of the commuters and motorists feel like being restless, lack of control of anger and depression.
That is why most of the drivers or drivers are hot-headed on the streets because of the stress they are experiencing.
It's not just that, there are a lot of hours that the traffic being taken from the children because their parents did not go home early because more than P3 billion pesos is missing in the economy.
