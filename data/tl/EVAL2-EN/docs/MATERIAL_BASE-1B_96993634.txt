Mayor Orca is to approach, YOUR.

There are many projects in the city of Caloocan since Mayor Oscar "Orca" announced in spite of talking about the store that the city is lacking in funds.
But instead of course, all projects will be thought first before it will be implemented like the cement in the road, building of a new building of school, etups, etse, or iced tea.
There was a complaint of us that there was someone placed inside a noodle house near the road there, which was used to pass through Susano Road in Viceral Compound of Zhh Road.
It cannot be determined who was the project, because there was no name on whose project, which is why the orange is also not a color, that is why it seems that the project is not for mayor.
I think he jokes about mayor like other motorists, that is why it is certain that this road is a big help to avoid the congested traffic flow especially in Susano Road in Quezon City.
It seems that the person behind putting up the city is already out of source of income because this is one of the called "City Road" but the One ps are busy with the motorists.
That means, that road will not be private, which is inside the funeral parlor Subdivision.
It means, the law is allowed to spend money on the road because it is owned by the city.
It means, that can pass through a public road and many use an alternative road going to and going out of the city.
It would be better if it would be better for the motorists and students to be able to help motorists, in front of the Caloocan City Business High School in Uruguay Village, what was done instead of spending.
I am doubting the said project was declared mayor, but because of course, "City Road," said the road, that is why Mayor Orca has the power of stopping to stop smoking.
That is not an exclusive area or a subdivision that is why there is no one beside it, PR... there is no ambulance!
