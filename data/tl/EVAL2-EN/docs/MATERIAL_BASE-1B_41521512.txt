The opposition is silent in the Senate.

It seems that the members of the mines of the Senate were stunned.
Because no matter how bad they are from the majority like Senator Alan Cayetano and Antonio Trillanes, the exchange of Opposition, like Senator Tito Sotto, Gringo Honasan and JV Ejercito, will ask for peace.
In the history of politics in the country, the opposition is always noisy but in continuing the events at present, this is different because the allies of PNoy, who are also full of corruption in the body, are also full of corruption in the body that's why he is also full of corruption in his body.
Now in my mind, how much is the opposition of the opposition in the country just like Sotto, who seemed to be silent and deaf to the events happening in the Senate and even in pushing politics in the state.
Sotto also chose to host and take care of the opposition if he is one of the expected ranks of the said group because he is one of the veteran lawmakers and a veteran lawmaker in politics.
Is it fear that the members of the establishments are afraid because the current leadership of their opponents Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, Jinggoy Estrada, Bong Revilla and Vice President Jojo Binay?
It's because everyone knows how the Aquino administration is proud of revenge and taking advantage of the people who are against them and this is the largest Factor, why it seems like it seems like a flood has been conquered by our airports.
In a short word, we are afraid that they will not be fooled because it is also not unknown to everyone that the veteran senators, Sotto and Honasan, is an expert of the DAP, and Security P that can file the attack against the Liberal Party and Malacanang.
This is what became the trend of politics in the country because if it was the victim's father, Ninoy's harassment of the Marcoses, especially when the opposition is given peace because of the threat of imprisonment and so many cases, everyone knows that there is a trace of politics.
