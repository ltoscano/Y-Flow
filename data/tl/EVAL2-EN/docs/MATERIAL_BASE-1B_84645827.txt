Watch out of P2.6T budget in 2015.

Hopefully it is true that there is no Priority Development Assistance Fund and Disbursement Acceleration Program in the next year.
The two damn is a sample of, the profit from the public funds of the congressmen, senators and from the palace.
"Did the Supreme Court declared that PDAF was against the Constitution last November 2014?
Of course, but do you know that the Supreme Court is only able to patrol the Supreme Court's first congressmen, senators and from the Palace?
They are the same with saying that what is really against PDAF is the meddling of the congressmen in the implementation of the projects or programs in the name of PDAF because what should be done is Malacañang who made the law enforcers.
That's why, it is not surprising why even if it is said that there is no PDAF, the congressmen and senators who teach on or offer the projects which have a relation to the country will have a proposition.
Which is why, he continues to worry about what he arrives.
Though they are not choosing their contractor who is allegedly being taken by the projects, no one can stop the lawmakers who take care of their contractor for their patrons.
And who has a saying without the crispiness in the field, duh!
This is the DAP, that's why he was declared dead.
This means that it is a part in the Constitution or DAP himself, especially if it's good to think about what PNoy only has done when PNoy is declared.
That's why, we can say that they can continue the DAP, and think there is still no final decision from the SC because Malacañang has an appeal to the decision.
If the senators and congressmen have known for P24-billion pesos and there is an estimation of more than P75,000 pesos DAP, Malacañang who are all sent to the hands of the king and their mother, whoa, they are being played around P100 million every year.
That's why we need to monitor PDAF and DAP.
