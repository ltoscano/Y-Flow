There is no useless law against smoking.

It has been a lot of laws passed by Congress every year but I noticed that it has nothing to do with the new tax and the only purpose is to put our society a very lazy to implement this.
It is said that the lot of money that come out of money and a piled up of money is being spent by our lawmakers to make them know the billions of funds for our lawmakers who are diligent in making laws that are not fully implemented.
An example here is Republic Act Number 9211 or "Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003" which prohibits smoking in our public places.
Almost every day we can see the drivers or abuse that is why the passengers of passenger jeepneys and bus who are smoking inside the said vehicle.
As narrated by one of our friends that when he confronted a passenger who is smoking, he was even caught and asked if he was a police.
The violation of law against smoking in public places is exposed since there is a traffic enforcer because the law enforcers does not know that the law does not know that there is a law?
Smoking is widespread inside the restaurant and the bar especially in Makati and Pasay City and this is known by our police, in fact, there are still-standing policemen in HK Plaza in Pasay City where they do not care.
The bar in Roxas Boulevard that is also full of smoke from the bar in Roxas Boulevard, like Bacon or Mansion), is also full of smoke that is where the lower show and sale of the contents of their provinces is already full of smoke.
It looks like the new chief of Pasay City Police Senior Superintendent Renz Orilla wants to be a famous and lazy.
Well, if a simple law is done, it cannot be implemented, how much can the heavier laws be implemented?
Does this know this by NCRPO director Chief Supt. Leonardo Espina or maybe the reason why he is just going to sneak?
He / she was wearing.
