Former Vice President Noli De Castro and ex-President had a misunderstanding with suspects plunderer Joseph "Erap" Estrada about the issue of vendors who were seated in the vicinity of Quiapo Church.
It's because the air-air that Noli de Castro has proposed, to sweep the vendors around the church this past Travers, especially those who are taking advantage of distress.
It looks like the distress of Erap and it seems that the vendors are pitiful.
"Hey, Mayor's heart is soft for the vendors, which is why those in Divisoria have grown tired of losing its cage and contract, and those who are in the vicinity of Abureaucracy.
That's why there, instead of additional income from the vendors, the money they collected money from the rent of the cage he is selling is bigger.
The vendors say that we were able to talk to it only now in the time of Erap who experienced too much difficulty in their livelihood because of the many who let go.
Erap's love for the vendors is really different.
It is like a Friends to be able to buy in benefits, right?
What do you think, Vice Mayor Isko Moreno?
