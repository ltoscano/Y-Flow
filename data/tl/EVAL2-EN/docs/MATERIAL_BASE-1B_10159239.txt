A crocodile in the airport continues.

Let us go to Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in terminal 1 and let us peek at those who have no heart of those from the Bureau of Immigration (BI), especially the two "crocodile" of Immigration, Cuba and Nigeria.
You see, almost 300 people who want to go out in other countries are confirmed to go to other countries in the airport, which is why they're trying to find out what are the documents.
If they say that if they do not have any document, these crooks are looking for them to steal or fight them and they are not able to leave.
Well, he did not feel pity for those who are from Immigration, this is no longer pity for people who are almost having a hard time in buying a ticket.
After that, the people in the airport are going to stop this, wherein their reason is that they might be working in other countries, particularly the women whose only wish is to be able to go to other countries especially in Asia.
Well, how about those who are trying to stop the sweet words that will give way?
