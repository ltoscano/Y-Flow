Let's just be guarded! PO 1 versus the PSC.
By Alunan, October 2, 2016 when the misunderstanding of the Philippine Football Committee (Commission C) and the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) exploded which is related to control of the National Capital Region which is preparing for the international competitions.

This is related to the statement of Petty C-President Francois Hollande that they are going to control and will look at the preparation of the Elite drivers in the country at the SEA Games, Asian Games and Olympics.
In PSC, it is said that in the PSC, athletes and strengthening of the accident in the country are said to have been said by Cojuangco.
The truth is, if at present, the relationship of the two officials is still good because of what happened to Cojuangco, it is likely that this will suffer in the next days.
Cojuangco released his plan for a few days after expressing Ramirez, that his agency wants to have a big part or part of the preparation of the Filipino Elite.
Cojuangco has also wrote to the leaders of the National Sports Complex (NJ) and they are asking for the names of those who are preparing for the 2017 SEA Games and Asian Games to start the training of these from January.
Anyway, if you think about it, BOC C has a responsibility to look at if the preparation of the athletes is orderly and even the formation of sports program including the funds that will be used will come from the PSC.
Don't expect the role of PSC to have a role in training because it only wants to ensure that even those who are used to make it look like the training of the national issues because they are the money of the country.
