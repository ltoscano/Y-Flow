Ninoy.

Ninoy (Mount 22-1-14) "the The Filipino-for-for." He is still alive when he went back to the Philippines, but because of his desire to return to the Philippines, he chose to return to his own welfare, but because of his desire to return to his own welfare, instead he trusted his own welfare, instead he trusted the will of God who should be followed.

In his yes, he has gone through many things that is why he is having a hard time to see his son who has been killed so that he is not recognized as the queen of heaven and land, but we should remember that his queen is a symbol of service and helping us to come closer to Christ.

Like Ninoy, let us imitate our dear doctor in faith that we should focus on what is good for others especially those who are in the bottom of society, we hope that you will learn how to sacrifice for others especially those who are in the bottom of society, we hope that you will learn to sacrifice for others especially those who are in the bottom of the society.
