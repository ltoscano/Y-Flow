In!

It is probably no longer change in the minds of the people of Talk 'Text Tropang Texters against Fil-Tongan, Moto Tantos, which will happen on August 23 at Rodriquez which will happen on August 23 at Rodriquez's Day.
This is even if it has been submerged in hornets.
In the view of the basketball player, TIDs was living together with the audience giddy.
He was also the number 1 pick on the past PBA D-League (NFL) where he was taken by Cagayan Valley RTEL) before he went to Cebuana.
It's just a waste that as a players in D's League, he did not taste the championship, Trisha Mostoles.
Well, axing, Tautasan in number 1 pick, most of them are focused on who will become number 2.
Kia is holding a number 2 pick and buyers of Norbert Torres and Troy Rosario who are both members of the RP team that won the last Southeast Asian Games that won the last Southeast Asian Games that won the last Southeast Asian Games.
Who will not be able to get this Kia is to get rid of Rain or Greg who will choose from Number 3.
Any of these two will surely give a good effect in Koponang Tety.
The two boxers he built were those who were in college as they were still in college, while they were still in college while Rosario was members of the National University Buliran, who won last year, aside from this, Rosario was members of the National University Bulos that won last year.
So, both of them had their own homes which are not like Tautism that she won't win.
That is why it can be said that Kia is also lucky to become lucky because they will surely be able to get a "winner!"
