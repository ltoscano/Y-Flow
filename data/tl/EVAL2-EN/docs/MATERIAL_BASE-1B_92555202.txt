It was successful to complain about the Leonardo Panaligan Command (LPC) - BHB Central Negros and the 144 years of Bagong Hala, 1969 until it came out of their own intelligence especially to the improvement of our armed revolution.

As the only soldier of the people of the people, it is very expected in giving true justice for more than four decades of poverty caused by understanding, opportunists and a permanent crisis in the earth and the national crisis in the country, which will be implemented in the fulfilment and success of a democratic country, which will change the fulfilment and success of the country.
The LPC was grateful for the PR and courageous kidnappers in the leadership of the Bagong Hagdan in the success of the citizens and the ability to face the victory of the citizens and the ability to face the revolution.
Despite the declaration of the Oplan LS and attack of calamity, and the corrupt AFP and PNP to destroy the agricultural sector, it is certain that more than 20 percent of human rights are added to the government, it is certain that the price of human rights are added to the government, which led to the price of human rights that reaches up to 40 percent, which resulted to the Oplan Galugad conducted in the Philippines, which is certain that the Oplan Galugad conducted by the military, which is definite to be pushed through the price of the military, it is definite that it will be pushed by the government of the military, which led to the Oplan Galugad conducted by the military.

In total, in the next year by our strict unity, we will still give a concrete contribution to our airports and human rights while the military will make their shelter while the military will make their cemetery in the countryside and will bring their weapons to the Bastes.
