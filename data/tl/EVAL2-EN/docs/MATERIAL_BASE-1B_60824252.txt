What happened is just this Friday.
There are so many people who, I have not been with each other, to stroll; we have to stroll; we have not been able to make it up; we can make it up to you, instead, you are going to make up to that, instead, you will go up to you, instead, you will go back to you.
I just do not know who.
Let's still let us go.
Just let it be.
Okay, as long as I go with what we are.
Alright, then, I will really go there, we really know.
