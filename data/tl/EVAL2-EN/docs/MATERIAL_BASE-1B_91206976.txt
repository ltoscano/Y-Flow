Quezon City Representative Alfred Vargas insisted that it was a former celebrity before he ran in politics, that the Philippine National Police (PNP) should continue the investigation of the showbiz personalities who are involved in illegal drugs because there is no need to be filed in the campaign of the government against drugs.
According to Vargas, drugs does not choose any victim and he himself will prove that he became a witness on how to destroy illegal drugs and livelihood of some artists, that is why he supports the artists who are involved in illegal drugs and help those who are involved in illegal drugs.
The lawmaker admitted that in the statement of Dela Rosa, many are afraid to clean the show business of those involved in illegal drugs, many have been scared and had a new life, which is why according to the PNP, it is still aggressive in the investigation of the actors involved in illegal drugs to finally clean the showbiz industry.
