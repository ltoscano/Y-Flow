113 million pesos to P220M they will go to BOC.
Bailagutan, August 25, 2016, we are impressed by the Bureau of Customs (BOC) Commissioner Nicanor Faura from his courage to reveal the identity of an official of BOC which is allegedly receiving multimillion pesos, "from the gravesters" since 2012.
In a press conference that was held in Malaca√±ang, Faura said that their case is strong against Customs Police Captain Arnel Bayambang which is being endorsed by millions of every month.
According to Faura, they passed the case folder of Baybayog in the Department of Justice (DOJ) for the appropriate investigation by four people who were directly hit by the Customs which costs 113 million pesos to P220million every month.
The Customs chief mentioned that the affidavit has reached her office in the first week of July when he sat in position.
However, the chief of BOC decided not to report the information to ensure the appropriate investigation.
The name of Bayambang is expected to be followed by the follow-up investigation that was conducted after he rode on the 88 kilometers east of red.
Fausto was even brought to diplomacy of Bayugan who declined the allegation that's why the issue led to DOJ.
In the x-law being treated as Bayambang, his work still continues while the recommendation of DOJ is still ongoing.
Anyway, we really need to pass through the right process.
But if I'm com Ariel Faura, I started to have a separate check in Baybayog in order for the recommendation of DOJ to be waiting for a different case.
This kind of government officials should not be left alone.
So to other people of Customs that made it hard for our countrymen, especially to those who have regular transactions in the said agency of our government, you can be moved away because it is not far from you to offer the target and insult of com Ariel Faura so that you will rot in prison.
