Monument of acting!

Hi's briefs on Roy "Mamondiong," Seiko Films.

One of the most workers in the world is our fellow workers who are only five months old in work.
They are victims of corruption and capitalists have that they are playing with the Saligang Batas and the constitution to work.
As to why the government is not able to dissolve the violent protest and let us allow billions of those who have no concern for their workers is a big puzzle.
The billions that should be reached for millions of workers if they have been regular at work are being used by evil businessmen in the improvement of their business.
Don't you notice that the billionaire capitalists have been allowed to go through the building of high buildings for those who are high-in-law, those who are innocent in condominium, who usually have five-year-old hotel and frequent casino.
Those who are ill-mannered are similar to not only in Metro Manila but also in nearby provinces.

These usually is a clear testimony or monument of a person's monument.
The election is near and it is time to campaign.
For now, there are six who are taking advantage and want to run as President. They are Vice President Binay, DILG Secretary Roxas, Sen. Cayetano, Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago, Mayor Duterte and former senator Lacson.
The truth is, the truth is painful because the six who want to become president have no concern for the poor workers of the poor victims of the constricted streets.
Because if they have a concern, why don't they not want to disband the crooked road when they can do it because they have a position in the government.
Because they are blind about the continuous abuse of the capitalists of the workers, that is why we will not be surprised if we continue to support a lot of monument in order to support.
