Change is already felt.
August 16, 2016, the level of crime in the country went down despite the extrajudicial killings along with the intensified campaign against illegal drugs of the Duterte government.
According to the report, one month since President Rodrigo Duterte took office, the crime rate at 50,817 compared to the record last July 2015, which was on 56,339, was on 56,339, in the record of the Philippine National Police (PNP).
Last July 1, 2016 was the leadership of President Duterte after he took the seat in his position last June 30, based on the decision of the PNP, which resulted to murder case against murder, homicide, rape and murder case against murder, homicide, carnapping, and cattle.
It means that the decrease of the crime during the height of the campaign against illegal drugs has a positive result of the left surrender and death of those involved in illegal drugs.
It can't also be denied that some involved in illegal drugs are behind the being called crime and because others have surrendered while others have surrendered to the operation, those who are calling the said crime will be lessened.
So let us expect in the coming days under the Duterte government to continue to increase the level of the crime.
Along with this positive outcome, everyone should be active in cooperation with the government particularly our police so that they will finally exterminate the bad elements in our society and let us have a peaceful community.
