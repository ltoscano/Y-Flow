Mariano Llanilo - general who is from Nueva Ecija to fight the Spaniards in Bulacan, Tarlac, Pampanga and Nueva Ecija.
Trinidad Tecson - "so-called" Mother of Biak na Bato, "fought against the subjugators under the group of General Llanera.
The war is dangerous to women but Tecson needs to take a courage to have guns on the revolutionaries, they will be given food and take care of the wounded.
