The tears of PNoy.

It has been more than an hour for President Benigno Aquino's speech to his fifth State of the Nation Address (SONA) by the various reactions of the country and said that there was no content of the SONA, and many have not mentioned any issue like the FOI.
But there are some who are pleased with the details about the roads and the roads where the administration has built, many are also pleased with the serious focus on the issue of the national defense, because the classes of vehicles that were bought like helicopters and High School.
Many noticed that PNoy avoided the controversial issue such as DAP, and the critics of the Supreme Court, if critics are being asked, they were not pleased because of their assumption that those who are criticizing the administration have been taken care of by the President because PNoy was called by PNoy.
But the highlight of the SONA is when President Noy became emotional in one part of his speech, it is noticeable that PNoy pleaded with the people to continue to support his administration because of the good of the country and the Filipinos.
For many, it is not ordinary that the President becomes emotional in the SONA but because it is natural for the Filipinos to be emotional, we know that many were touched by PNoy's tears.
The one I talked to is that, if you are a public transport, and you know how hard it is to serve the country of the whole heart, no one can understand the emotion of President Aquino.
In the end, we know that the support of the people for the president is not missing.
But he will be judged by history, not because of the criticism that he showed in the SONA, but for what his administration has done about the SONA, in resolving the problem of the economy and to the Philippines towards a good future.
