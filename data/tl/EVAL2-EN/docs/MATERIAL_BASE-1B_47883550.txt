An active member of CAFGU and surrendered to a democratic government town in the province of Rizal were members of the 3rd Rizal CAA and active members of the AFP who left them to return to their respective families and surrendered to the revolutionary movement so that they will go free to the company of his family in Rodriguez, Rizal.
His surrender happened last November 24, 2013 when he was temporarily freed in the investigation that his sins to the people were part of his duty and those who were asking him by his officials of CPP-AFP and those who were asking him to be punished with the revolutionary taxes

According to him, his life is not going to progress and he is always on the brink of death within almost 12 years and even if they are just doing their wages for almost 3 months, they just leave their salary for almost 3 months and even if they are just doing their income from the air, they just leave the revolutionary movement and change of their lives.

After verified, the data was verified and it was proven that he did not have any serious criminal case to the people and the revolutionary movement, he decided not to return to his family members and friends in the afternoon of November 24, 2013 in the territory of the name germs in the province of Rizal.

This way of mine by the members of PAMANTIK-ABB headed for the revolutionary movement and the release of politicians in the ranks of the CPP-NPA-NDFP members who are ready to give way and humane to any member of CPP-AFP-PNP, who are ready to give space and humane to serve the Filipino people.

It is also clear that it shows the failure of the Marcos US-Aquino and his Oplan LS's failure to surrender the revolutionary movement that is contrary to the coming days and finally leave the service to serve the citizens together or together with the New People's Bayan in the province of Rizal.
