According to the investigation of Celso Mabalaca Command, as well as the report given by the armed men, the soldiers were able to fight and have no ability to fight with the national laws of Filipino soldiers and those who have no ability to fight, Colonel Aquino and his personnel were not contented with multiple cases of violation of the Comprehensive Final Agreement on the Supreme Court on Human Rights.
This is the true face of the Oplan Tokhang at the back of those who are taking advantage of the citizens who are fighting for lack of real freedom and democracy.

It is also necessary to expose the robbery of the 31st IB, for the suspension of the citizens, they were not reported by the 31st IB, they also hide the four (4) which is being used by those with their companions in order to beat the revolutionary activities.
