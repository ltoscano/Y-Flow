Gregorio V. stars Jr.

In the Philippines, what is usually happening every year is every March 8 (Holy Week (election day), May 1 (Holy Week), on the fourth day of work in the calendar of a country (United Nations), why?

However, on March 8, on March 8, is previously assigned there.

And it is not just a declaration about women who are in the calendar of the UN, there are still others, and this is the Holy Week's Day for November 15, and the Holy Week is on November 15, and the Holy Week is on November 15, and the worst day is the Holy Week (International Day (International Day.

The terrorist groups are very important about women, because almost half of the population in the world are all female to give importance to women because each of our ancestors are from the stomach of each mother, woman.

Let us enumerate the history or from the declaration of this day.

March 8.

The Pambansang Kamao started the international day of women (International Women's Day), all sorts of date before taking care of March 8, the first date of the New Year at the United States, where women protested against the United States, wherein women protested against a bad condition in the factory.

Last 1910, in the briefing of the World Health Organization (Nov. 23) that was attended by more than 100 women from 17 countries, they were declared by women by women to be elected and elected by women (International Women's Day, which was being used by women (International Womb of women during March 8.

June 23.

According to the record of the UN, thousands of women were saved from their fervent prayer in 1994 (1994 (1994 in 1994, many of them were raped, and many of them were killed in the murder of their family in 1994, many of them were raped, and many of them were killed in the murder of their family in 1994, Pangasinan, and many of them were killed in the murder of their family.

Ban Ki-moon, "there is no woman who does not lose their right when his wife died, but an estimation of 115 people who are living in poverty, and 81 million are the physical abuse that may happen to those who have a widower and widow for them to fix their lives and to attract a huge ability to donate their lives.

October 11.

This December 19, 2011, on the 189 in-89 in a country (UN General Assembly) was strengthened, the resolution was ratified on October 11: 00 in every year is the Independence Day of Batang (International Day of the Tuwid na Daan).

This is as an expert of the rights of young women and to the new challenges that they will face, they can support the ability of the young women, and to ensure that their rights are real in this world.

The UN knows that there are discrimination still happening to young women in many parts of the world.

Although the rights of the young women are included in the Convention Center of the country's rights, and when they get to separate from the rights of women in total, they should not be separated or not being deceived by the young women in the previous administration, especially in the aspects of education, and rights of the children.

October 15.

Last December 18, 2007, through the Supreme Court (136, strengthened by the general house in the agricultural sector of the country (UN), the theme of the 119th Independence Day of RL-15, 2013), to take back and stop all kinds of violence against women and young women. "

November 25.

Last 1960, the remains of Rafael Triambillo was killed by the members of Rafael Triangillo, February 27, 19twenty-November 25, 1960, 1948-November 25, 1960, 1926, 1926, 1925, 1925, 1925, 1925, 1925, 1925, 1925, 1925, 1925, 1925, 1925, 1925, 1925, 1925, 1925, 1925, 1925, 1948.

It was a 48 / her statement for the attempt to take back the violence of women (Decongestion Program on the Ekonomopuolos of violence against Women), which was declared November 25 for every year as the international day for the burial of violence against women (International Day for the Etau of violence against Women).

Too much.

Although almost all the declared Martial Law in the UN is general, women or men, this is not only for women, so for women, to understand each other, in order to understand each other, so that their rights are neglected and almost not experience their rights.

In my opinion, Mother's Day should also be brought in the international declaration, because it is still not yet in the list of United Nations in however, although it is still not yet touched on the international declaration, it is certain that it will be touched on the heart of each person who love our mother.

In the Philippines, women know more on March 8 as the international day of women because this year has been done for a few years since it has been started by women during November 25, it has been started for a few years since November.

Even before the declaration of October 11 for young women, October 15 for women in the countryside, and June 23 for the widow, it should also be considered a lot of people in life, as long as there is still a lot of violence happening to women as a reminder to each one of human rights.

These past few days of women have not only been women in spite of the protest, but also men.

Because every right is for everyone to make all the people, whatever is his gender in order to make sure that this world has a respect for each other, the dignity and character of each one, and respect the dignity and character of each one.
