Dreams by Glen.

Every success starts with a dream.
In the United States, I met a Filipino who once dreamed and was not afraid to follow and reach them - Glen Basina, a successful real Estate agent in America.
Glen is still young when she wants to have a good life, which is why when she is given a chance, she left the Philippines in order to go to America and find her fate.
"My plan is for Two months but when I reached here, it was indeed a different decision but it was heavy for myself," he returned to myself in the start of his risk.
He also shared to me how he was extremely hurt and my first years of living in the place where he is called "Land of milk, Honey."
"The poorest person in the funeral is" Adosto, as if I have a culture shock, "he added.
Aside from Adora, the search for his job is also a challenge for him because even when he was able to finish the course of civil engineering here in the Philippines, the security guard and the caresses up his job there.
Even though it is not far from the course he finished, according to him, he did not hesitate to enter those times because he believes he will not last in that situation and will find a better job.
After a few years of perseverance, an real Estate agent introduced himself, and offered him to enter and try the world of real Estate - a challenge that he immediately accepted.
It was not long before that he became an unlicensed public agent who became a way for him to continue to succeed in the field until he will build the help of a friend with a friend who was selling land and properties in the entire America.
With the success received by Glen Basina, she asked me what is my fellow countrymen who continue to dream and work hard to succeed - and here is his answer.
