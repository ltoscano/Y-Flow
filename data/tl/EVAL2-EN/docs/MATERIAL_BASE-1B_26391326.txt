Slapping with Asukal.

It is true that it's true that there's no covetousness of our mistakes, and instead of showing humility like what Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada was done by the sin that happened in 2010, the crisis.
The misunderstanding between the Philippines and Hong Kong concluded the forgiveness of Mayor Estrada for those involved in the bloody tragedy wherein 10 people died, including the police who died.
It should have been done before by President Benigno Aquino III and former Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim to ask for forgiveness from the failure that happened, but because the quarrel has become stronger, most of our Filipino helpers are stronger and those affected are the majority of Filipino domestic helper.
Isn't it a slap to the administration of President Noynoy because the steps that he should do is owned by others to fix the relationship and trade between Hong Kong and the Philippines?
Well, President PNoy has a lot of gratitude with the former President, who insulted him in 2010 elections because of his desire to achieve the former senator that he has no idea of the Senate if he was not able to ask for forgiveness from the Senate if he was not able to ask for forgiveness.
Many of the Overseas Filipino workers in Hong Kong were made by Mayor Erap because they have not been worried about it possible to come upon their lives and state of the said place.
It would be better if Mayor Estrada brought the policemen to undergo a punishment, which should have been imposed against Mayor Lim and his officials of the police that instead of stopping the case, the case should not pass, especially if the basis is, the right eye is. "
"When the police who is" Robin Padilla "is worried, that the tourist spots is reversed while the tourist bus that contains a hostage and hostage this official?" Is this an example of "Daang Matuwid" of President Aquino.
