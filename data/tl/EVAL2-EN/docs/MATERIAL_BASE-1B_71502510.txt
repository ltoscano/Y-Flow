Rematch versus Mayweather Junior is a person of Pacquiao By Boyet Jihadist, November 18, 2016.
It is said that National Fist and Senator Manny Pacquiao frequently tell his colleagues in the Senate to get the negotiation with undefeated American boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr.
Since Pacquiao defeated Jessie Vargas in Las Vegas, Nevada this November 5 and abandoned by the WBO welterweight champion, the former senator is always present to his co-workers whose negotiation has been taken out of Mayweather.
"Manny said, to my boss, he said that he has been to Mayweather," said the staff to talk to the media because the part of Pacquiao-Mayweather fight will be put off.
It can be recalled that Pacquiao challenged Mayweather to his sanctuary after his unanimous decision on Vargas where the American boxer watched the top of the side of Thomas.
When Pacquiao went home to the Philippines, he seemed to have been collecting the fight with Mayweather because of the cut off of the two in its own face that they were implementing his jacket and Pambansang Kamao.
But when he was asked by Stella's interview in the Senate about his jacket, he said that there was no, it was just a joke! "
