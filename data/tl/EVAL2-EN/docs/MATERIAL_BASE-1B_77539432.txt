Fight for the list of voters.

The low list of private sector is huge and government about the number of those who have no work or standing in the Philippines.
The government said, around 1 to millions, including 15 years old, including 15 years old.
But for the same with the Social Weather Station, the holiest part of horseshoe, is at 11.8 million pesos.
The bystanders are giving up to 18 years old and above.
Included in those considered by the SWS, lost or fired from work, are looking for a job and a new person looking for work.
Even if they are not saying it is certain that the number of bystanders are sure to rob if the SWS number of 15-17 years old will be investigated.
King-mother, what is really the truth, make it a habit?
Aside from the problem in number of bystanders, it appears that these are really increasing.
This is in spite of the government saying that the Philippines is progressive.
Instead of increasing number of work due to the said progress, what happened and the bystanders are increasing in number?
What will happen to the country wherein while they get rich, the increasing number of people are struggling?
Another very big problem here, make a taste of hunger and other parts of the crisis in lack of livelihood.
Because there is a twin of hunger and other crisis, many deaths, especially for children who are fed and sick.
This is also a twin for the worsening of the crime, especially the different kinds of robbery which will result to the killings of criminals and victims of the authorities.
But a big problem is the failure of the government to set a corresponding program against the lack of work due to a mother-so-mother wrong count of the bystanders.
You are here in the Department of Labor Law Compliance, you should lead in helping the government to fix and make the record its record so that the problem will be effective to meet the problem.
