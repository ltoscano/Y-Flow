Sarap Diva, it will be replaced by the concert of Vice; RJ, which will just release this week.

In the set show of number NWC-list, 19, Football Federation of UP Diliman, who is currently fighting with her cancer and lying in the Philippine General Hospital where Vice Ganda stated that he also appeared from the X-Factor and included in the group of Jam.
We saw that Vice was told by Vice by the good upbringing by Vice Mayor Sarap Diva, who according to the TV host of the actor, she believes in the talent of Katrina.
That is why the manager of Sarap Diva is also wondering about the promise of Vice.
That's why our question is when will this happen although we know that Vice is super busy because the beauty queen is super busy with the The bestfriend or Single Entry SEC.
Vice is known to be helpful so in case he push through it is possible that he will not take the concert of Sarap Diva and she will donate her to those who need to spend for chemotherapy.
Anyway, including Sarap Diva is one of the number 2170 Infanta list of Mondelque is Ludivay RJ de la Torre.
Both good to sing Sarap Diva, RJ, and Monelque but RJ, is the only one who offered his new boss, Vic del Rosario, who was scheduled for release.
This was told by the victim's owner to us, while we were watching RJ while we were watching RJ in Oxford when his boss, Vic Vic is said to be good by new acquaintances in Los Angeles, USA.
We just thought that Monroque and Sarap Diva will both cringe at Sarah Geronimo so there might be a competition, that is why Boss Vic Sotto chose to have a competition.
Meanwhile, even if the good show for Rodiano is not yet full, all on a vacant table will be paid for so that they have not reached the payment.
