Good Ambassador.

An expert said, it is really good if good in the culture of Filipinos, we have a high perspective to women who are beautiful and male grandchildren.
Maybe even in other culture, this is also what they say, if the appearance is good, it will be easy to return to life and a luck that will only be used in order to just use the good and beauty of the Lord.
When Ms Gloria Diaz won in 1969 as the first Miss Universe title by the Philippines, that is also the first time of the Landing of Apollo 11 on the month, the winner of Gloria and the first chambers of people on the moon.
His partner here - America, to the moon, Philippines, the Miss Universe, was in the moon.
We know what was made by Gloria after because he was really a public number as a prime actress.
In the past year 2013, it has been a few years old when there was a great-year-old beauty queen Megan Young, who was going home to the crown year-year-old Megan Young, is the first one in front of the Miss World and Muda Datul.
The 2013 year, a lot of Filipinas who went home the crown of the beauty is the first of course in my list was Korean en Medina, 3rd Place in the Miss Intercontinental pageant that was held in Germany.
It was a member of my program Ariel Nepomuceno, I saw him grew up and worked as a good person in singing and an artist.
I salute him what he received from a direct start.
There are also Arias Arida, 3rd of his partner Miss Universe; Bea Rose Santiago, 2013 Miss International; Cindy Miranda, who entered the Top 10 of Miss Tourism Queen Miss International.
Because we have a high regard for the good things that are good, Filipinos observed the fight of the Filipina beauty queen.
