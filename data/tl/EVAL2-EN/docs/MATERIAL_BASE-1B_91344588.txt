Thank you for the true Public SERVila.

Government Works and this is what BPAT wants to prove when he is still working for him.
And this is what I saw when I visited the municipal hall of Tanay, Rizal the other day, but I was only able to go there to the hands of my fellow public service.
Thank you to Father Bong Sanchez-parish priest in Sampaloc, Tanay because he left me on the way he and Bong whispered.
The municipal hall of Tanay is beautiful and clear that you will be met by the sweet smile of their guard in the lobby and other employees.
The personnel of Asoy's personnel are very good because they should be able to see each other, even if they do not know you, it is the reflection of the good location of their mayor, Rafael Belga, co, and other municipal officials.
The process was very fast and they are really going to support you to Wilfredo Espanol, of the astigmatism's Office, he is patient in answering my questions and he dispelled my fear.
It's because I went to the municipal hall to know if the papers of a lot that was selling to us has no problem because many have said that there are many cases of cases here in Tanay.
Norway, I have no perseverance while walking on the papers, because the process is so bad but, I am really happy with the speed of their service in Tanay.
Even in the Provincial capitol of Rizal, as well as the kindness that I have experienced from their civil wedding, the leaders are going to face even if they have not known each other, even if they have not known each other.
It is very kind to desire to serve their residents.
DILG Secretary Mar Roxas and Mayor Del de Guzman admitted that it is not only Marikina is a good example of the public service and good governance, including Rizal Provincial Government in their use to the public.
Thank you to boast, and Provincial Tristan (LGU-1090451, you was impressed by me!
