This is the opportunity by PNoy.

This is the first time of PNoy to show herself to the people especially those who were hit by the urge of typhoon Ruby.
I will also forget that the revelation of PNoy, "Zero," I will let him show now her running fast in giving help to those who are affected.
Where are the followers of PNoy?
While others are saddened even if the said storm is still outside the Philippines, some of the tribe of PNoy are very happy because this is a chance to use politics.
As a matter of fact, even before the storm will hit it, Roxas will be able to finish this tomorrow maybe Vice President Jejomar Binay will be the one to turn around to our countrymen.
But let us allow the two because they are really not known to each other that the goal is to go to them the throne that is left by PNoy in 2016.
When Yolanda was surrounded by Yolanda, the declaration of the administration of PNoy was slow, the foreigners before, even some of the Non-governmental organization (ALS).
Mister President Noynoy Aquino, maybe what happened to our fellow countrymen who are devastated by Yolanda is not what happened when Yolanda hit us, show it back to us, show up your whole capabilities.
They say that Yolanda is more stronger than typhoon Ruby so it is just right for PNoy to have a comfortable help to PNoy.
When will we still find a new czar, czar, like Secretary Panfilo Lacson to hasten the action of the government of PNoy?
It is right that the sweet words, the attack of the government is right, that is why what is needed is right now!
