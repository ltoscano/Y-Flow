I am in the right path.

A unique strategy is being used today by Mar Roxas, the leader of the Department of Interior and Local Government.
Silent but full of action and helping is done today by the wife of Korina Sanchez may it be in the time of calamity or in running his department.
It can be clearly seen how much of PNoy is, because he and he just leave up to Roxas, that everyone knows that he will bet on the son of Tita Cory in the 2016 presidential candidate.
It is also clear that the oil that is being done today by Roxas is also clear because even if he is slow in style, it seems that he will be treated and going to the right.
In other words, this is what Mar is doing and that is what is needed because the current administration is currently on top of the top of Vice President Jojo Binay.
For the knowledge of all, the force of Senator Alan Cayetano, Antonio Trillanes and some close to Roxas who is a member of the Liberal Party is successful to destroy Noguera.
For now it seems that even if Binay will not destroy it, it seems that he will not get up because of so much negative impression to the public.
According to this, what happened to Binay to former Senator Manny Villar that he was also a victim of pretending to block last 2010 presidential election.
Aside from Cory's death before, which was the reason for PNoy to be crushed by Ping Lacson, which became the reason for his former to be negative or negative.
The only thing that Binay is in is difficult for now, he reached double and double the fight compared with Villar that's why it is impossible that he is impossible.
That is the lesson of politics that we should just ignore because this game is really the fight of the cunning and without the age of ALNAs Womb of Alvin Feliciano.
