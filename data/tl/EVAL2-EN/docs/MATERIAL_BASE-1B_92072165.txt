No need to think of this.

On October, the Land Transportation Office (LTO) will be implemented on the number of plate number of high policy that there is a fine of five thousand pesos and it is possible that the vehicle can heal.
Your servant does not notice to those from the Land Transportation Office (LTO) in the time of PNoy, it seems that, whatever it is, they can think of whatever confusion to the people they do not care.
You can find a different kind of plate number of vehicles that we can see.
There is an old green or red plate number, with four numbers, those who use ice cream numbers, has an ally and Special Action Force of the government.
If the vehicle is involved in a crime, a plate number is involved, but if 10 Filipinos have written it, it is difficult to remember, how long can be remembered, how long can be remembered, how ten numbers (1384-520), what was placed in a plate?
Isn't it that the LTO is thinking, if ever there is something involved in any accident or the run of a vehicle, we will find it hard to remember the plate because there are many numbers and hard to remember, that is why because of this, there will be no one to run over and be run over.
One more thing that can happen is that there will be a holdup inside the bus or taxi, it is certain that the plate number will not be remembered, if the number of plate number is like that.
Your servant has a question to LTO officer-in charge of Alfonso, Junior, and with his good upbringing, that is why you can show to the public that you can read it, especially when it comes to 10-ten numbers?
Hopefully, LTO should think thoroughly about their steps so that for the good and it will give importance to all the good results of all, your servant / Dr. Humalig).
