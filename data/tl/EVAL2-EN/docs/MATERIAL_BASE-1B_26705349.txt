Governor and negligent of OFWs in Libya.

I have a friend who is working in a big company, Aroroy, Libya.
Its salary is enough, for the education of her children, construction of his second home after a fire consumed the first and little relief for the future of his whole family.
He is one of those that the government is saying that they are hardheaded in following the alert level 4 or forcibly evacuation of the 12,000 remaining Overseas Filipino Workers who are both hardheaded.
And it is likely that he is one of those waiting for the emergency evacuation action of the government after they experienced no assurance in the life in Libya today.
The government is blaming the OFWs in their stubbornness but the government should be blamed for the incident.
Why?
Because, a mother, pet oy, the government has no offer to exchange for the income and condition of the OFW.
There is a twin alert level 4 for the loss of the government of other things that could avoid stealing such a lot of land, vessel and air for OFWs.
He does not have any things, the government's promise to shoulder all expenses in the evacuation because they cannot see all the people who go to OFWs and help them escape.
Those who are unaware, that many people are afraid to travel to the OFWs so how can they fulfill what they are doing?
Now it is now caught in the rape, severed head and taking advantage of the OFWs as a result of what we say is extreme negligence and always late action by the government in this crisis.
Nevertheless, all the pointing of finger, negligence and all of the reasons for the OFWs in the severe crisis in Libya will be set aside.
Instead, everyone needs to act, in other way, in order to save all kinds of danger to the OFWs from all kinds of danger.
