Libya, what is happening with the Philippines is clearly seen.

King-mother, what is happening to our Filipinos is not funny.
Do you know the same picture of the Philippines? In Libya.
"Isn't it that someone kidnapped and beheaded by Overseas Filipino Workers in this country of Moto Gumba?
... that our government has declared alert level 4 for them or forcibly their evacuation?
Many still do not want to leave and go home to the Philippines.
We are dead if dead.
What really is, they feel nothing to come upon the Philippines but hunger and suffering.
Others said, it is better that you will die in Libya with a bullet than you will die from hunger and difficulty in the Philippines.
That is the pain.
And that is the improvement of our OFWs in our country.
With what is happening, make sure that our government itself should have important lesson.
One of those is the giving attention by the authorities on the situation of most ordinary citizens.
What is happening is, the authorities even want the fight to fight than serve the citizens.
And what is the worst argument of those who are rude and fatty foods, no one else but the struggle for power in the government.
Because, in having power, this is with the privilege of enriching them.
And there is no "Tuwid na Daan or the crooked road.
It turns out that if the government loses the government before, this is still the same time now.
There is no change.
There is only in the Disbursement Acceleration Program, king-mother, 90 percent of this is given to the lawmakers.
But DBM Secretary Butch Abad denied about this.
Another thing is, DAP was really used for the Philippines not to progress but to progress the number of high-ranking officials of the government and their followers in big businesses.
There, millions are being driven out for other countries to work even if they were transported to other countries and will be hit by intense war on all of all war.
