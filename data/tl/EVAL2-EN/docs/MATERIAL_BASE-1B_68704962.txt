In Mata.

"In Mata of the child (Less. 10: 24-24) to show her child to their wealth, we were living with a rich father in the province of the farmers, and we were not seeing the beauty of stars in heaven while they were still rich in the roof and they can see all the roof of their children.

"We are not rich and Daddy i'll always be in a hurry to work in order to earn money," the children who have no knowledge in our society, the people who have no knowledge in the kingdom of God, "the children who have not noticed them from the kingdom of Jesus."
