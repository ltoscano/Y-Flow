How can you stop Binay?

Up to now the camp of DILG Secretary Mar Roxas, Senator Allan Cayetano and Senator Bongbong Marcos, how they do not know!
This is because it is an analysis of political crises of the country especially that Binay becomes more aggressive in the latest Social Weather Station (SWS) survey conducted last week of March.
It is clear in the result of the SWS survey that despite the defamation of Mar Roxas group or the LP and Allan Cayetano of NP, who is obvious to be the president of the country that they do not have an effect on the barracks.
It can be clearly seen from + 73, or there is an 82-year-old boy, as part of the public's love, which is why the bet of LP and NP are clearly seen.
It is obvious that Binay won't be moved by any defamation he will throw at him by his enemies even if Allan Cayetano started to make him good in the television where he just copied Binay's gimmick last 2010.
People are thinking about the money used by Cayetano in his announcement on TV because it is obvious that he has a mix of politics.
The game of politics is slow, so it looks like this is the bet of Taguig that is why the people should be observant.
2016 is still far so it is certain that there will be a lot of defamation to Binay and that is what is anticipated because that is what the citizens are looking for.
Um!
Are the people in Taguig to the administration of Cayetano?
This is what should be thought about by little by little because it is possible that the said announcement of the will of the couple Allan and Lani Cayetano is just a vehicle to get up in the rating of politics.
The people of Taguig should talk about their real state because if this gimmick of Mister Allan is just all his gimmick, the people will suffer if the president gets elected again.
