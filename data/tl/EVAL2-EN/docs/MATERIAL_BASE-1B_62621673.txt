Walk.

Walk (Less. 14: 25-33) ride or walk, what you choose, you will easily sweat, you will reach your destination if you are carrying, you will not have difficulty.

If you walked, you will walk even if you have an umbrella when you are from a market, and if you are from a market, you might be able to plant and will not be useful anymore.

If it is rainy season you can read your feet and if you are not sure that you will surely smell, you will not be victimized, you might be victimized by those who will choose, ride or walk?

Jesus chose to walk, not only that, he chose!

Jesus: "It is not possible that I can be a man who does not want to be a priest, not just following me," it should be first compared to Christ, you should stay alone while walking, at the end of following him, the Day is waiting for you.
