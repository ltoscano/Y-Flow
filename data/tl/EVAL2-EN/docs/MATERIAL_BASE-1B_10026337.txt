Daughter (Less. 15-10) you still remember that that is not only one of us who is not just waiting for her own father and she is the one who is looking for her to be a lawyer, but when we go back to God, she is the one who is looking for her to be a lawyer, but when we go back to the house of God, we will still hide that we are safe and having fun.

So that it is right that our conversation with God is right, our hiding place is right now that he is just looking for you!
