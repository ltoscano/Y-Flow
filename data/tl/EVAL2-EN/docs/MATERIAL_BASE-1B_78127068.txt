One boat!

We are pointing out by China, that's why it's just right that we put it away with the conflicts, bad or anger at each other to face the huge damage to cover our territory.
We are very familiar with China, they think that we are just like that because our country is small because our country is small, and our population is small if compared to those who are rude.
China threatened that we will be tasted because of the incessant rain there in the ocean going to AyPanatag Shoal which looks like those who were hit by the great Chinese are claiming.
Maybe there are also politicians who prepare for the negative perspective about what our government is doing under the leadership of PNoy?
The truth is, I am calling the management of the tribe of PNoy but this time, I am an ally in him as a Filipino who is being attacked by a giant China.
Okay, PNoy!
If the Philippines is at a disadvantage with the Philippines, especially those who are going to vote, China should not forget our history if we will be used by Spain, United States and the country of the accident.
It is painful to think that what we are going to happen or any country that will come to the war but this issue is a clear violation of freedom of our nation.
That's why if I am from the tribe of PNoy, we have entered an agreement between other countries that China is also warned by China like Vietnam, Malaysia, India, Japan and Indonesia.
China might have thought that they get all of the size and strength of listeners because it can be considered that the small and weak people can make that they will not be caught.
Well, China is really desperate because even if the reason is to make the justification, they still force to follow his vices to his neighbors.
