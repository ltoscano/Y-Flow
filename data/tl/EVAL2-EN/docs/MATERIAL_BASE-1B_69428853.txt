Senator Antonio Trillanes IV wants to revive the commission that has been killed by the Supreme Court.
For what else, for Trillanes who is the former military, it would be better if he will build a national commission to investigate those involved in the P10 billion pork barrel scam, is it not enough for the investigation of the Department of Juvenile (DOJ) and the Office of the Ombudsman?
The trial against Janet Lim-Napoles, the wife of Jimmy Napoles, who was former Major-Armed Forces, and the high-ranking officials of the government Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Benigno Noynoy Aquino III, will continue to continue the suspension of a national commission.
Will the DOJ and the Ombudsman still wait for the decision of the commission to file a case against Napoles and his considered accomplices in this scam?
Trillanes wants to end the commission of the media or officials of the media or chief, of the professor in university and by the judge and Justice.
I am sure that no one will agree to be a member of the National Commission on media, it is enough for them to be the responsibility of the journalists, through the broadcast media or newspaper.
And how much will their salary be, it's the media, acadic, and to be considered?
Reccited this will be the decision of the Supreme Court and the really investigation is the Ombudsman.
"We need to know the truth about this scam," said Trillanes.
It has been a long journey, and it is still expensive but we may not be punished with those who are guilty.
Just dismiss the proposal of Trillanes and to the Ombudsman, and in the Sandiganbayan, make sure that the people might feel bad.
