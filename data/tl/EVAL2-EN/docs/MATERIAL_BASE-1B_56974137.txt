Just a fair journalism, and not a parachute was asked by the Duterte administration in the international media related to his campaign against illegal drugs.
He / she said that foreign businessmen are so lucky that the first drug personalities are being given to those who are killed as drug personalities while the hundreds of thousands are giving up to undergo rehab.
As long as it has been an effect of OFWs because some OFWs in Saudi Arabia already have an effect of the OFWs from Saudi Arabia due to other ex-workers.
Appointments is not in Saudi nationals coming from overseas but to other foreign workers in oil and Rich Kingdom.
The person who made an insult to the OFW is based on the report of an OFW Organization in Riyadh, because most of them are drug addicts.
Of course, there are really a lot of 3 million people that the government is saying to be drug addict but let's just let the Filipino be more than 100 million now.
Supoing.
More than 3 million, they are not trying to sell the majority of Filipinos who are mad at drugs and all crimes caused by it.
Let's.
Therefore, let's go back to the issue of OFW who is uya in relation to the drug issue, just to avoid trouble and just a little bit of cold.
The problem of all.
Let us not be carried away by words that we know is not true in the First area, OFWs want to earn money and not to enter trouble.
Avoid arguing, maybe it is enough to say that drugs is a problem in all of the country and there is no one who can tell the drug-free school of their respective countries.
If the person you are talking to will not be measured.
Camping on Twitter or Twitter-list), if there is something to send to the authorities, it is an email about the authorities, just email about the talk of OFW or called 551-5403.
