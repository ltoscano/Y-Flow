Awra, left the mother.
10, 2016.
Before Awra became famous in the same time, FPJ's, Propaganda of the province and movie The Super Parental Guardian, he had a lot of difference in life at his young age.
Witness her story in the MMK this night in ABS-CBN.
Still a child, Awra knows that she wants to be an actor like her idol Vice Ganda.
He is supported by his favorite adviser of all things.

They accept who and what is he as a person.
But the happy family that he was looking at is that it seems that her mother was left behind by her mother who is Marivic (Altareros).
He quickly changed his father, OPLAN al (JO del Prado).
His father neglected him.
Awra has a hard time because she grew up with the understanding and kind of his father.
How does he know!
