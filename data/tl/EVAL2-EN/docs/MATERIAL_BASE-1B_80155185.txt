More than 23,000 have been piled at the offices of the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA), this is a problem now by the MMDA as to how many traffic enforcers are confiscated from their positions, which are alleged to have been confiscated from the motorcycles (75.8), (13700) and Asian Utility Vehicles (ALS).
According to MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino, in the number of cases, a building has a high level of eight floors or it is a bridge that can also create boats from the country and will be beneficial.
The MMDA is now planning to step down but the Land Transportation Office (LTO) will still need to file the evidence if the owner of the company might be charged.
This is what LTO should be careful and not, the MMDA is best to coordinate with the LTO to give a solution to the applicants who are applying for a new plate number.
If the LTO has no action against the committee, the MMDA should continue to pursue them from selling them and the removal of the dirty walls in EDSA.
