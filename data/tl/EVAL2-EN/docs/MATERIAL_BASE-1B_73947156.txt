PNoy, noon.

There is a number of pieces of criticisms that President Benigno Aquino International Criminal PNoy recently stated in Malaca√±ang, in front of those assigned to the lawmakers, well, he has a sermon to the critics and media?
Mister Aquino, the person is trying to step down and admire people who are doing well, good and beautiful but if what you are doing is wrong, they are just lucky if they are not stupid!
For example, will the passengers of MRT and LRT are admirable if there is always trouble and damage, will the passengers be happy?
How can the motorists be happy for two to four hours, they are on the roads of their vehicle, are they going to give DPWH Secretary Rogelio Singson and MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino to the violent traffic that reached the Expressway?
Can they jump out of joy from those affected in Mindanao and Visayas Region which are since they were devastated until now, you do not have the secret given to them?, do not claim the rice, clothes and food that were given during the height of the storm, most of the people of the world!
And in the issue of criminality, it is not enough to blame the past administrations that have passed since you said, the criminals and criminality are still there.
It is true that there are criminals who are members of the national police, are you proud that they will be proud of them by CPNP Alan Purisima?
That is their work, right!
Are you going to blame the media and critics if, the media is white when your service to the country and the people are right, if you are sensible in the governance of the government, it is certain that all sorts of things will be harvested.
You themselves, in the new side of you, PNoy, especially the social sector, especially the sector of the media, but just a few months of working in position, you have seen your real personality.
You are saddened, it is funny because your term is almost over, ZEve, your right service! "RTECAYETANO).
