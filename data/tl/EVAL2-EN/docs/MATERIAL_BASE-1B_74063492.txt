Ex-AFP Regional Committee as an actual excuse that does not succeed in the Bureau of Customs.

What if they only have a good taste of fruits, the palace was given to the Bureau of Customs (BoC), which is a big reason to fight the CENT RL-old corruption and charge on the agency.
Perhaps, the retired General of Armed Forces did not step down on the west-off of the division first in the Bureau of district, that's why it suddenly took place to the management of Babag-C that's why he suddenly took the official line of Malaca√±ang before he resigned.
The Filipino and Purisima immediately appointed the new replacement, with the commissioner (NBP), who got pulled out of the camp of the retired National Hala of military.
Perhaps even if the Palace will deny it, they are assigned to destroy the many syndicates that are taking advantage of the government's profit from filing charges, law Enforcement Agency, Aspera and operations of the Bureau of Bureau, which is part of the corruption that the former generals can enter.
They have been put in "actual box that won't be done by military agency (Customs), and were fired by leaders who were all career (Customs) and were fired at the CPA, chemotherapy, etcetera).
There is one year since the contract of the generals can be given a year, but they are not included in the cake that they might come from DBM, not to the Revenue, which may be the one-year contract of former ex-General who will only renew the one who is responsible for him to be an ally "in the Bureau.
In the 2014 released by the Bureau, which is estimated to be P42-billion pesos in their targets, of course they have a graft case, and why are they being charged by the Ombudsman, what are they being charged by the Ombudsman?
Because they are afraid of possible retaliation?
