Disbursement Acceleration Program in the leadership of the 3rd Towerville, Maj. Paul Tiongson, broken plate.
Like the broken plate number of the 3rd Infantry Division, Philippine Army in its statement through his spokesperson, Maj. Paul Tiongson, that the Supreme Court has already declared the highest movement because there are many members of the Bagong Hala Bayan (BHB) to show the Oplan Galugad conducted and the military continues to get the increase of funds.

This March 29, 2014, along with the anniversary of the Botchok (VMMC), the military has met the alleged two members of the Bastes under the Central Bank of Panay in order to prove that the armed forces are depending on the mass and what is important is to snatch attention from the mass media on the day anniversary of the Bastes.

No matter how many times Maj. Paul Tiongson insists on his statement, the fact that the fact that the martial law failed will not be hidden in the goal of the armed forces and the ability to launch the revolutionary movement particularly in Central Panay.

It is very confident that the PCommander Commander Isnilon Hapilon is confident under the management of Jose Perciaga, Jr. Command in Central Panay in order to intensify the offensive of the advancement of Filipino people, while the rise of citizens who were devastated by the typhoon Yolanda is ongoing.

Mabuhay po, Bagong Hala Bira!
The citizens, to step down, file a case against the useless Marcos regime because of its neglect to the victims of the typhoon Yolanda!
