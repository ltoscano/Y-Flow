(Pilipino Star Ngayon), PO2 44; UPP-June 7, 2015 - 12: 00am.

The Land Transportation Office (LTO) is slow to distribution of new plate number before, they are blamed for the broken plate, but now it appears that they are the one who has a defect when they cannot fulfill their promise with the owner of the vehicle with a new plate number.
Even the 45 days to send a plate to the former owner of the vehicle, they were not able to conduct a passenger plate number and after a 45 days, it appears that the number of vehicles collided with "1: 00 in the main newspapers, it appears that not only 45 days or 90 days or more than 90 days or more than 90 days or more than 90 days or more than 90 days or more than 90 days.
Someone suggested that the LTO will just return to P400 to those who will renew the vehicle, it is said that this is the request of Isabela Representative Rodolfo Albano said that this is not just the advice of Isabela Representative Rodolfo Albano said that this is also the way of LTO to release a new plate number.
Albano should not be impulsive in giving back the payment of those who will renew the vehicle to know if he really has a confusion when the car owners should have fought back then and it is not now that LTO has already paid for a lot.
What the lawmaker should do is to force or hasten the LTO to be delivered to a plate number. Kasim off the LTO because of the failure to be delivered to the plate number within 45 days.
