Do not give up.

Good things coming there to those who believe, the more good things coming there to those who are waiting there are those who are waiting and receiving good things are those who are not giving up and are not giving up.

Like the love, you should not believe, instead you are doing it.

You are not just waiting for the actions of others to love you, you themselves are the ones who have no surrender and it is difficult for you to lose hope and live in every moment not to fight and die in every moment, do not fight and avoid the truth.

Never, do not surrender and accept life who is moving to your own sake also to meet other actions, instead of always expected, looking at others, and think that there is a possibility that will happen in waiting.
