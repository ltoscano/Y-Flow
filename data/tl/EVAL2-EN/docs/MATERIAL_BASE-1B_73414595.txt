The Bureau of Immigration (BI) was released by the members of the Bureau of Immigration (MILF) and the intelligence division of the agency due to the complaint that some of them were blackmailing them with foreigners in the country.
According to Senior Charles Calima, all the intelligence chief of the BI, in total, six employees, three CA and Jo were hit by the immigration law.
The official said that the CA and Jihadist were not doing anything right because it is not the permanent employee of the department, the immigration law is only being used by the intelligence and immigration law that was only used by the intelligence and immigration law of their permanent employee.
Calamansi are already conducting an investigation on how the said temporary treatment of the agency should be implemented.
