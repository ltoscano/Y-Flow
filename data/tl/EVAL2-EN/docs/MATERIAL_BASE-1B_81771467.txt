Banquets.

Banquets (Lay-13-30) there is a story about a father and son who lives in a hurry.

The father has long been taking care of sickness for a long time because her son is tired of taking care of him, so he thought of bringing his father going up to the mountain which is why he was able to bring his father to death while the road was being attacked by his father while on the road.

The child asked his father for why he attacked the branches.

It depends on your work if each one is ready to accept it.

That is why his call is: "You insisted to enter the narrow door," the Lord, who wants to be with all his children in his house, but he did not want to be with his kingdom, which is why we let us eat, no pork barrel, and no pork barrel!
