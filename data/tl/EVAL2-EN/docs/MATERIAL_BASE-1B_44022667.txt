It is the money.

I have read the statement of Akbayan as the 25th anniversary of the celebration of the EDSA People Power Line, Maguindanao last January 25 in the middle of the worst scandal from the group of Akbayan from the group who took advantage towards the group who took advantage towards the group who suffered from the legislative chamber.
In the case of Mamasapano, the call of Akbayan as Aquino: "Insisted on his solid leadership from the issue and made justice to release the whole truth and to give justice to all the victims of the Philippine National Police-Special Action Force, not included in the Philippine National Police-Special Action Force, not included with many Moro who were killed because of the operation - rebels or ordinary civilians.
But it is more important point: The root of blood is not in any details of the operation, but also in its whole plan, it is important that the government of the US will pour the rules when it is suspected that the government of the US will destroy those who are suspected as terrorists, according to Glenn Garcia and other investigation of the Korean.
Of course, Akbayan also felt the collar of the statement regarding the people who attacks Aquino: "In the planned transfer of the country for the change of society, because of the new opportunity to continue the development of the country in the other hand, it is certain that the development of the country will continue for the progress of society."
But where is the evidence of those concerned about this?
The statement of Akbayan regarding the Aquino government is too much against the reason, and even if it is not complete, the people who speak with the current system and the government are being treated, who is the one who is an expert, who is the one who is an expert in the struggle for change for change.
