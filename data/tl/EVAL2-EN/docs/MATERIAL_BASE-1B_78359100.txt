Money by Jum!

Four senators got P370 million in the height of the impeachment of CJ Renato Corona, "that was the new report revealed to Mister Juan, and those who were given to the said millions were Senator Jinggoy Estrada, Bong Revilla, Bongbong Marcos, Bongbong Marcos, Bongbong Marcos and Vicente Sotto.
It is said that he came from the fund of the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) that like the pork barrel, the use is also considered as illegal.
Why is it that in the time that Corona is on the time of DBM and his Opposition, they are still doubting!
But, not only now but the issue on DAP has been discussed for a long time and this has been mentioned in the previous Senate hearing.
The DAP, according to "not stop the gossips in the past, was used to give bribe to the senators to ensure the identity of Corona.
Now the gossip seems to be cleared about the question, what is said to be P370 million DAP fund, which is how long the truth will come out on the back of the said senator, as long as the truth is slowly coming out regarding the robbery in the country's funds.
After the P370 million fund released by the said senators, what would be the next thing we will know?
It is certain that there are still a lot of foolishness of women who are concerned about the country's leaders but the truth is, they are suffering for Juan.
Because the truth is, Juan is the money that they are playing with!
