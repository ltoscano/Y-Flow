The Filipino masses is still unlikely for the filipino masses.

"It is good that DAP was right when the basis is right, the result is right," this is what President Noynoy Aquino said on the 23-minute speech in the television last Monday night.
These words are not given to many Filipinos especially to the poor who are now continuously experiencing poverty, what is the means of DAP, what is the style of DAP?
There was no clear statement about the President that's why his speech was finished and his speech was left with what the President said, that's why they did not understand what the President said, that's why they did not understand one of the DAP! "
It is not surprising because what the citizens want to hear is where the funds of DAP were really good, and if how much was the funds of DAP, this has a good reason to hear how much is the pork barrel scam, Janet Lim Napoles benefited from the DAP?
The President also said, there are many people who benefited from DAP through construction of infrastructure and funds for important programs of the government, but like an answer of the price of rice, there is still no change and the increase in price of rice is still difficult, and the increase in poverty has been submerged in poverty.
The DAP was unlikely for the filipino masses to be understood even if the President already spoke that this issue will be clear if one will enumerate the funds to go there and not tainted with corruption.
