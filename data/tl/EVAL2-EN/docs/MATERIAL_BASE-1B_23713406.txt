Lined up!

"Comedy will show the show of the Senate blue ribbon committee in the hands of Senator TG Guingona.
"The PPP or is planning to plan, where even if they are waiting for it, it seems like a imagined politician, will he run for a higher position in 2016 election?
Senator Guingona, your strategy is a failure, at the forest, you showed the foolishness that you showed as a chairman of the committee, you have released a decision that you do not even inform about your members?
And why is it that when Senator Jinggoy Estrada and Bong Revilla went out, you are afraid that you are afraid of your father, that is how the enemies in Malacañang?
My goodness, there is no doubt, in the election that you are now in the election right now, our money to pay tax "the true problem of the country, you do not want to face," the center of the case, you do not want to face. "
Your future should be how to help solve the problem brought by China in our territory, but not in your brain.
You should face the mysterious disappearance and destruction of fake food, bones, things, medicine, things and financial help from our countrymen and foreigners.
You should keep on why the worsening traffic is worsening, the fact that the criticisms against Malacañang, DPWH, DSWD, DILG and those who are involved in Malacañang, DPWH, DSWD, DILG and those involved in the agencies that have passed, are still useless, the promised help that has been implemented by the victims.
It's because you are all politicking and your headache is not in the contents of your head but we are on our side, we are on our side, we also call it.
Anyway, your plan is simple, you want to make sure that the next leader of the country is an ally so that you will not be punished after your term, it is unlikely that it will happen, that you are just one of your faces, those who are like that.
