Millions.

Congratulations!

It was known that even before, it is more popular today, which is why there are many people who visit more than one million which became a witness to the Panagile Festival in Baguio and it is good that the number of those who have been witnessed this February.
The streets are small, and it is only small that the holy Week is still small, and it's as if the flow of tourists in the area is getting worse, and it is possible that the Department of Tourism (DOC) should be prepared for the next celebration, and it should be better for the Department of Tourism (DOC) and it should be better for the Department of Tourism (DOT) in exchange for it to worsen and completely destroyed the Baguio.
What we are saying is Kalinga, because of the beauty of Baguio, because it is also a cold and very rich of culture that can be given to tourists, local or from other countries.
What is the implementation of the implementation of the law for those who are from Kalinga, they also have jobs for them to be noticed and given attention only recently, many were able to use and give attention to the newspapers, which can be used by the DOT, which can be used by the DOT, which can be used by the DOT, which can be used in Kalinga.
What are the tourists looking for a cold place during summer.
So that the influx of million visitors will be lessened, it would be good for both in Baguio and Kalinga.
