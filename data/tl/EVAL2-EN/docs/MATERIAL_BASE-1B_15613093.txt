Become the protagonist right! To fight.
By Bam Aquino, September 1, 2016 for the protagonist, one of the hot topic now is a heated discussion in the town and Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) that is scheduled on October.
The argument of others, just after the national election last May, the time for the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) for the barangay and SK elections is too short.
Some lawmakers want to postpone the election of two years and do it in 2018 so that it will be prepared for it to be prepared for a proposal that there will be a proposal that this has no benefit and has no help in the community.
As one of those who fought for the Republic Act Number 10742 or Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, Co who sponsored the 16th Congress in the Senate, I cannot accept the proposal to postpone the election for two years or to separate the SK Pendatun.
That's why we are asking for the reforms in SK Pendatun to keep it from a former system full of corruption and does not do anything for the welfare of the youth.
The reform presented should be wasted if we will not be implemented in the soonest time or if there is no SK Pendatun to implement it.
Let us not be impulsive in our decision, why don't we give the opportunity to attract the reforms and see if this will be effective for the current generation.
