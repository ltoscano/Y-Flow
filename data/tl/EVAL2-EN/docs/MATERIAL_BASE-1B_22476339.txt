Help for the OFW.

Many Filipino workers in other countries are in danger of danger.
There is a Filipino who works in an oil companies that was kidnapped and beheaded in Libya.
There was another nurse who was kidnapped and alternately raped in Tripoli wants to escape after getting away from the rains and bomb in Libya.
There are still a lot of Filipinos jealous because they are stuck in the war.
Not only in Libya, there is a war but also in the Middle East and Ukraine where we have a lot of fellowmen who want to go home but taking a conflict when they do not want to die.
But, the government of the Philippines is lacking in the ability by the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) that they are brought home immediately.
OFWs have forgotten their lives in order to send dollars to the country.
The case of life is only one of the problems of the OFW, aside from being abused, the family and having children whose path are destroyed because their personal guidance is gone.
Last 2010 elections, Noynoy Aquino promised that if he will file a lot of jobs to have many Filipinos, a decent livelihood in the country, with its help, many will not join.
But until now, the number of leaves of the Philippines continues to work in other towns.
The government is very happy because OFWs in the economy is a big help.
Where is PNoy's promise to have a decent job for the mother and father to leave the Philippines and leave their children?
Many Filipinos are trapped in the war in Libya with two minds to return to the country because there is no assurance if they will live in the Philippines.
Many OFW also said that it is better to die from a bullet that is why the eyes of the hunger in the town of Juan is covered in the corner of Juan.
