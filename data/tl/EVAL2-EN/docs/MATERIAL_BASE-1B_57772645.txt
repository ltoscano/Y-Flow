Eking and priesthood: Reflection of the Holy Spirit-April 24, 2014 - is the year of the Century.

I am still young when I was taught to wash the hands of my parents before eating when I want to serve the feet of Christ, that is why we want to serve the feet of Christ, that is why we want to serve the feet of Christ, that is why we want to serve the feet of Jesus, "that is why we want to serve the feet of Jesus," that is why we want to serve the feet of Jesus, "that is why we want to serve the feet of Jesus," that is why we want to serve the feet of Jesus, "that is why we want to serve the feet of Jesus, which is why we want us to shape into the hands of Jesus," that is why we want to serve the mouth of Jesus, which is why we want us to shape into the picture of Jesus.
