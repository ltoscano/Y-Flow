Mayor Petilla.

It is just right for the Senate to investigate what is done by Palo, Leyte Mayor Remedios Petilla, which is being thrown away by "relief goods" which should have been used for Yolanda who were not able to wait for.
Where will you earn, make sure that while he is experiencing severe hunger and lack of clothes on his jurisdiction, the inhumane things that was given to her as the help of Yolanda victims will be sent to him as help.
Onse, Philippines-year-old living!
Let us listen to the answer of Mayor Petilla; that is why when he was assigned to the trash, it is said that the said food and clothes are increasing.
Okay, Anzon?
It means you have given a donation or the relief goods that will be implemented, or broken?
Is it really nonsense, is the government or Ndonned that will bring you up to those who do not wait for alms?
Is it possible that only the pirates have been destroyed or they are just destroyed while you are in a warehouse?
Which is while I am shocked from hunger, thirsty and lack of clothing, you have chosen that those things that are from the storage of the said relief goods?
They were about to finish this life, but they did not neglect a lot of donations, the problem is because there was no "heart, liver, and balancing at the elected officials!
I am hesitant, I just want to worry about you, make sure that it is Mayor Remedios Petilla who is the mother of energy Secretary Jericho Petilla.
The statement of Secretary Jericho Petilla, this mother promised that he will be driven or resign if he will not be able to return 100 percent in Leyte and Samar before Christmas comes.
The promise to bring back the electricity will not be fulfilled if Secretary Petilla did not fulfill his promise to be driven out of the position!
"That, the caliber of a mother, Petilla.
Rape, they are the ones given to us or the big poop of the Liberal Party!
