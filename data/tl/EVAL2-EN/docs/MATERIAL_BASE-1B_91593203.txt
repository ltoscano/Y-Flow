Frankly so, Alan Peter is too good.
By Ellen Toribio, September 18, 2016, I am really impressed by Senator Alan Cayetano.
You can imagine that no one is thinking about the senators in the hearing of the Senate regarding the events of extrajudicial killings related to the campaign of President Rodrigo Duterte to resolve the credibility of the witness Edgar Matobato.
Matobato said, he was a former member of the Davao Death Squad (DDS) and he already joined a lot of operations in killing the command of Duterte, there were some who were killed with masking tape. "
Cayetano made sure that he catches the different ehek of the tape and what he said to Matobato, "you told us what is the tape that you used for what you killed."
The different arehek and tape that Matobato took was the packaging tape.
Kilos Pronto!

Matobato's credibility has been destroyed.
Cayetano really is really good, he said he knows that Matobato is not telling the truth when he was told with masking tape "because he did not seem to stick with masking tape.
"Cayetano seems to have not thought of all the Filipinos like toothpaste," coldness, "Coke" all refrigerator, "krrrik, all cameras," Pogi "
Atty. Nena Santos said, "in Maguindanao massacre, the witness, who had a non-call, car, car, pick up, all trucks."

Matobato's stories are severe because he was killed by 50 people.

It was there, when they fed the victim with the crocodile so they could not see the corpse.
He was being involved with Duterte's son, Paolo, who is now Vice-mayor of Davao.
Some of those mentioned by Matobato were similar to the former speaker Proseso Nograles and the family of the killed owner of the hotel, Richard King.
