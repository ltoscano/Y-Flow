Gambling in Macau is gambling.

The employees of the Provincial City of Manila were so happy when Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada promised to his State of the City Address (SOCA) that their salary will increase and aside from being a disturbance.
But they called a high-ranking official of the city government, not because of often he is not in his office but because of often there is no time for the documents of the employees to get salary in the right time.
Their salary has been delayed for almost a month, that's why they cannot handle it, and they should have been able to make it because they will be able to catch the employees because of the buying of their needs, we can no longer finish the price of goods.
According to an information from the City Hall, it is said that there is a high official who does not have anything to do with the ears of Mayor Estrada for different projects that will give them to Macau to China to gamble in casino for the last week with three more money one hundred pesos in Manila.
Wait, do they leave?
After all, these officials are going to know that they are from Hong Kong.
It can't be seen in their passports that they came from Macau because the boat they were riding in the said area is just low.
My goodness!
It is good for the DILG and the Office of the Ombudsman to investigate this.
In case it is true, Mayor Estrada is pitiful because his name is being ruined because of the foolish contract that is brought to the city hall.
