Don't commit suicide!

I do not make Yan! (Mt. 10: 17-17) that Christmas is over! That is what you will hear from many people but in the calendar of church, Christmas is until the first Sunday of January., but until this is the Christmas season?

Christmas is the arrival of the birth of Jesus, the Lord who fooled him in order to make sure that this is the real meaning of Christmas for the whole year, if you have been happy, do not stop going back to the whole year, if you have become happy, do not stop going back to the feelings of sadness in the whole year.

If you gave a gift, be generous to the whole year, if you are going to church and prayed, continue the forgiveness of everyone if you do not have loved, do not make it to the whole year!
