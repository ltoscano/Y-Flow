Senate, Kamara) and Supreme Court!

Let's in front of Pulse Asia about enriching it.
In the next generation, can you include the Palace regarding the trust rating or trust of the citizens in the legislative chamber, Senate and Supreme Court.
If you will not do this, you will surely have learned how to know how the people are, including me.
Hmmmp!
According to Wallis, the trust of the citizens in the Senate and House will be hit while the decrease of their trust in the SC is small.
From 100 people, the trust of the citizens in the Senate went down from 42 last December 2013 until only 31 last June.
From the 46 votes, the Supreme Court went down to 42 years.
Based on the rating of this agency, the Supreme Court received 49 votes, the Senate is only up to 33 percent while the legislative chamber is only up to 34.
Because of the lack of interest or the approval of the SC, the SC has only received 13 while around 23 are in the Senate and 21 in the legislative chamber.
Because of the lack of trust, the burial of the Senate in the vote of 20, Chamber - 19 and SC) 10 will be highest.
In total, the votes of the Senate and legislative chamber are going to be hit while the citizens succeed in spite of the SC.
If you think about it, these three agencies go down because they do not even have 50 million votes because they do not have any kind of work and trust.
In case we are not allowed by Pulse Asia, the government agencies should wake up, especially the Senate and Legislative Chamber.
How can the citizens trust and coordinate with unruly senators and congressmen who come out if they are almost all of the crooks who have seen them.
Or you are the ones who take advantage and dresses, hey, you are taking advantage of all of you!
