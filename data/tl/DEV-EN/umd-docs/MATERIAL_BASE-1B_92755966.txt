Became restless

To savor the good health in the body and mind, to continue the prosperity and chances to cause happiness in his own family and even in their own communities, even mapagpayapa of all, and expose the truth.
There is a need to anyone to discipline and stop the his own mind.
Maligalig because this is when the masalimoot life and Panatag when the life.
If able to control the his own mind, you will discover the kaparaanan in awareness, and all the kawatasan and kawastuan voluntarily in the mood for.
There is no reliable waiting and always nakatunganga to others.
The taguri palaasa, this is a burden, and negligent in yourself.
The true and only makakatighaw only to your pagkauhaw is finally wake up and act for your own sake.
Without any help from you if you have not yet help yourself.
In the end of your hands what you want your success.
Avoid yourself to be included in the sleep, she was sleeping, and nagtutulog-beds in the course of your life.
The path is going to poverty and danger.
Imulat the eyes and stay awake all the time.
Huwang when wait and always hoped that act, while it is still early.
Before it is too late and be a victim.
