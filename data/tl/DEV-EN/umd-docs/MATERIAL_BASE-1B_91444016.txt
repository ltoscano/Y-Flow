A picture of the Japanese nagpupulot of their scattered after their game against Ivory Coast in the World Cup, where they lost, 2-1.
When already defeated, cleaned.
Rushed the praise of their actions.
Showed the world the meaning of concern, and discipline.
Many bumilib to them.
I am sure that there is no other country should do that, except if imitate since now.
Know the Japanese to discipline, order and obedience to the authorities.
Last hit the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, of those who survived the lined up while waiting for help from the government.
As of what happened in Leyte and Samar, a few hours after the typhoon Yolanda.
Is very far.
Many we should learn from the Japanese.
But there were more comment of the wrong with the actions of the Japanese.
The "wierdo" they.
Not used to see the cleaning of their place this year.
Magkalat and pinauubaya used in the scheduled to clean up.
In other words, is not a problem, so do not care.
If this is what this year, I can't do anything, but he should not speak is in the making it well.
There is a need to the need of our culture this kind of discipline.
On the road, you can see what they are throwing scattered everywhere.
The upos of cigarettes, shrouded with a candy, botelya of mineral water and too much food.
Garbage is not a problem, that's why only tapon anywhere.
In the relihiyosong gathering, the mountain-mountain of garbage have somewhere to throw.
And if it flooded in napakakonting rain, the government is going to blame.
If only half of the whole population in the Philippines has the kaugaliang like the Japanese, napakaunlad that maybe we.
