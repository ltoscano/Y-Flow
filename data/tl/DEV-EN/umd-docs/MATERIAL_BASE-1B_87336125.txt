We have information that only one of the killing that this is related to the sale of illegal drugs.
We have a particular interest in the case of Federico Erivera (who was killed last October 4) and Jinky Estrada (who was killed last October 11) happened because it is not far from the camp of the 22nd Infantry Batallion in Sityo Bungsaran, Rizal, Gubat.
