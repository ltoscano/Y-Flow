Heat: Tabuena success still By Al S. Mendoza June 24, 2016 covered by NBA finals the attack of Miguel Tabuena in the 116th US Open golf championship.
I have no maalalang Filipinos who were able to enter the US Open that aside from Tabuena.
Will be given a golfer makalaro there is a chance to also ticket to the Olympic Games.
Through the eye of the needle, Tabuena.
To reach, Tabuena in Oakmont, Pennsylvania, severe challenge his experienced.
But the two torneong allocated for those who want to magkwalifay in the US Open, who was Tabuena.
Both in America did the eliminasyon and pinaldo of Tabuena the enemies in California.
I still cannot believe "almost," Tabuena said.
I really dream "makalaro" in the US Open.
One of the poorest golf course the Oakmont.
He has no water but full of sandrap.
Singkipot alley of the fairways.
But on the first day, fight, Tabuena in his 4-over-PAR 74.
There were not enough luck in his Second round 80 and he'y did not pass the final 2-round.
Far from 147-cut his 154.
However, he is still admired in the US Open, which was won by Dustin Johnson, Americans.
Tabuena'y 21 and is still far from the reach.
The makasubok him in the US Open at a young age is an experience you can be proud of my life.
For me, he is also the success.
