May change

Posted by: Nelson Forte Flores on April 25, 2016

Many are react in my last column, I said that it is possible to change Senator Ferdinand "" ituwid Bongbong Marcos and the mistakes of his parents in the time of martial law.
Some of the readers we said that I have written on the column because I did not experience the of domination of the Marcos dictatorship.
The should be admitted Bongbong in the sin of his family and ask for forgiveness to the public.
I am saddened for this kind of comment because it is clear to me that this is a type of the closure of the mind.
First, is a big part of the Filipino people experienced of domination in the time of the dictatorship and with us in this area.
But I do not close the my mind to get to know a leader with potensiyal changing of our society no matter who she is.
This issue of the progress of the country and not my personal feelings or experience.
Should not be ikawing in the son of the father or mother.
I have a feeling that she would be disowned the hypocrites only their parents because of mistakes.
One more thing, I believe that can be learned from the mistakes that Bongbong was done by her parents.
It is good to change towards a creatures like Bongbong even though I also did not removing that he may not have learned.
However, as a Christian, I am susugal in the belief that he changed towards the goodness.
Again, I will repeat... should not be ikawing in the sin of parents because if that happens, nobody has the right to handle the renda of power.
All of us are also victims of the mistakes of our parents or by their parents.
What do you think?
