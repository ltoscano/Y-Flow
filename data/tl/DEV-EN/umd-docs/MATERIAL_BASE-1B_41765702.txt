Be settled in sports

These past few days, spilling the feelings of the Filipinos about basketball.
There are many went here in the Philippines that international basketball superstars and they impress all of the affection of the Filipino fans of basketball.
Even the fight of the UST and La Salle became emotional and all is almost watched.
It is really sportsminded Filipinos.
That is why it is tumitibay was my belief that it is a big thing to have a so-called sports tourism.
I am still sinulong councilor, the Sports Tourism in Quezon City.
I pushed for the event like the QC vs. the World Billiard tournament and the QC Chess Road show where the tourist spots in the QC made the fight.
Not only basketball can magpasigla tourism in the Philippines.
The boxing is leading, the amount that our superstars in the field.
The bowling, the billiards that we have a lot is famous.
We can also be spearhead of water sports and show us the beauty of the beach in the country.
There are still a lot of places in the Philippines that good destination and perhaps, is a big help to the famous sportsman, we are weak and introduced myself and help for the growth of the tourism in the country.
The potential of tourism in the Philippines, especially if the famous athletes that promoters and more beautiful because the story of the lives of our athletes and it is true that can be an inspiration to anyone.
The government should take advantage of the fame of some of our sports people to makaenganyo of many interest and a lot of attention in the Philippines.
If it was won by Pacman of his endorsement is a senator in America, just think what he could help in the country if she will talk, and the athletes like him, in the whole world about the beauty of the one you love our country Philippines and to encourage the other race which include the our country in the they plan to go to as tourists.
