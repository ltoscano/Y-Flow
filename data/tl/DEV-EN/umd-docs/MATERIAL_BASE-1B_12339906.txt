In fact, she is really support to the campaign against illegal drugs of the Duterte government because even some of the private sector and non-government organizations (NGOs) is nakatukod.
But despite the success of the government of Duterte in the campaign against illegal drugs, covered the problem in the crime.
Along with because of the intensified campaign against illegal drugs, there are a lot of dark is happening that will be saddened over too much of our countrymen because it is not paid attention by the government due to the pagtutok in the war against illegal drugs.
