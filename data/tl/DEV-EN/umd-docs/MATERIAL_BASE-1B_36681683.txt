Doubt in DOTC

Almost a billion peso is missing in the Philippines in the controversial decision of the Dept. of Transportation & idiskuwalipika Communications that a bidder in fare Automated Collection System (AFCS) project-for the Metro Rail Transit (MRT) and Light Rail Transit (LRT).
This is the true: Even the embassy of the country, Turkey, there is a negative reaction because of the controversial "to disqualify" in E-Trans Solutions that partner of Kentkart Turkish to the company.
Reports of our countrymen from E-Trans Solutions, more than P800M the height that they will be given to the government compared to the offer of elected bidder that AF Consortium and pumangalawang SM Consortium, and it seems that almost have talked to their respective "" bid.
The more nakadududa is the "disqualify" of DOTC in E-Trans Solutions because of the things that'y "technical", which is why he found out the ability and how much the offer of for the treasury of the country.
That's why even DOTC was not included in the agreement, "" if ever?
We cannot be blamed if there is doubt, Turkish Embassy Commercial Counsellor Cezmi Besogul, who also wrote to DOTC Sec.
Joseph Abaya, as a protest and the reversal of the fair treatment, the E-Trans Solutions that partner of Kentkart that respected company in Turkey.
Should examine the "bid" of E-Trans Solutions to maikumpara in "bid" of elected company and the people saw what more advantage for the government and the Filipino people.
This is the true!
