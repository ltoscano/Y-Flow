Remember the golden's?
In my kaedad sunshine the memory of gold's.
This is the time that the Philippines is flourishing in Asia in the field of sports.
At this time the like of Lydia de Vega, Elma Muros, Paeng Nepomuceno and many others who gave a recognition in the country.
The simple tactic in gold's.
Cultivate the sports where there is a potential when the country and tumuklas tumuklas athletes who can give medals in the country in the international competition.
But that is a long time.
A long time retired the athletes who became famous because of the golden's.
Also went away for a long time that the Philippines on the principle of gold's in a simple reason.
This is the result of inedeya during the time of the former President Ferdinand Marcos.
It's because he sees the beauty of the principle of gold's.
The only thing is who only saw the mind or perpetrators.
The golden's is a program that binangkuhan of the government.
Have shed and paid attention to the program so it will succeed.

But now the Philippine sports is dependent on "had accompanying drizzle" coming from the private sector.
Just shadows served as the government and the leading to bumabaston is the big companies that there is a principle and his own interest komersyal.
It is not wrong to help the private sector.
But the shape of responsibility is in the government.
As of now, only small, the funds of the government in sports.
Can't it constructed of a World Class facilities, which can maipagmalaki in other countries.
Even the turnover of the athletes are not good for a long time, that's why't before finding the potential to athletes.
The result of all the ito--ang the continuous decline of the Philippines in the field of sports.
