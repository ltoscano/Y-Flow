Serious negligence in Filipino athletes should have to face PNoy

If the katubusan by President Benigno Aquino III "Noynoy" desmayado citizens to him, I think it is a big'y recall if he will face the widespread problems in the Philippine sports.
The number of our great athletes in the country.
But not nasusulit from because they were neglected.
Millions of the funds of the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC), which is headed by Richie Garcia, but where to?
You see, we actually nagkamedalya, but fact.
KULELAT at the Asian Games?!
Like the pain in the head n'yan.
The size of funds but fact?!
Especially in the Philippine Olympics Committee (POC) headed by Unlce Peping.
The size of the funds do'yan but we do not have binesa compared to other countries.
In our opinion, you should probably panghimasukan of the administration of PNoy the worsening downfall of the athlete us.
If the huge fund inilalaan d'yan fact but we just always, then disband the PSA and POC.
Or Better yet, replace the kinakalawang leading d'yan.
But before change should be Audit the Commission on Audit... now, try to us from of Madam Heidi Mendoza, Madam Grace Pulido-Tan... Pakibusisi n'yo in his team the PSA and POC... T'yak kakasahan of Madam Heidi "that!
