Ebola agapan; Philippine Contingent, OFW PAUWIIN election

Should the government quickly moved to saved by the Filipinos in the Ebola virus disease in the countries he has.
This should not be hesitant or umubos that for a long time in making decisions for maligtas is 115 Philippine Contingent in the United Nations Peacekeeping Force that nakaistasyon in the country of Liberia.
Should be included in the save this has the total 4,200 that overseas Filipino worker which can be found in the country and the country from Sierra Leone and Gunia.
The these countries, parekoy attack, with no drugs and deadly Ebola and announced the government of the national emergency that their situation because of the number of deaths in them.
Should't imitate of the government of the Philippines other countries naglikas of their citizens from the said country even before the mahawaan of the sick and die.
In many times, always late, parekoy, the government in saved the OFW in the ongoing war in other't other countries until magkaipit squeeze the them, together with the government.
It can be considered as kasingbagsik of severe war the Ebola who is in need of forced evacuation.
If not quickly decide and the government, King-mother, it is scary to think if there was infected with this move and died when an OFW.
Like what happened after pugutan of those from Libya a man OFW and reypin a Filipina nurses.
If not for the government to act and pauwiin's possible for the Philippine Contingent and OFWs and infected, it is scary when pauwiin.
Should alalahaning without any ability the government to fight the Ebola.
Maybe magkandapeste-pests were still Undersecretary.
Eric Tayag if we were able to enter it.
This is no more clear program what the things to do this in case we actually illegal of Ebola.
That is why, while there is no bad news about the Filipinos in relation to the Ebola, when the government should take action.
Or to you, you are stupid.
Pwe!
