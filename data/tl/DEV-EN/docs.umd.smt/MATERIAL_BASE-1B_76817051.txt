Christmas is happy!
By Chingbee December 22, 2016 right to Dec.
25, Christmas Day, for sure, will the balikbayan boxes brought or be sent by the OFWs in the Philippines for their loved ones.
The day will be the start of Christmas because the tax-exemption of balikbayan boxes that the contents costs P150,000 of OFW or balikbayan.
If you notice, we cannot say that of P150,000 balikbayan but of OFW or balikbayan because the P150,000 is total Value of tax exemption of delivery or of going home.
P150K total so, someone might think there to send three boxes to the Value of each one balikbayan, or a total of P450,000 P150,000 for three boxes.
It is not something'n "that, okay?
Anyway, it is a huge favor the given by the administration of the tax exemption that P150,000 P10,000 only because before, the Value of the contents of the balikbayan boxes is not pinapatawan taxes.
Just the same, in every year, it can be avail the OFW or balikbayan of P150,000 balikbayan box tax exemption of the three times.
Thrice, hence, in a Year, the three availment of privilege can be P450,000 that this is the price of goods that can be tax exempt.
It is not absolute the privilege because there are conditions that are impose in order not to use the tax exemption for BoC dutiable goods.
The condition should be personally just effects to the contents of the balikbayan boxes or "those item used to (secondhand) or if before it is used by pangpersonal send or sent.
Non-commercial not also be commercial the quantity of be sent.
For example, ita-tax "that the Customs if P150,000 worth of perfumes the contents of your balikbayan or P150,000 worth of alcohol.
To be safe, the maximum you'll just two items of category.
For example, two bottles of perfume and two bottles of alcohol.
MORE blessings Truly, the Christmas of OFWs and returnees because of the tax exemption of balikbayan boxes, the disappearance of tanim bala scam in NAIA and extort more orderly operation of our airports.
