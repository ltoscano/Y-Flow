The weather bureau is like a taxi

Even if you call it PAGASA, the truth is we do not see anything hope in our weather bureau.
The taxi, by any other name, is the taxi still if you need to, and if there is always no, you do not need.
A Rose is a Rose by other name.
A wheelchair is a wheelchair even if there is no one sitting there.
It is the first time.
The color coding does not need to know if the weather was bad.
Now, there is still a warning Thunder PagAsa.
The bad thing, millions of money to the budget of Pag-asa and asking for the additional.
It is not the fault of the people.
The tatamad that they look up to the sky to be noticed if there is a nabubuong bad weather.
Maybe there is no hope when he saw the people in heaven, in heaven, pinadidilim of corrupt in the government.
Before, if there is a coming typhoon, siren is needed.
Not siren in the sea, but siren, or hugong is needed.
Life is simple.
There is no need to spend the government in the wrong-wrong forecast of the phenomenon, just like the color coding in the typhoon and Thunder warnings.
A sound of the siren, we know that typhoon signal number 1.
Two sound is stronger if the storm.
And three more severe if the storm.
Now, we are hoping that the radio and TV hoping to PagAsa hoping to fortune.
The said the PagAsa, there will come a storm.
If not reached, then we are lucky.
Wow, naturally, and of course, you do not need the weathermen or the Undersecretary and asec and Secretary of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) to know if there is a storm or not.
But the storm is different now that the name or nickname.
The storm, before, is the storm by any other name.
Now, there is a LPA or low pressure area and there are monsoon Rain.
Previously, the nine-nine does not want to stop the strong rain.
Now, the call of PagAsa is a miracle.
