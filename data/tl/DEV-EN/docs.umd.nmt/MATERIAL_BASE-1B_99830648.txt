Heat: Butch back PSC By Al S. Mendoza July 1, 2016 in return of Butch Ramirez as the chief of the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC), expect significant changes in sports.
If before the PSC just leaning on the Pagcor when it comes to its funds every year, Butch's strategy is different.
Aside from the Pagcor, Butch also made the private sector to support the talahugat and elite sports.
That is also not new but in the intention of the private companies again, the funds of sports will increase even more.
Though the contribution of the Pagcor in PSC is also a big contribution, "undoubtedly, it is still lacking.
It is expensive to search for a new talent in the countryside.
And it is more expensive especially the treyning.
The house is not yet included in there, food and supplies of our athletes and coaches.
The PSC is in good hands because of Ramon Fernandez, a pillar not only in basketball but in the leadership of the direction.
I worked with Ramon and really hanep strategize.

Butch is lucky to him.
As well as Charles Maxey.
As former sports editor of SunStar Davao, his knowledge in sports is wide.
If Ramon and Charles I personally know, Fatima Kiram and Arnold Agustin are a foreigner.
But because Butch is ig, we expect the two to be okay.
In the leadership of Butch, our athletes seem to be pleasant tomorrow.
