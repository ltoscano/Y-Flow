Heat: Uytengsu kambyou, July 4, 2016 in almost unbelievable reaction, Wilfred Uytengsu, became calm in being fired by his child Calvin Abueva in Gilas Pilipinas.
In the midst of fierce opposition of many of the decision of coach TAB Baldwin to remove Abueva, ignore Uytengsu, the boss-Chief of Abueva in Alaska.
"It is not being followed always what we want," said Uytengsu in English.
"But our support in Gilas is no mix of politics, rather this is pure love for the country."
In the question if Alaska player will still borrow from the Gilas after the "inappropriate," yes "is the answer of Uytengsu.
"We are whole heart supporting the Gilas," said Uytengsu.
"Abueva is a good player and we are happy with him and for Team Philippines."
Previously, Uytengsu is cruel when it comes to things controversial, like the case of Abueva.
I was almost not able to talk to someone who was not mad at the removal of Abueva.
As well as the reaction to the way to leave LA Tenorio: He had disappeared.
"Though our heart will be crushed, we are still proud of Abueva in his calmness due to the events," said Uytengsu.
It seems that I do not know Uytengsu: Since he will be criticized going to the sheep.
From aggressive going to retreat.
It's going to be different.
All really changed.
