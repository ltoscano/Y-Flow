Be armed with information on the campaign against illegal drugs Enero 21, 2017 in continuing campaign against illegal drugs, it cannot be denied that this fight of the government Duterte will gradually be found.
Even though the government admits particularly the Philippine National Police (PNP) there are many more to clean up the success in war against illegal drugs.
However, despite the perceived success in the campaign in illegal drugs, it is sad that there is a joining force destroying the good goal of the PNP to walisin those involved in illegal drugs.
This is due to the involvement of some officials and personnel of the PNP on the abduction and murder of the businessman who was arrested using the campaign "Oplan Tokhang".
It is clear to the information coming out that the group involved in the crime is used to the illegal drugs of the government to earn because they have been asked for a huge money in the camp of the businessman in exchange for freedom of its freedom but eventually discovered there was no life.
These kinds of events are alarming so the public is important to be alert to syndicates or corrupt policemen who use Oplan Tokhang or Oplan Taphang of PNP in their illegal acts.
So it is important that we are armed with knowledge about the right process of this campaign by the government to not reach the plight of the businessman.
As part of the process is the formal invitation to an individual, especially if there is a complaint through the letter.
The police also cannot force the invite because the invited has the right to refuse and get a lawyer who is going to defend.
