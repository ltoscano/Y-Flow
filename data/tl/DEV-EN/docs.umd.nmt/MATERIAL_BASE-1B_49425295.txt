Focus (Lk.
10: 38-42) Father Mike is miraculous.
She is thinking far away.
The miraculous is not in the inside.
He said: "Kunin and rice it.
This is my body that will offer to you. "
The sacristan came closer to him and the said: "Fr, mikropono is what you are raising..." that is what happens when there is nothing in yourself, when there is no concentration in doing.
Self needs to be whole in doing so not to lose.
The heart needs to be there and mind so that you can't shout.

That is what Maria did.
Meanwhile, his brother Marta is balating anxious and is very busy with many things, Maria gave himself listening to Jesus.
He was able to focus on Jesus and no one else.
And that is not removed from him.
Don't shout.
Just focus.

Concentrate.
That is why...
