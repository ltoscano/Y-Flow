SEAG, PARA games plan to steal By Ramil Cruz June 16, 2016 Plano of the host Malaysia to steal the 29 SEA Games 2017 and the 9th ASEAN to Games 2017 in August.
19-31 of the next year.
But this is just suggestions, that ASEAN needs to agree to Sports Federation and National Paralympic Committees.
Paralympic Council of Malaysia is communicated to the suggestions of both NPCs in the recent meeting, along with the Philippine Paralympic Committee (former Philippine Sports Association para sa pagpayag erently Abled-National Paralympic Committee of the Philippines).
The PCM reasoned, the magkaiba-abled atleta will be exposed to a bigger crowd in their event (APG) aside from the media coverage like the elite atleta in SEAG.
PCM is also inspired by the 20th Commonwealth Games last 2014 in Glasgow, Scotland when the same for the main program was included.
It is practiced in the past eight eition of APG that it is not being done with SEAG.
The 8th APG 2015 was last held last Dec.
3-9 in Singapore then by the 28th SEAG 2015 there was also June 5-16.
But it doesn't sing like some of the acceptance of the idea.
According to the President of the PPC Michael Barredo, he will consult first to the atleta, coaches and skatetions before they release a position that will be submitted to APSF.
"Ako ay personal na hindi natinag na sumang-ayon sa isang joint event dahil sa mga logistical isyu.
"Karaniwang umaabot sa limang araw kada tournament pero kapag pinagsama-sama ng SEA Games, ito ay kahabaan ng 10-12", he said.
"Sinubukan na ito ni We na kapag may edad na si We stada National Games side By side kasama ang PNG (Philippine National Games) pero ngayong taon, hiniling ni We na maghiwalay na ulit si We dahil sa logistical problema - tulad ng scheduling, transportasyon.
Hindi ko alam How ang ibang bansa pero kung ano man ang magiging desisyon, susuportahan ni We ", he panapos.
