NCAA all of the Star Game: Libre para sa lahat at 3-point shootout By Elech Dmercy August 12, 2016 will lead Rey Nambatac the West against East in the NCAA lahat-Star Game in The Arena in San Juan later.
But the bet of Letran Nambatac has other roles, to keep the crown of the Three point shootout in their school.
The throne was vacant because the champion of the past year Mark Cruz of Letran is playing now in PBA.
