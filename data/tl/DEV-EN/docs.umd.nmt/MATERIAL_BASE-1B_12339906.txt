Call to President Duterte By Jeanumang Lacte Nobyembre 4, 2016, we believe in the slowly success being harvested by the campaign against illegal drugs of our President Rodrigo Duterte together with the Philippine National Police (PNP) and even the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).
In fact, the support in the campaign against illegal drugs of the government Duterte is really pouring because even some private sector and non-government organisasyon (NGOs) are also able to join.
But despite this success of the government government in the campaign against illegal drugs, the problem in criminality is covered.
Along with the strong campaign against illegal drugs, many serious crimes happening that are extremely saddened by our countrymen because it seems that the government is not paid attention due to focusing on the war against illegal drugs.
Just like a call on Facebook of a Luz Sarmiento Leonerio who is a native of Zambales.
Here is the entirety of the call of the netizens Miss Luz.
"Nananawgan will be q in the president to not only do drugs on your focus on the province of our province who was murdered because of a hold-up and one of the close to our family was done by hold-up just like a chicken was killed.
It is also a D teacher in the town of the other and the country of Botolan that happened the entire Zambales.
That is just D that is widespread in our country.
Because no matter how many of them do not get killed, they will not stop.
The hold-up is definitely spreading so it is only a pls. if the person in the town loves you in the past and the police will buy the people to take care of the country.
Marming thank you!! "
This is only one of the things I know there are so many calls to be watched in social media everyday that the President and the PNP will be given attention to the criminals who are taking advantage of the people who are taking advantage of the busy government in the fight against illegal drugs.
