It's going to be a plastic surgery.

Maybe many will be surprised if one of the collection of tourists going to China is the "beauty industry" they there, particularly the plastic surgery.
The Chinese are going to be nahuhumaling on vanity and because they are having an extra "pambili" because of the growth of their economy since the country opened the door for the world, the improvement of the "beauty industry becomes positive."
And it becomes even more komedyanteng to go to the tourists in China.
But according to the report to the pahayagang China Daily, there are more Chinese national who are still capable of the neighboring country South Korea for the same beauty service.
So, if many tourists go to China to make paganda, there are more Chinese who go to South Korea for the more advanced technology of beauty enhansemento surgery.
What we are pointing out here is the various ways of the pull of tourists.
If China and South Korea have technology for the beauty enhansemento and they are using it to enter the tourists to go to their country, what we have?
Our beauty enhansemento guru like Vicky Belo and wife Calayan example are also famous.
I have friends that every time will come home to the Philippines from other countries, with the one they will always visit to visit Belo and Calayan klinika.
It is said that it is cheaper here in the Philippines and the "pet Pinoy is still different."
Speaking of "pet," is not that and here we are known in the whole world - in our being loving the people we care for, mapa-domestic helper or medical practitioners.
There is a strange brand of affection and care for Filipinos.
So like China and South Korea we will benefit from our husay and talento for the improvement of tourism in the country.
If the plastic surgery is too controversial for us, there are many others that we can push and push for, if there is only a support of the government to help tourism and contribute to the economy of the country.
