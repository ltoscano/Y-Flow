We can: Wish for the New Year By Harvey Keh Disyembre 30, 2016 two days ago, and brought by the opening of another new year is a new hope for every Filipino.
This is also the time for us to return this year to look at the important experiences in our lives and the important lessons that we have learned.

If there are any important women who will look at us from the year 2016, this is his lessons so that we can further improve our lives.
Next year, one of my aspirations will have to prevail and peace in our country.
I hope to stop the left killings happening now, especially since many innocent children are implicated in it.
Aside from this, hopefully the culture of death in our country will be stopped and the death penalty cannot be approved because we believe that each person has the ability to magbagong life.
Another thing I wish for the New Year was supposed to push through some important promises of our government that made it to the end of this year.
Included here is the free treatment of the poor in the hospitals to be implemented by the Department of Health (DOH) and giving free tuition fee for every youth to study in the State Colleges and Universities in the whole country.
If this will really come true, the entry of 2017 will be good for every Filipino.

For the end, I hope for the new year we will not visit and hit big accidents like typhoons that seem to be growing every year.
Many of our countrymen are still continuing recovery from being affected by some typhoon passed by us this 2016 so hopefully they will recover again in their lives.
Before the new year entered, we allocate time with our family and loved ones to thank our Lord for the past year.
We also pray for our country that peace will prevail in the entire Philippines and the lives of every Filipino will continue to prosper.
A happy and happy New Year to all of you!
