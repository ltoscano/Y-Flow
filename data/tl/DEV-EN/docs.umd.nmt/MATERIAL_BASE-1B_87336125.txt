The movement has nothing to do with successive murders in Gubat and Prieto Diaz.

Samuel Guerrero Celso Maware Command - NPA-Sorsogon October 18, 2014, 2014.

We would like to answer the questions that we receive about consecutive killings in Gubat and Prieto Diaz, Sorsogon this past two weeks.

First, the revolutionary movement has nothing to do with the said events.
We are also conducting their own investigation in order to solve the meaningless crimes.
We have information that even one of these murders is related to the sale of illegal drugs.
We have a particular interest in the case of Federico Eilog a (which was killed last October 4) and Jinky Estrada (who was killed last October 11) because they took place far from the camp of the 22nd Infantry Batallion in Sityo Bungsaran, Rizal, Gubat.
We have long received reports about the involvement of officials and soldiers of the Philippine Army in pushing illegal drugs.

It is possible that the killing of this October 15 to Alan Figueras of Barangay Panganiban, Gubat because both the style of salaring riding a motorcycle and armed caliber .45 were both different.

Whatever, we would like to send it to the families of the victims that they could come to help us with sadness and solve the said cases.
Any information can help that they can provide for our investigation and kamtin justice for the victims.
