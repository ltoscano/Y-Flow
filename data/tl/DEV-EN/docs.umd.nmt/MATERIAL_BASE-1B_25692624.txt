Those who are bidding and in DPWH bidding... Hoy!
You are embarrassing!
By Eralyn Prado Nobyembre 22, 2016 called by Senate President Aquilino "Koko" Pimentel III that the report of a few district engineers and regional directors of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) started to conduct the bidding of projects for the next year when the proposed 2017 budget or General Appropriations Act (GAA) started to conduct the proposed 2017 budget or General Appropriations Act (GAA).
That is why Pimentel called DPWH Sec.
Mark Villar will investigate this and if proven true, the corrupt officials involved in this irregularities are immediately removed.
"IT is BOTH Nakahihiya at deplorable kung bakit ang tiyak na DPWH district engineers at regional directors ay schedule na rin ang pagsasagawa ng mga gawaing panlipunan para sa mga proyekto na pang-opisyal ng Kongreso at nilagdaan na By ang Pangulo sa batas," according to Pimentel.
According to the senator, "if there is a fees to the Bureau of Customs, there is also an obligation to DPWH," that the senator is referring to the "padulas" which is allegedly given by the winning contractors in their connection to DPWH.
