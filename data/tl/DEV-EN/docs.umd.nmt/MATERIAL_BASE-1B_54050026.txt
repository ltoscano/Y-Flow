The weather bureau seems to be a taxi.

Whether you call it PAGASA, the truth is that we don't see any hope in our weather bureau.
The taxi, By ANY ibang pangalan, is still a taxi that if you need to always be there and if there is, you don't need it.
Umangat ang isang rose By iba pang pangalan.
Silya ang silya kahit wala namang nakaupo doon.
It's good when it's the first time.
The color coding is not needed to know if the weather is bad.
Now, the PagAin is going to have a Thunder warning.
What's bad that is, millions of money is the budget of Pag-Ain and asks for additional.
It is the fault of the people.
They will be lazy to look at the sky to notice if there will be a whole bad weather.
Maybe the people in heaven can't see anything in heaven, in heaven, which will even worsen corrupt in the government.
Before, if there is a storm, there is only a siren in need.
Not a siren in the sea, but Siren, or hugong needed.
Life was simple then.
The government does not need to spend the wrong pagtaya, in the phenomenon like the color coding in the bagyong and Thunder babala.
Just a sound of a siren we know that it is a bagyong signal number 1 already.
Two sound if the storm is stronger.
And three if the storm is more severe.
Now, we are just hoping for the radio and TV who depend on the PagAin hopes for destiny.
The PagAin said, there will be a storm.
When it doesn't come, we are not lucky.
Wow, naturally, and of course, you don't need the weathermen or the Undersecretary and asec and Secretary itself of the Department of science and Technology (DOST) to know if there is a storm or nothing.
But the storm now is different names or name.
The storm, before, is a storm By ANY ibang pangalan.
Now, there is still a LPA or low pressure area and there are habagat Rain.
Before nine-nine calls, the strong rain does not want to stop.
Now, the call of the PagAin is a miracle.
