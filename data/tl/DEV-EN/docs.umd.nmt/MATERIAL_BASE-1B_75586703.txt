Can you still remember the gold Alis?
In my age, the memory of the gold Alis still clear in the sun's rays.
This is the time that the Philippines is prevailing in Asia in the field of sports.
During this time, the same as Lydia de Vega became famous, Elma Mblangko, Paeng Nepomuceno and many others who gave honor to the country.
A tactic was simple then in gold Alis.
Cultivate the sports where the country has the potential and discover that the athletes can discover that they can provide medals in the country in the international competition.
But that was a long time ago.
Athletes have been retired for a long time to be famous because of gold Alis.
The Philippines has long been away from the principle of gold Alis for a simple reason.
This is a result of the inedeya during the time of former President Ferdinand Marcos.
Because the beauty of the principle of gold Alis not seen.
The only one who only saw is who thought or perpetrators.
The gold Alis is a program then that the government has been able to sell it.
Invested and paid attention to the program in order to succeed.

But now the Philippine sports is just hoping for the "ambon" coming from the private sector.
The government served as a shadow and the top of the big companies that have personal and his interests that are commercial.
It is not bad to help the private sector.
But the bundle should be the responsibility is in the government.
For now, the government funds are limited to sports.
It is not possible to go away a world klase pasilidad that can be made big in other countries.
Even the turnover of the athletes is also not well so long before seeing potential athletes.
The result of all the ito--the Philippines continues to decrease in the field of sports.
