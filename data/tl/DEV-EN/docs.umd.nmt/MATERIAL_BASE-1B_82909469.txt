Even if it's been touched, it's going to be touched.

Hinipo Si Venicio Riva has a disease neorofibrosis..., a kind of pain cough or the tumor in the skin.
He has been operated in the heart several times, in the eyes and in other parts of the body.
The lump are spread as well as in his face that is why his appearance is scary.

But the more painful for him is that he is built by people that they might be infected with his illness even if it is not contagious.

The doctors said he will only live up to 30anyos.

But nknows!! He is carrying it and he is now 53anyos.
This month he visited Pope Francis.
When the Pope saw him, he approached him and kissed him.
Pope Francis was not grossed out.

He also wasn't afraid that he might get infected with his illness.
Because of this, Venicio felt so happy.
He said: "IT's tulad ng Paradise... it's WAS, it's a minuto, pero para sa akin ay tulad ng pag-aari..." Si Pope Francis became part of the life of Venicio.
But not only to him, Pope Francis becomes part of many people, Christians or with other faith.
In the arrival of Pope Francis many return to the church because they saw the living of faith.
A Christian's mission is not to be rich.
It is not a mission of the following Christ to have the power.
Fame is not also the same.
Kristo's mission is to be a part of other people's lives through doing good.
The mission of a Christian is to help those in need.
The mission of a called by Christ is accepting and love especially to those who are in the hem of society.
