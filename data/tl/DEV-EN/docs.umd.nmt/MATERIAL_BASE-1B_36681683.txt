In the DOTC.

A billion peso was almost lost in the Philippines in the controversial decision of Dept. of Transportation and Communications which was disqualified as a bidder in the autotraffic koleksyon System (AFCS) project for the Metro Rail Transit (MRT) and Light Rail Transit (LRT).
This is the truth: Even the embassy of the country Turkey has a negative reaction because of the controversial "disqualified" in the E-Trans Soadmitting partner of Kentkart company Turkish.
Our fellow citizen from E-Trans Somaiaalis, more than P800M is the height that they will give to the government compared to the offer of the elected bidder which is the connection of the elected bidder which is the basis of the vice-sortium and pumangalawang SM Consortium, which is almost the same and seems to talk to their own "nagpapaalam".
The further lie is the endorsement of the DOTC in the E-Trans Sodoctors because of the alleged thing "technical" so he did not find the ability and how much he offered for the country's funds.
Not so DOTC is included in the "discussion," if there is one?
We cannot blame if Turkish Embassy Commercial counsellor Cezmi Besogul, who wrote DOTC Sec.
Joseph Abaya, as a protest and wishing for the fair treatment of the E-Trans Sopieces of partner of Kentkart respected company in Turkey.
The "nagpapaalam" of the E-Trans Sodoctors should be examined so compared to the "bid" of the elected company and see the public what is more advantage for the government and Filipino people.
This is the truth!
