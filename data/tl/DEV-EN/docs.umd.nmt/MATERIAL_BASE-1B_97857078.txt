It is a problem with the seed By George Nava-True II June 28, what is the symptoms of bone cancer? - Pete is rarely kind of cancer that can start any bones in the body.
Usually affected are the seed of the leg and arm.
Its symptoms are pain and swelling of bones, baling bones, fatigue, and decrease weight.
I have a friend that I want to help.
He has Luga.

What should be done?
Because he is embarrassed to consult.
He needs to go to a ENT specialist because there are many reasons.
Luga or pus coming out of the ears might be caused by infection in the outer, inner ear.
For an example of outer ear infection, it is labas's tainga or otitos, which is coming from bacteria or fungus.
There is so much water in the ears because of swimming, sweat or allergy in the hair spray.
Another reason for Luga is the gitna ear infection from colds, flu or allergy.
It also came from bacteria or virus that comes to the Middle ear.

It is often seen to the children.
It can also come from the puputok or the way you are going to be able to drum.
The eardrum is a huge hole because of the change of the air pressure.

This is common to those riding on the airplane and scduped divers.
The use of cotton buds or anything in the clean ear is also bad for the eardrum.

Go to the doctor to know the reason for it and be given the right medicine.
