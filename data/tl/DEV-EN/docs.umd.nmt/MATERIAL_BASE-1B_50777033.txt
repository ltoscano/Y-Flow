Manila OQT success By @ dbuzzketball July 14, 2016 Tapos is the FIBA OQT and we are sure the impression of the other countries in the Philippines is good because our hosting is good.
We just want to greet MVP and Mr. Al Panlilio because the tournament of the tournament is good.
Al Panlilio can be allowed in his upcoming work as the head of Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas.
We also want to greet the big bosses of MOA Arena as Edgar Tejerero manager of MOA Arena and Arnel Gonzales.
There is a big security risk when you are able to play teams from another country.
But the supervision of MOA especially in the security became good so the FIBA OQT ended well.
We salute you, MVP, Mr. Panlilio, Mr. Tejerero and Mr. Gonzales and all the staff of MOA Arena and Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas.
Congratulations to TV5 because the coverage of the FIBA games will be brought to the entire Philippines.
Tomorrow will open the new conference of PBA.
And in our saw tune games, it looks like a lot of good imports.

Even what we saw Asian imports are also brilliant.
