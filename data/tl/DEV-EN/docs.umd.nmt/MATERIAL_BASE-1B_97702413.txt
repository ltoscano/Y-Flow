Tanikala of the aakalang there is no bars bars.

The balatof living is a hungkag life; the simple and common lifestyle is a peaceful life.
Many don't know and if you know it is not prepared for the trap everywhere around.
They are just surprised why it was stunned by a relationship that was not expected, in the job that was not dreamed of, on the matter involving nothing to do, and in life that were all decepating, in the pretensiyon and these kinds of behavior that would be harmed.

Although often, something is whispering, what is right to do, and how can it be done.

It is hard to lie when it is budhi that humihiyaw.
Especially the pretend of a character that is not you.

Don't try to treat it and be able to reach out to others, you are extraordinary and not a copy.
You will never put out your hidden potential to reach your destination.
You won't be able to do this.
In the reason how big you have received, or even a high position you hold, this is also a sacrifice to give you exchange.
But all of this will be yours if you will use the other side of the same.
Your intentions are the ones who have been blamed and declaring a resuta.
Start and everything is easy to be.

There in love to follow and imitate others, they will always be misled by the path.
