Severe negligence in the Filipino atleta should be faced by PNoy.

If President Benigno "NOYNOY" Aquino III wants the people who are desmayado with him, I think it is a big recall if he will face the chronic problem in the Philippine sports.
We have a lot of good atleta in the country.
But not being monitored again because they were neglected.
Millions of funds of the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) are headed by Richie Garcia, but where goes?
Imagine, we have a kamedalya, but it is kuleland.
The Asian Games will be last?!
It's like the pain in your head there.
The size of funds but it is kuleland?!
Especially in the Philippine Olympics Committee (POC) headed by Unlce Peping.
The size of the fund is there but we also do not have a esa compared to other countries.
In our desire, the administration of PNoy should be allowed to enter the worsening downfall of the manlalaro.
If there is a huge fund allocated there but it is just kuleland it is always, then it will break the opportunity and POC.
O Better pa, replace the two leaders there.
But before replace the Commission on Audit... hala, we should even try to come from Madam Heidi Mendoza, Madam Grace Pulido-Tan... Pakibublame n'yo on his team and POC... T'ensure that Madam Heidi will expect that!
