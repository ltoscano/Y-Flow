Military alert on the 48 anniversary of the NPA.

The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) is on alert after the celebration of the 25th anniversary of New People's Army (NPA) today.
According to AFP Chief of Staff General Eduardo Año, President Rodrigo Duterte still remains the policy to pursue the said rebel group.
It can be recalled that a Lightning rally held himself as members of the NPA in Quezon City as part of their anniversary which caused heavy weight in traffic in the area.
Meanwhile, Año encouraged the leadership of the National Democratic Front (NDF) to control their armed staff as proof that they are sinseror in the peace talks with the government.
The fourth discussion of the government and NDF in April in The Netherlands is set to be rolled over.
