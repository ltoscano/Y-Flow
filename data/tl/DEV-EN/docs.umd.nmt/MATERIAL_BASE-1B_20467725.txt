According to him, I hope, hopefully... By Jimmy Cantor August 13, 2016 a good news was made by Hidilyn Diaz at what welcomed him on Thursday afternoon at the airport in his arrival from Rio de Janeiro.
Everyone thought he was going to finish his joining the international competition after the silver medal was makyes last Sunday.

But he said, he is ready to continue his career and join the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.
But before that, he will enjoy his P5 million reward and a house.
He plans to buy a vacant land beside their house in Zamboanga and will be defeated by a weightlifting center so that the youth in their place will be tested in their place to tested the port that brought him to success.
P5 million is not enough for his plan but surely there are good people who will help to push for what he wants to happen.
I just hope Diaz is not yet tired of what he is doing hard training for him to join Tokyo four years from now.
I can still remember what happened last 1996 when Onyok Velasco has silver medal from Atlanta Olympics.
He was invited to showbiz and because he has intelligence in comedy, he was given a break.
The thing is, Onyok did not return to boxing.
The trend in showbiz is more like that far away from the routine in boxing where he needs to wake up early to jogging and training, where he needs to keep his weight, where he needs to sacrifice everyday.
Afterwards, Onyok forget the boxing and chose a colorful life in showbiz.
It's the lungs, getting tired of boxing.

Alas, because then Onyok is still 21 years old and hopefully ripe ripe if he joined the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
I hope that this is not what happens to Diaz, which will surely be declared Athlete of the Philippine Sportsmanunulat Association.
