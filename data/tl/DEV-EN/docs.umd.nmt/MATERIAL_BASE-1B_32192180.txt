Yesterday, it was like Manny Pacquaio watched the public... Lahand "then focused on hearing in the Senate, even the taxi drivers, were in tune with the radio in the ongoing hearing.
While your servant is watching, we felt pity for Senator Leila De Lima.
I felt sorry because he did circus himself.
Is it a propaganda is what he is after?
Sympathy?
Defend himself?
It is true that he can be cold of sympathy, but what can be done with sympathy when he has filed a case in relation to the accusation that he benefited from money as a protector of illegal drugs?
We even got more abag when we saw the expression of the controlled laughter while he prosecutor Kerwin Espinosa and Ronnie Dayan that their statements in the Legislative Chamber lies.
Then, she cannot look like an eye on lover boy Dayan, she is always looking at Kerwin.
"It is continuously the" making Faces "of Papa love Ronnie.
Don't even think of the smart Senator that he is starting to look like funny?!
It is better that Senator De Lima should just inhibit so that she does not tend to serve his prosecution to Kerwin and Ronnie.
He just wait for him to file a case for his court to defend him and defend himself especially when he says he lies what Kerwin is saying and Ronnie.
"That is if he also has a strong evidence to deny all the accusations against him?!
Sa ngayon, protektahan mo ang sarili mo, Sen. De Lima!
