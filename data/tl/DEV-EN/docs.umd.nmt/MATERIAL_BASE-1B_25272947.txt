Volleyball Gumabao "isn't jealous of Pablo Enero 13, 2017 Kinumsignature of Michelle Gumabao is the separation of the Pocpenis, but he said, because he was jealous of the amping of Myla Pablo.
In the interview of Volmagawan verse.com, Gumabao stated that the reason for his departure on the team was announced to the management.
"It's really IT.
Aalis na si Pocari at sumali sa isa pang team matapos ang kontrata ko noong Disyembre 31, "lahad of Gumabao, which became an instrument in the successful campaign of Lady Warriors in V-League season.
"It's only now that it's started to sink in me that I will leave, that I will change teammates.
It's really sad but I need to, they need it, we need everyone.
"It's IT's gonna para sa lahat ng sigurado", he continues.
His alleged misunderstanding and the management is the reason why he opted to just leave.
But, Gumabao stressed that it is not jealousy to Pablo the reason.
Pablo was given the Pocpenis and a long contract (in the history of the Philippine volleyball) with a brand-bagong kotse as signing bonus.
According to Gumabao, he was happy for Pablo, because he knows that he stayed very hard to achieve the said contract.
But, he said that he said that the said multimillion contract has a wrong message, especially with their teammates who are not even able to sign any other year deal.
"Ibig sabihin, masaya ako para kay Myla, nagsikap siya sa anumang pinirmahan niya.
Mahal ko siya bilang teammate, bilang isang kaibigan at bilang kapatid.
So I won't be able to take a risk if given to him "that's because hindi ko kailangan.
Ibig sabihin, may kotse ako, may bahay ako at isang pamilya na sumusuporta sa akin ", wika ni Gumabao.
"Lahat ng hiniling ko sa WAS ay isang masayang team.
At maybe I am a part of the team that is "that is what hindi na ako masaya".
