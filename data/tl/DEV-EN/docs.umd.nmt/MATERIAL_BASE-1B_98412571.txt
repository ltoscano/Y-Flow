Chacha hearing By Eralyn Prado Enero 19, 2017 Dismayado is Senate President Pro-Tempore Franklin Drilon in not appearing by some ininvited resource Persons in the first hearing of the Senate in relation to the proposed change of the Constitution or known Charter change (ChaCha).
According to Drilon, chairman of the Senate Committee on constitutional amendments, instead of the start of his committee to start a consultation to the provinces, he still needs to call another hearing here in Manila.
This is caused by not appearing by their invited resource Persons.
"MUST ihayag ang aking sama ng loob sa interes ng publiko.
When We HAD and unang hearing namin, We HAD a mahusay na bilang ng invitees, pero and mga sagot na pinagbibidahan E maligamgam, sabi ko MUST.
Gusto ni We na magkaroon ng higit na resource Persons kasalukuyan pero wala namang sumulpot, kaya naman susubukan na naman ni We.
Magkakaroon ng ikalawang pagdinig sa Maynila si We para mag-imbita ng mga nag-aabang sa kanila na hindi kayang Come ", ayon kay Drilon.
