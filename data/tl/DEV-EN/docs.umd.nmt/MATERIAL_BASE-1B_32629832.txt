You will be able to surface By George Nava-True II Disyembre 1, 2016 Lagi I am reading your column on the Abante.
My problem is about my skin.
I experience the itch and devotion on the surface, face and groin.
Because of that, I stayed up with HIV blood test to know if I have AIDS.
After a week, I got the result and non-reactive anyway.
I was asked to go back to the doctor for six months.
Currently, I am working and I am experiencing the mentioned symptoms.
What is the meaning of non-reactive? - Name withheld.
You do not have AIDS because you have to reactive or negative your test.

Your problem is likely dermatitis or swelling of the skin.
This is not contagious and it is not dangerous but it is ugly to look.
Many types of dermatitis like seboric dermatitis and atopdermatitis or eczema.
There are also many reasons but the common symptoms of it is the swelling, redness and itchiness of the skin.
In contact dermatitis, the pantal is from the exposure to those who are airitang things or chemicals.
Neurodermatitis will only be seen in some parts of the body.
In seboric dermatitis, the head and face are affected.
The histura on it seems like a thick temper.
The stasis dermatitis has water under the skin of foot.
The atopic dermatitis or eczema has a makati pantal who are going back and forth.
In the perioral dermatitis, the pantal surrounding the mouth.
I think it's contact dermatitis.
Probably there is one thing around you or you use that you are allergic so the problem is back and forth.
You might be allergic to soap, laba or someone else clean in the house.
Other things that may cause allergy is goma, metals like nickel, jewelries, perfumes, cosmetics, or tonagpapalit antibiotic creams that there is a neomycin the bacitracin.
