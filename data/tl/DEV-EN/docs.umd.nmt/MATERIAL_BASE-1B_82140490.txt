DEP Sko Pacman.

Manny Pacquiao once again proved his skill in boxing when he defeated American boxing sensation Chris Algieri.
In 12 rounds, Algieri is only one-round round that also fell in the lusix times after he was hit by a strong punches of Pacman.
Algieri seemed like a chick who did nothing but dance and ran around the ring to avoid the bigs of the national fist.
Algieri did not make it to sleep, the latest victory of Manny is proof that he can still fight even in the world klase boksingero.
So if Floyd Mayweather is brave, well, he will fight to know who is really in the two of Pacquiao's Greatest boksingero ng lahat ng oras.
Because it's difficult for Mayweaher, it's just all dada.
The truth is, so don't want to fight, it might lay down on the luthat when a mala fist fist hit Pacman.
Pacman is really Hanep.
