Binoe By Betchai Julian SSetyembre 2, 20169 pinalagan of PNP Chief Director General Ronald "Bato" dela Rosa the appeal of the actor Robin Padilla to President Rodrigo Duterte not to name the actors using illegal drugs.
In the statement of Dela Rosa, this does not agree to follow Padilla on the negativity that looks like the government's campaign against illegal drugs is not fair.
The PNP Chief explained that if the request of Padilla followed, the PNP would like to choose if the identity of actors involved in illegal drugs would be hidden.
Dela Rosa insisted that there is an agency of the government who holds the list of actors using and involved in illegal drugs so they deserve to name them.
