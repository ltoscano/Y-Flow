Duterte supported in the garbage By Boyet Jmurang co July 19, 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte is looking for an ally in the Senate on his plan to investigate the pasimpleng tionary pondo of the local government units (LGUs) especially on the matter of garbage.
Sen. Loren Legarda stood firm that the LGUs do not get out of following the law of solid sayang management because aside from they have a huge tionary pondo, the law is also controlling the solid sayang management.
According to Legarda, the Ecological Solid Waste Management (EWSM) Law or the Republic Act 9003) exists.
The law aims to have a clean environment through the use of the system of solid sayang management from the segregasyon of garbage, "segregated transportasyon, processing, pagpapagamot at maayos na pagtatapon ng solid sayang".
The law will also be encouraged to reduce the garbage thrown in sanitary landfill.
Legarda is lonely that the majority of LGUs are not able to follow the provisions of RA 9003, particularly in the decentralisasyon of the sayang koleksyon, pagsumite ng Solid Waste Management (SWM) Plan, paglikha ng local SWM boards, getting up with Materials Recovery pasilidad (NCCA F), closing all of the open sites, and the mandatory sayangin diversion.
In the report of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), by the end of 2015, only in 36 percent of LGUs followed.
