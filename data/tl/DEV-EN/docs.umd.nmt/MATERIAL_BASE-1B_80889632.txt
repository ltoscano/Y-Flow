Good 350 Shooters came from different corners of the world to attend the Australian Army galing and Arms Meeting (aspiring) on the 19th - 17 of May, 2013 at Puckapunyal Military Range, Victoria, Australia.

This is a combat nakatuon husay and braso kompetisyon to show the skills of every soldier of their country using the kasalukuyang-serbisyong maliliit na braso system capabilities, kagamitan at the target try, and training analysis of combat technique, armas training doctrine, and small arms practice.

While 3rd lugar we are in the international teams armas championship kategorya.
There is a oooAhh there!

The said competition and the Shooters came from the United States, Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Indonesia, China and many others.
But this is just a joke on the skill of the lingcharisma of marsing manship where a team or individual will compete in different challenges everyday or night.
There is a assault course that will be shown from the close quarter fighting and sadyang shooting to 450 metro.
Those who are niniper and will test the target over 1000 meters while other kalahok will burst out of different kinds of guns standard issue in their armed strength.

Because of this, it is really good to be Filipinos!
Our soldiers are also like that, world -klase!
