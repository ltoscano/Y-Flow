The tribute to the misery of the tiger lawan and grievance in life is already being stopped.
Avoid the complaints and complaints; ride away from those who are preparing and lack of hope, end the corruption of others and start to live free from the mistakes, failures, and those who are alaled to follow the desire of others.

You can do all the things around you if you can do to change yourself.
