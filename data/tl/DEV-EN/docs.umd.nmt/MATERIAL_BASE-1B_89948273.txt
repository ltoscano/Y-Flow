Heat: Olympians By Al S. Mendoza Disyembre 30, 2016 Ayos is the decision of PSC-POC (Philippine Sports Commission-Philippine Olympic Committee) Task Force.
This is their permission to let go of the 2017 Malaysia SEA Games our 13 athletes participating in 2016 Rio Olympics.
Should be.
They are still the ones who are mixed at all.
Olympic weightlifting silver medalist Hidilyn Diaz will lead the athletes who have no need to pass the SEA Games qualifying tryouts.
The hair Olympian of Diaz are boxer boxer Suarez Suarez and Rogen Lado, hurdler Eric Cris, mahabang jumper Marestella Torres, marathoner Mary Joy Tabal, table tennis star Ian Larothers, broekwn, Juniter, Nestor Colstie Elaine Alora, lifter Nestor Colonia, judoka Kodo. Si Jessie Khing Lacuna and Jasmine Alkhaldi and Jasmine Alkhaldi.
The main attack attacks in any Olympics means that you are really high-caliber athletes.
The Olympic Games will not be compared to the Asian Games.
The SEA Games is still so?
For those who have been able to escape from the Olympics, it seems that the SEA Games is just a chick of them.
Like, the SEA Games is just like a barangay tournament for the ex-Olympians.
And because of the difficulties to enter the Olympic marapat, their free ticket will also be rewarded in Olympians going to the SEA Games.

I hope they will win Malaysia?
Happy New Year!
