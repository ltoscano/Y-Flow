VP Leni reacted to Land conversion ban By Bernard Taguinod Oktubre 15, 2016, Vice President Leni Robredo cared for the plan of the Executive Department to implement ban on the Land conversion within two years because it was supposedly a big effect on the government's efforts to give home people who have no own house and land.
In the petition that Robredo signed, chairperson of Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC), he asked to consider the publishing of "kumot" Executive Order (EO) that will stop the Land conversion in two years.
Aside from HUDCC, the Department of Finance (DOF) is also included in the petitioner, Department of Budget (DBM) and the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA).
The militant groups first suggested in the legislative chamber to ban on Land conversion to ensure that the Land Land is not convert in the Industrial.
Nevertheless, because "the EO is" kumot, "Robredo is worried that even the land plans of housing ayuan will be affected so it is bothered to delay the housing project of the government.
"And panukalang kumot dalawang taong ban sa Land paggamit ng conversion ay magpapakilala pa rin ng dagdag na pagkaantala sa pabahay at magsettlement ng proseso, si Which naman ang magbibigay sa insurmountable housing backlog na nagtatrabaho para tugunan", ayon kay Robredo.
The housing from Yolanda-affected area is mainly affected by this because these places in Eastern Visayas region are all inside the agrikultura zones.
