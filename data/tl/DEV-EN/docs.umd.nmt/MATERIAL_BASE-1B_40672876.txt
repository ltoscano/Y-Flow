Change Scamming: Where Na Ang Pagchange will change.

David D'Angelo KAHIHIYAN - kahihiyan, opinion -

Senator Leila De Lima has been on the lookout, and has been removed from their positions in the Senate the LP senators.
Vice President Leni Robredo has not been in his position in his position and Marcos is buried in the Libingan ng mga Bayani.
Despite this, traffic in EDSA continues, the delay in the MRT, the suspension tualization and mass retrenment, the war in Mindanao, decrease the value of the peso and many others.
Is it a change Coming or change Scamming?

When will the change that will change?

In six months when criminality etc. etc. is not lost, President Rodrigo "Digong" Duterte will resign from his position.
More than six months have passed and it seems that there is no clear change that happened in our country.
Anyway, more than 7,000 have died, they are not addicted, tulak, pusher and others.
Almost one million surrendered and said to stop illegal drugs - a big change.
This is First time in the history of our country so I salute this event.

But the other things are already gone or even if it is kept glancing that there will be a change that will happen.
Traffic in EDSA got worse, the train in MRT... hmmm, anyway, is the problem of the former administration but did not say that it will change?

Prohibited to complain?

Is it forbidden to complain or not agree with the president?
President Duterte is good and strong and I admire his abilities but should block those who oppose or do not want to agree with what he wants?
It is scary that the senators of the Liberal Party suddenly removed their duty after they do not support the death penalty bill (read the news from Rappler).
Then a woman like Senator Leila de Lima is on jail now, there are evidence and will be charged.

What is happening in our country?
Is there a change or change nagtakbuhan this really?
What is your view here?
