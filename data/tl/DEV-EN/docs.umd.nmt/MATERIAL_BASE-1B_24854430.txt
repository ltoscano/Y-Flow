With By George Nava-True II Enero 4, 2017 day, my dirt is accompanied with blood.
I dumudumi three times a day.
But I do not feel pain except for the labo of my vision.

I don't know what to do and I'm afraid that it might be cancer - Edison.
It is scary to look at the dirt with blood but it is usually not dangerous.
This means that the digestive tract is a problem.

Go to the doctor to know the cause of this.
If the blood is dark, it may come from ulcer or other problems in the Upper digestive tract.
If its color is brighter red or there, it is a symptom of a problem with the lower digestive tract.
Often hemorrhoids or almoranas is the cause of this.
The other reason for blood in the dirt is divertious disease.
The divertient is small pouches that are often cough in the malalaking bituka.
When it gets lost, the call here is diverticulitis and it may be with blood poo.
This can also happen when there is an anal fissure or rip in tissue of anus like what is happening when there is a chapped to a person.
Its reason is hard and big dirt.
If there is a booktic ulcer or wound in the stomach or small bituka, the dirt is also with blood.
This is usually from bacterial infection or for a long time using aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen.
Cancer is also a posibilidad that it came from the polyps or cbukol ng cells in the colon.
Another sanhi is varicose veins in the esophagus - the profit of the throat in the stomach.
To be sure what the reason for blood is to check up to the doctor so that you don't get nervous and sleep well.
