It is still the most important thing to different kinds of ability

Recently, the right part of the rescue Dbite was reported to be a big part of a rescue and dagat for the ship that was a tourist, MV Azamara quest.
According to the report, the said ship had a fire in his makina room in Dagat Sulu.
And with the help of the combined forces of the Navy and Coast Guard, the ship was immediately given help.
Particularly here is the release of the security assistance to an escort on the ship from three ships of the Navy while the crew members of the ship were repaired by his broken machine which gave way to finally and orderly journey to Malaysia.
After two days, the Navy once again gave help to another vehicle that this time was a yacht that was destroyed and there were already foreign tourists near Negros Oriental.
No one was reported hurt in this incident and the Navy was successful saved by the Navy.
It can be recalled that in the past months, the Navy became instruments in the sakuna response operations after the earthquake in Negros and Cebu and before it was in the storm in Iligan and Cagayan de Oro.
It is obvious, my comrades, that with all these incidents and in response of the Navy, there is a ability to respond to different kinds of disaster in the ocean and baybaying sea.
But in front of all of this, the Navy will not neglect the guards in our wide ocean against the evil things that have been made in nature, peace and integrity of our territory in the ocean.
In front of different times in need of presence and response to the ocean, it can be seen that the part of the Navy is huge, including the other agencies of the government in the care of our ocean.
Here in this role will be seen the importance of a Hukbong Dbite to perform his important role in the time of silence and the calamity.
However, it can't be done properly and thoroughly all of them if our countrymen still don't have any support.
So with your help all the Navy is capable of all this!
