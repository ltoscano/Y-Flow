A new PDEA agents, SANA HUWAG to divert their right path.

It was said that it was past the neuro-psychological, medical examinations, agility test, background imbestigasyon and the panel interview the 67 new agents of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency.
PDEA introduced the new agents from the "faith" Class, the 6th batch of Drug Enforcement makahingi ers who are training 6 months in PDEA Academy in Silang, Cavite.
On the 6th pagsisimula ehersisyo para sa Drug Enforcement Macario ers Basic Course in PDEA Gymnasium, PDEA Director General Undersecretary Arturo Cacdac, Jr. was very happy to be introduced by PDEA Director General Undersecretary Arturo Cacdac, Jr. of 67.
Some of these are sensible and some of them will be limited to the way towards harm?
It is not without us to temptation drugs and it is plague to society, that is why many sensible and respected individuals are involved in drugs.
Can PDEA not be a problem with some of this that Cacdac is proud of?
The Lord's Lily prayed that there would be no small path in the new agents. o0or MINSAN I spoke to a few tricycle drivers of different TODA in Quezon City and they said that there are many of the drivers who are "addicted" on drugs.
We believe what we have talked to, especially the night shift.
Why do the TODA prevail ers do not do anything if they know that their members are using drugs?
Why do they have to play blind in this habit of drivers?
Will they wait for an accident or an accident?
It would have been okay if they were going to hurt.
What if even if they had no idea that passenger would be involved, especially the children?
Hopefully, to the operators of the tricycle, before they accept their driver, they should find out if they are involved in drugs or they find out if they use them.
