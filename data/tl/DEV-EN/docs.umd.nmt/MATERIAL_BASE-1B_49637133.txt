Beware of money!
This is the one who can tell the last IG posts of Heart Evangelista where he seems to have a fashion pictorial in Paris, the said fashion Capital of the World.
Eh, what is going to be his former based on the pictures "that is his drama is," If a picture paints a libong salita, then, bakit Cdi ko pintura? "
Or, that is why, "The mukha na maglunsad ng isang libong barko".
It is palhing!
It is just so proud that it is really in the middle of the foreign pinaganda es, the Filipina beauty of Heart will not be denied in the mixture of different races.
Well, yeah, it was said that Heart's mamahaling pamumuhay was even there not only to have a eklat in Paris but to take care of the rumored meeting with a manufacturer that has something to do with the Hermes produkto.
Well, if everything will push through, aside from those who are envious "he piktyurs," we will see his paintings placed in one of the most love and the product of the whole world is really good.
It is said that this is just a limited edition if he does not want to let the opportunity pass because aside from showbiz where he is also busy, it is one of those who are taking out his time for now.
It is not just that he is simply an artist, but he is a follower of art.
Artist, like that.
So while he has not yet started any project as a Viva talent, he will be able to concentrate on it now.
How totoo that despite being Mrs. Heart Escudero is still a lot of afam the one who is forced to look back at him while the camera is able to click and while he pose to pose?
