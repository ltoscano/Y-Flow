San Jose, Occidental Mindoro, August 22 (PIA) - two days Regional blood Services Meeting of the Department of Health (DOH) Mimaropa in Sikatfirst Beach Hotel, San Jose.

It is the purpose of the said meeting to discuss the issues regarding the operation of the blood service facilities of every province like the lack of blood, ways to invite people who will give blood (doo) and seseteachers with enough supply in the region.

According to Ramonthis Martin, the Health Emergency Management and the blood Services Unit will be one of the blood Services Unit, these facilities (blood service pasilidad) are being taken under the blood service network.

Started in 2009, it is the purpose of the blood service network that members of its members will go further through.
"There was someone who came up with the oursourcing of the networking" explanation of Martin.
It means that it might give or ask for blood to a facility in another network of this.

On the level of the region, the city of Batangas and Lucena while inside the rehiyong Mimaropa are going to have a network for five provinces.
"The provinces of Marinduque were able to replace blood, Romblon, Oriental and Occidental Mindoro" Martin added.
Palawan was not included because of its distance in other provinces.

Currently global target for the collection of blood is two percent of the whole population of a place.
But in the Mimaropa, it is only stored by .7 percent of blood.

"But we still can't say that we have the lack of blood because we give the needs of our countrymen" according to Martin.
He also said that it is better if we can equal the global target (2 percent) as preparation for any big disaster or war.

This can only be done if many will respond to some activities like the mass bloodletting of the Philippine National Red Cross.
