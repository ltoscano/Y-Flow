I have a goose what I felt when I read a small photo caption about Energy Secretary Al Cusi.
Secretary Cusi was given to the painting (kolektor's item) which is a gift to him of the political gang Japanese aritist Keisuke Teshina, who is known to his One-stroke Dragon technique, for the project Duterte's kitchen magpakain program.
But instead of cash to give the bidder, they promised to be alob of porridge, using and other necessities for the Duterte's Duterte.
Goose umbok, because, we are now able to make it happen to the opisyal officials.
Most of the people we know they are being taken care of by a president in the position, the first thoughts on how to take a piece of "his own funds" will enter their pocket.
Secretary Cusi, the contribution of his contribution to the Duterte's kitchen magpakain program.
After all, he can only hope that he will give his donation.
Surely, the nagsusuplay and bidders in the projects of the Department of Energy (DOE) will still be expensive for this kind of project, just get closer to the match of the President.
But Secretary Al did not do that, instead he was given to a priceless possession.
A good example for the other government official.
I hope all the government officials have this kind of thinking.
If they are like that, the former high texting citizens will return to the government.
Panatilihin ang magandang trabaho Secretary Al "Pon-sing" Cusi, kudos!
