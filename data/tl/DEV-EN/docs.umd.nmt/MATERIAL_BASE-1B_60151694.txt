Almost 3 By George Nava-True II August 26, 2016 this is the last part of my answer to John L. Negros Occidental, a 38-year-old marino who has alopes a areata where the hair fell.
Yesterday I discussed what was aloged and the cause of it.
Now, let's talk about how to be treated.
I am saddened to say that there is no cure in alocing a areata but can lessen its worsening and the lost hair might be cough.
Usually the hair will tutubo again after a year so the other is just being neglected.
To improve face, can wear a wig which is made in real hair or synppy buhok.
It may be abit in the anit through glue, clips or tape.
Do not conduct a buhok weaving (weave hair in the appointed hair in the annito) because you will take care of it especially.
Also beware of the use of perms or doo because it may be mangalbo as long as possible.
The common medicine in the alosers is to be the one who is connected to the anticosteroids.
It is doing this every 4 or 6 weeks.
It will also help the child or old people who are detained corticosteroids which is being painted in the annito.
Because the anyou are red and you have something to make sure that you might be able to contact the derma of the derma of you.
It causes allergic reaction after putting the medicine in the anonce a week.
This is irritating and the anumula is going to be irritated and it seems that there is a bit of an excuse but it helps to cough the hair again for 3 months.
Some of the side effects of this are severe redness of the anness and swelling of the kulani on the neck.
Another medicine is a psoralen with a ultraviolet A light (PUVA) therapy.
It is used when a large part of the body is affected by alooes and can't use other medicine.
Consult a good dermatologist to help.
The derma is really expensive but you will find a cheap and good service to the government hospitals.

Some of the private hospitals can also be able to go through a few private hospitals that can go to.
