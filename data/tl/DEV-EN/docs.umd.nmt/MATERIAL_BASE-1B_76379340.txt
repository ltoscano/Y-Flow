Port only!: POC election will push through?
By Zaldy Perez Nobyembre 15, 2016 Habang approaching the POC elections in November 25, nervous or doubts if it will push through.
In this dates, the Senate committee hearing is set by the leadership of fighting Senator Manny Pacquiao "in aid of the legislation" in the alleged unliquidated pondo given to POC of PSC which costs 126.6 million from 2010 until this year.
Senator Pacquiao also heard about the bisa of the filed resolution of Senator Sonny Angara the one who was disqualified by ABAP President Ricky Vargas to run for Peping Cojuangco in the 2016 of POC.
Cojuangco desires for his fourth term.
It is telling the resolution of Angara that the two issue is important to clarity because it is affected by the development of the Philippine sports which is the source of our "national pride, inspiration and instrument in the Nation-building."
In the opinion of Vargas's camp and the majority of the wisdom did not have any reason to disqualify the ABAP president of POC election committee which is obviously able to be iling or side of the incumbent president.
Justice by POC Comelec, Vargas failed to meet the "aktibong membership" in General Assembly meetings provision under POC By-laws.
One of the pinakaka-anticipate is to put out the TRO (Temporary restraining Order) at the right time, timing for the day of the election.
According to the lawyer of Vargas, they need the TRO to determina who is right or wrong.
It is also good to anticipate if this measure of the camp of Vargas will lead to the sanction of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) like what happened to the Indian Olympic Association before because of the chaotic process of the election.
