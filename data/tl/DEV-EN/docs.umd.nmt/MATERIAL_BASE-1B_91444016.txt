Admirable admirable.

Are you okay?
Korina Sanchez (Filipino Star Ngayon) It's been recalled updated June 19, 2014 - 12: 00am, 12: 00am.

The Japanese captured the Japanese who are being picked up by their scattered after their game against Ivory Coast in the World Cup, where they lose, 2-1.
It's defeated, it's cleaned.
Praises rushed to what they did.
It showed the world to say concern, and discipline.
A lot of impressed with them.
I can be sure that there is no other country to do that, except if ever imitate from now.
Japanese are known in discipline, order and following the authority.
When the earthquake and tsunami in Japan hit, those who survived lined up while waiting for help from the government.
Compare that to what happened in Leyte and Samar, a few hours after the devastation of typhoon Yolanda.
Too far.
We have a lot to learn from Japanese.
But someone was able to comment bad about what the Japanese did.
"It is said to be wierdo."
Probably not used to seeing the cleaning of their place this year.
It used to be scattered and just leave up to those who are scheduled to clean up.
In short words, they don't problem the scattered so don't care.
If this person is like this, I can't do anything, but just don't speak badly with those who make it well.
Our culture needs this kind of discipline.
On the road, they will see the throwing everywhere.
Those who are pos cigarettes, wrapped candy, botelya of mineral tubig and too much food.
They don't problem the garbage, so it's just a waste anywhere.
In religious gatherings, it is a mountain-mountain of garbage where it will be thrown away.
And when it flooded in the napakakonting rain, the government will be blamed.
If only half of the whole population of the Philippines has customs like the Japanese, we probably progress.
