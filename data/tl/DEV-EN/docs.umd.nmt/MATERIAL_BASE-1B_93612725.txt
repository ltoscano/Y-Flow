Witnesses: There are non-stop downpour By Jimmy Cantor SSetyembre 10, 2016 is really lucky that Hidilyn Diaz, our weightlifter who won the silver medal in the previous Rio Olympics.
Diaz was included in the athletes from Southeast Asia who was honored by AirAsia last Thursday in Bangkok, Thailand.
What he received the prize?
No, it is only five years riding free in the airplane of AirAsia going to places where the said budget carrier has a trip.
The prize of the gold medal?
It's just not there, while it's a life of riding in AirAsia.
For those who won the bronze medal, three years of free riding.
Onyok Velasco has also received a lot of prize, our boxer who also won the silver medal in 1996 Atlanta Olympics, but it is far more received by Diaz.
Aside from cash, with P5 million reward from the government, he was also given a bahand and lot.
Diaz was very happy of course.
He said, he first went to places in the Philippines like Davao because the Samal Island was there, the Coron in Palawan and Cebu.
"I also have to catch up with it," he said to a heartbeat.
Aside from free riding on the airplane of AirAsia, Diaz would also steal the support from the Philippines AirAsia for his training in 2020 Tokyo Olympics where he is expected to be one of those who will be favorites in gold medal.
It is not yet clear what Diaz will get from the company but it will surely be about his future training.
Albert Atilano Jr., the vice president of the Philippine Weightlifting Association, their program for Diaz is to be declared champion in the SEA Games in the 2017 Southeast Asian Games in Malaysia, 2018 Asian Games and 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
If he can't get the gold in Malaysia, he needs to get the gold on 2019 SEA Games that will be done in the Philippines.

Whew!
We are expecting everything from Diaz.
I hope, this isn't malula.
