25, Christmas Day, is going to pour out the balikbayan boxes brought or sent by OFWs in the Philippines for their own loved ones.
Because of Christmas, the tax exemption of balikbayan boxes will start the contents costs P150,000 per OFW or balikbayan.
If you noticed we did not say P150,000 per box but per OFW or balikbayan because P150,000 is kabuuang halaga of tax exemption per delivery or per home.
P150K total So, there might be a thought of that to send three boxes that the halaga of each box is P150,000 or kabuuang P450,000 for three boxes.
That's not like that, "okay?
Anyway, it is a very big favor that the administration has given the tax exemption to P150,000 because before only 10,000 pesos is the halaga of the balikbayan boxes that are not being paid by taxes.
JUST, in every year, the OFW or balikbayan of P150,000 balikbayan box tax exemption for three times.
Thbigas So, sa isang taon, in three municipalities ment of the pribilehiyo that it can be P450,000 pesos worth the goods that can be tax exempt.
The pribilehiyo is not absolute because there is a kondisyon that they will impose so that the tax exemption will not be used in smuggling of dutiable goods.
The conditions should only be personal epekto of the balikbayan boxes or "the item that used to be (ukay) or if before it is personal stuff of sent or sent.
Non-commercial can't be commercial the quantity of the will be sent.
Halimbawa, the Customs will tax "that if the contents of your box is P150,000 worth of perfumes or P150,000 worth of alcohol.
Para maging ligtas, you will only be swayed by pinakamabigat dalawang items per kategorya.
Halimbawa, two bottles of perfumes and two bottles of alcohol.
Mas maraming biyaya Truly, Christmas of OFWs and balikbayan are good because of tax exemption of balikbayan boxes, disappearance of planting-bullet extort scam in NAIA and the better operation of our airports.
