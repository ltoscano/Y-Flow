An attempt to break the 31st IB, disappointed by the BHB.

It is used that the Pulang warriors of the Bagong Hukbong Bayan were defeated and defeated in an attempt to break them with the military troops in Barangay Marinas, Sorsogon City last dawn in November 7, 2012.
The seven (7) gerilya against the troops of the 31st IB Philippine Army and safely backed out from the fight.

In order to cover up the failure of the said strike operation, implying by the 31st IB that there were those who were wounded in the gerilya of the BHB.
The truth is, Raffy Gitomo was the one who hit the nonstop firing of the soldiers.

The soldiers will always be the basis of the soldiers when they fail in their operations.
In the tinaguriang pursuit operation of the 31st IB after the fight, some of the barangays nearby at the scene of the scene and they were able to shocking the taumbarrio.
Last November 9, the soldiers forcibly entered the house of Gng.
Cynthia Enconado in Barangay Sangat, Gubat, Sorsogon and threatened his son.

We challenge the ander of the 31st IB Lieutenant Col. Teody Toribio that his personnel are mandting their fight and not the civilians who are helpless.
You will crawl in the civilian, you are coward with the real fight.
