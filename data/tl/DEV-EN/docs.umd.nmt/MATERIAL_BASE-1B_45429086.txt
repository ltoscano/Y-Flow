Bagay has a lesson.

If they are alive, do not follow the flow, instead, follow the puseline.

Every thing in life has a lesson that you are destined to pay for.
They are being sent to you to wake up your hidden potential to know completely yourself.
You are here in this world to become bong towards the most statue despite your own.
You don't know!! Pasan the challenge or trials coming in your life when you don't have to be able to attend any lessons in life.
Watch your experiences as well as lessons that you need to voluntarily come out your true personality.

The things that are happening to you seem to be the schools of the stairs that you need to climb to reach the success that you seek.
Sakalfive you will not be able to attend the moment that you are leading, you will return again to the former baitang so that the next time will be distributed again.
Many are wondering why they can't leave their situation.
Because they do not realize that they need to be able to attend their current situation first (baitang).

Be calm and patient when you feel like things are not right and suffer, and there is really no hope to rise from life.

Accept that this is not yet the right time, and there is still a need for a lot of training and burning eyebrows to determine the fulfilment of your dreams.
This is a joke: It is in person's action, and the pity is in the Dityos.

The fares in every matter of what is happening to you is in you, you can treat it destruction to stop and lose hope, or treat it as an opportunity and as a challenge to your abilities so that your desire to succeed.
Choose: Win or talunan.
Grief or happiness?

The fares that will not be able to walk away is a body without a head.
