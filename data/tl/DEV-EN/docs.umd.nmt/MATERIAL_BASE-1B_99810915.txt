It appears that the pangil of the CPDT of the 31st IB in the Bayan of Bulusan.

Samuel Guererro Celso Maware Command - BHB-Sorsogon November 13, 2012, 2012, 2012.

We received complaints about those who abuse and other desirable activities of the troops of the 31st IB Philippine Army connection to the development operations in the barangay of San Bernardo and San Roque in Bulusan, Sorsogon.

The following are some of the respects made by the soldiers:

It is a secret abuse of women who are doing exactly inside the barangay hall using the soldiers station.

The taumbarrio, especially to the youth, in vices like drinking and gambling.
Threats of the accused supporters of the revolutionary movement.
Today, the civilians were forced to leave Romulo Galindes from Brgy.
San Bernardo is because of what Corporal Tañada is forcing him to make a post of Bagong Hukbong Bayan.
Corporal Tañada is the leader of the "community kapayapaan at the development team" (CPDT) of the 31st IB in the barrio.

The mapanlinlang CPDT is not yet long for the barangay of Bulusan, it shows that their pangil and real colors are appearing.
The abuse will worsen if they will vote if it is not immediately free to leave the affected areas.
