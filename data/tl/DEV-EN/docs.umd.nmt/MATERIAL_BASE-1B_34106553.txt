In his speech in front of the Philippine Medical Association (PMA) "Kapihan in Manila Hotel Media Forum," Doctor Tayag also said that there is not a question if there is one or where you can find it but you should not have it and use it in any way.
"To those who believe, that the caninis may be used to be used in a treatment in any kind of diseases, they should remember that it is illegal and should not be used without permission from DDB (Dangerous Drugs Board)," the health official.
The Philippine Moms have explained and Medical Marijuana (PMMM) founder Kathleen Kim that their advocacy in supporting the use of marijuana for his panggagamot, is not right to make the canitation of the few patients in order to ease their suffering from their condition. It is because of the pain epilepsy.
"The time is meaningful because there is a increase in number of patients who have medical problems that can be treated and enaling marijuana," Kim confessed.
