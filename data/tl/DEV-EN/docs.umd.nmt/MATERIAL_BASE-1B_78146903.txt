Alcohol and cigarettes pah!

A lot of us remember while the senators insisted, congressmen, congressmen and from the palace about alcohol and coward.
Every summer, when you travel the haywey from La Union up to Ilocos Norte, it is almost constant talks that you will see crops of farmers.
The talks of rice is being found in the rainy season.
You will also be able to show those who are going to Cagayan and Isabela.
And in Cordillera, there are also a lot of planting talks.
I am really a big source of living.

If it is the rainy season of talks and rice, it is obvious how higher the boxes of serbein on the side of the farmers' houses.
There are also many scattered bottles of mahabang nek, width and others.
There are also many scattered pack.
In the sari-sari store, the sitsirya, shampu and soap have a lot of cigarettes and alcohol goods.
This is even if someone dies and nagpapatayan because of alcohol and coward.
Even if someone dies from the disease from alcohol and cigarettes.

We even noticed something, Suki.
There are lots of talks and alcohol with no taxes.
The netib talks that are planted and being harvested is no tax.
Ah, the lambanog, coconut wine and Basi, normally there is no taxes.
Just then buy the tagabarangay of the deed of factories alcohol and sigarlyo if there is an occasion like berdey and festa. oOo Habang there is a war in Congress and palace, just laugh at those who are asking for the netib talks.
Just laugh at the lumalzzle of the lambanog, tuba, Basi and tapned alcohol from rice.
Life is mysterious in alcohol and coward.
Most of all, the chase will fight here, especially those who depend on pork barrel from taxes in vices.
