The third regret.

I hope I managed to be brave express my feelings.

Most people regret why they lost their strength to reach their feelings.
Many of them, just to do not have to be angry, being forced to hide their attention, just settle to hide it and keep it.
More than they are in favor of a mistake than hair and fight for their principles.
They argued, "we just follow the flow, so that we don't get involved."
"It's what tune, it's not, it's also that dancing!"
But in all of this, they are paralyzed by their conscience why they are washed by the flow and even become an accomplice of the evil of others.

Always plead, they are blaming, complaining and escaping to avoid.
Why is the gobierno being blamed when he sold the votes?
Why are complaining about the pile of garbage when there is no habas to throw anywhere?
Someone wants to do something but don't want to get involved?
Wants to change but can't start yourself exactly?
Like what is expected, they just accepted the usual inanticipated situation instead of express their real feelings.

As a result, they had a serious illness that has a relationship with the worries, it's been speculated, and it's rape that they won't be able to take it away.

Paala: Even at work, in a relationship, or even a partner in business, we often decide to bite our tongue more than direct express what is bothering our minds.
We quickly escape the situation to not be involved.
We have to be able to stand our real personality instead of those who agree with what we do not want.
Instead of being suffering, waiting for the good opportunity, let us not let the moment pass our love, compassion, and help because it is needed in good pagtuturingan.
Do not take pictures and fear that we will be in trouble.
We have to learn to be awake with our emotions and express it when it is appropriate for more to help happy together.

What is right, hide in and hide the feelings, or express it when it is at ease any lumiligalig in mind?
