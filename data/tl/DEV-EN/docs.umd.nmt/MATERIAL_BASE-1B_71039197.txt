Force force to be able to do it.

Honestly, we don't need a lot of money to be happy.
The only often conflict is if there is no money and a lot of think that it is a problem but if we would want to be happy, there is a way, especially this Christmas.
This is the principle that is being used by the local government unit of QC.
Despite the extensive call not to hold Christmas party, Mayor Bistek Bautista and Vice Mayor Joy Belmonte are forcing the spirit of Christmas for residents to be gone.
You have seen the light lights in the city hall and in QC Circle, the heart will rise and make it happy.
Is there a lot of money spent here?
My news is contributing to the residents who have the ability.
I also did not lose the story of mayor.
Yes and there is no party, but it does not mean that the residents will not be able to make fun of the day of Christmas.
The QC also understands the condition of our countrymen in areas affected by typhoon Yolanda and earthquake.
They have lost all the properties and lost, how will they make you happy now?
But, one is the local government of QC in the first sympathize with those who are affected.
Mayor Bistek was given and VM Belmonte of the help of P50 million to the victims.
Hopefully the contribution that the people from Quezon City will reach and can make you happy.
This is not the first sympathy of QC to the Filipinos who are victims of calamities.
Even then, saanman, there is a need, first in line, QC in the towns who are ready to contribute help.
The happy community is important to QC, and this is what pushed Mayor Bistek is Vice Mayor Joy to force the "sprout of Christmas holiday" in the whole city.
We can do it, if it would.
We will be able to help those who are lonely if we just cannot grasp but will include in our enjoyment.
A little bit of things, good lights, a little contribution to the poor countrymen, fine.
What's important, the government works hard to make us happy.
