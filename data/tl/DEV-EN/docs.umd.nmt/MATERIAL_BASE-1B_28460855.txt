To change.

Posted By: Nelson forte Flores on April 25, 2016.

Many react in my last column that I have said that Senator Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos and straighten out the mistakes of his parents during martial law.
Some of our readers said that I have written the column because I did not experience the domination of Marcos dictatorship.
The one who should have admitted Bongbong was admitted to his family's sin and asked for forgiveness from the people.
I was sad about this kind of criticism because it was clear for me that this is a kind of closing mind.
First, the big part of the filipino people experienced domination during the time of the dictatorship and we are included in this part.
But I will not close my mind to get to know a leader with potential to change our society no matter who he is.
It is a matter of the progress of the nation and not my personal feelings or experience.
The father or mother should not be able to drag the child's fault.
I have a feeling that a hypocrite is the only one who will say that they will get rid of their parents because of the mistakes that have been done.
One more thing, I believe that Bongbong could have learned from the mistake that his parents had done.
It is possible that a creature like Bongbong is going to change towards goodness although I also cannot dismiss that he may not have learned.
Still, as a Christian I will risk the belief that he changed towards the good.
Again, I repeat... that the parents of the parents should not end up with the child because if there are no one who has the right to handle the renda of power.
All of us are also victims of the mistakes of our parents or their own parents.
What do you think?
