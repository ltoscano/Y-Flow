To go through with sports.

These past few days, the feelings of the Filipinos overflow about basketball.
A lot of went here in the Philippines international basketball superbituin and that they are to impress all of the kalinga of the Pinoy fans in basketball.
Even the fight of UST and La Salle became emotional and all almost watched.
The Filipinos are really sportsminded.
That is why my belief is better to have a great deal to have called sports turismo.
I am even a councilor, I am going to head the Sports Tourism in QC.
I pushed the event like QC vs. and World Billiard tournament and the QC chess Road show where in the tourist spot in QC did the fights.
It is not just a basketball that can be the energy of tourism in the Philippines.
Boxing is the leading, the amount of superbituin in this field.
Bowling, the billiards that we have a lot of famous.
We can also be spearulo of water sports and we show the beauty of the beach in the country.
There are many places in the Philippines beautiful destination and perhaps the famous sportsman we have to show up, identify and help for the improvement of tourism in the country.
The potential of tourism in the Philippines is huge especially if the famous athletes who are promoters are going to be used and especially because the story of our athletes' lives are beautiful and truly can be an inspiration to anyone.
I hope that the government take advantage of the fame of some of our sports people to attract a lot of interest and lots of attention to the Philippines.
If Pacman won't be made by his endorsement of a senator in America, just think about what he can do to help the country if he will talk, and athletes like him, in the whole world about the beauty of our beloved country, and encourage the other race to include our country in their plans to go to our country.
