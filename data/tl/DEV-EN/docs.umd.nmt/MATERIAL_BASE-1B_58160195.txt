Our sincere pakikiramay sa Quezon City Mayor Herbert Bautista, and his siblings Harlene and Hero.
It hurts but it's a buhay MUST.
Their beloved father died, Herminio "Butch" Baustista noong Martes Morning.
Butch is also an actor and went out to the movies where late Fernando Poe Jr.
Their group in showbiz mundo is marked, the Lor "Waist Gang who almost woke up in the box office of the cinema that was thrown out before.
During panahong iyon, the maramihang teatro will not be popular that will be able to come out of the local films.
Aside from FPJ and Butch, Boy Santa is also a member of the Lor "Waist Gang.
Romana, Boy Francisco, Zaldy Zhornack, Bobby Gonzalez, Mario Antonio, Berting Labra, and Tony Cruz, who is one of the most great dancer noong kanilang panahon.
The leading lady is that if our sign is right, Corazon Rivas, that Pablo Santiago is the one who will be able to attend.
In the mentioned Lor Waist Gang, they seem to be able to breathe in the presence of God God.
It is sad but part of life is death, so it is ETERNAL rest pagbigyan nila lalo sir Butch.
At hayaan na si Perpetual light shine sa kanila.
There is a kanilang mga kaluluwa magpahinga sa kapayapaan!
Amen.
