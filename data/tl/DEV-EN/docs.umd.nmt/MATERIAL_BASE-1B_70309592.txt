For two weeks.

Land Transportation Franchising at Regulatory Board Chairman, Atty.
Winstons Ginez, because of the severe traffic these past few days that were paralyzed in Metro Manila.
The LTFRB received various criticisms.
Even if it should be a partner of this agency, it is very heard against LTFRB.
Chairman Ginez is not tired of answering the various blaming him.
It is hard to be forced to listen to the explanation of the critics, especially in the situation where the LTFRB is located, which is severe traffic and many straight affected.
But also force us to listen to the plan of the LTFRB and the answer of Chairman Ginez in criticizing him.
In fixing the problem of traffic, it's not just one side to listen to.
In the case of the same time applying for the permit for the cargo truck, it needs to grant all the stakeholders to give an provisionary permit the truck while they are waiting for their permit from LTFRB.
It is not allowed to stop the travel of the trucks that bring all the business of the country.
The economy will be affected if we insist on the immediate implementation so Ginez is asking for time.
The deadline of the application is in August.
29 and after this, there was no extension.
The law will be strictly implemented - will be arrested and be penalized when illegal colorum and out of line are heavy.
The Chairman is asking for consideration for the extension until August 29 so that the move of business will not stop and not be the reason for the fall of the economy of the country.
Ginez's position is not easy.
More than twenty-nine thousand of the trucks are not a joke that needs to apply permit for legal to be able to travel.
It has been a few years of problems to manage the trucks on our roads, what is the additional two weeks.
Some of the komenters said it is speed up.
The answer of Chairman - "we look for the right solution because the sake of the LTFRB is given the interest of all.
Let's bol / Atty.
Ariel Enrile.
