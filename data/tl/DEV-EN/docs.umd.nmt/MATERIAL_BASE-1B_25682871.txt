Be careful with cancer treatment scam.

A tweet.

A tip is what I received from a trusted source regarding a sidelines that is being done by a new syndicate moving here in the country.
This syndicate is composed of some corrupt individuals from China who introducing themselves as an expert in medications and healing people who are sick of cancer.
And because of this in the Philippines, they automatically matik with an accomplice of course they are Filipinos who are supposed to be able to attend doctors.
The sidelines of the syndicate led to the big hospitals where there are rich patients who are sick of cancer.
If they found a target victim, they will talk to him and with the help of their contact Filipinos who often travel to China, they will introduce the experiment or cancer treatment specialist from the said country.
And because of the skill of the sales usap of these fools who are using the award of some former patient who recovered, they are sure they convince the desperate patients to be treated in their country.
What's worse here is to spend millions of patients but when they return, they will not get better.
Instead of their situation becomes more severe than before, and if it is unfortunate, they might be a corpse that will be brought home here.
In short words, this syndicate is doing a clear fraud that I have built a clinic kuno there in Makati so that their task will look legitimate.
Until now, there is still no cure for many kinds of cancer and this is the taking advantage of this syndicate to profit from and give false hope to those who are suffering.
That is why I am calling for Health Secretary Enrique Ona and the management of the Philippine Medical Association (PMA) and even at the National Bureau of Investigation and Philippine National Police to investigate the burial of the said syndicate of cancer treatment scam.
The people are waiting for your quick action!
Wait for it!
