You might get electrocuted.

The media Organization is fiesta which is openly anti-Katoliko every time Pope Francis has a announcement.
They are hers in the angle of the news in favor of their agenda or motive.
Especially here in the latest perspective about abortion and homosexuality of the Pope.
The media see what they want to see.
And, they are writing this deliberately there is a color to be more tricked and maligaw.
Notice, "just the international news organization is the misinterpret - even local media joined.
They were shocked when the expakikipag of Papa was published with the Australian priest who was in favor of the gay marriage.
It seems that they celebrate that the Rome has become liberal because of Pope Francis but - they suddenly get confused when a priest will be punished in an issue related to homosexuality.
This is just proof or an indication that their assumption is wrong with the true message of the Pope.
That is why we are practicing Katoliko, let us not simply believe the colorful binabalita about our faith.
Let us know first the source, and then we read or watch the whole of what we love Pope Francis.
We truly have a lot to learn from our new pastol but it is better that we will be careful that we will not be able to deliver those who have bad intentions.
You should take good care of the news coming out and you get rid of it.
Pray and ask for guidance of the Banal Espiritu for the discerities.
What you look for is the consistency of the message.
The truth will be together.
No matter how you even reverse it... it's still the same.
Consistent.
It is, if you do not add the announcement, view, or action... surely, "that is wrong to understand the real spirit of the message.
"BE hindi natatakot," said the former Papa Juan Pablo II.
Do not worry about it because God will not forsake you to succeed those who are spreading mistakes about our being Catholic.
We just need to stay dilding and, alert, and critical.
