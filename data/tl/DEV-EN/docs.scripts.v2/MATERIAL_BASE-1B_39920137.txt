By Al S. Mendoza June 24, 2016, By Al S. Mendoza June 24, 2016 was buried in NBA finals after the attack of Miguel Tabuena in the 116th US Open golf championship.
I cannot remember that Filipinos were able to enter the US Open aside from Tabuena.
To be given an Eclipse of a chance that the Olympic Games will be a ticket for the Olympic Games.
Tabuena passed the hole of the needle.
To reach Tabuena in Oakmont, Pennsylvania, he has experienced severe challenges.
But with the two torches allocated for those who want to go to the US Open, Tabuena was leading.
Both in America made the elimination and let Tabuena's opponents in California.
"I still cannot believe it almost," said Tabuena.
"I really dream of the US Open."
Oakmont is one of the hardest golf course.
He does not have water but full of sandals.
Singing the allegiance of its fairways.
But on the first day, Tabuena fought his 4-over-PAR 74.
Luckily in his Second round of 80 and he did not escape the last 2 rounds.
Other 147-cut This 154.
However, he was still admired by the US Open that won by Dustin Johnson, American.
Tabuena is only 21 and he will be successful.
Those who have tried in the US Open at a young age is an experience of a lifetime.
To me, he's also a success.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
