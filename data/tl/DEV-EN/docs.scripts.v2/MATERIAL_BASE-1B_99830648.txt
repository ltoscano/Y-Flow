What: Butch returns to PSC By Al S. Mendoza July 1, 2016 in the return of Butch Ramirez as chief of the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC), expect significant changes in sports.
If before, the PSC is almost leaning on PAGCOR when it comes to its fund every year, Butch's strategy is different.
Aside from PAGCOR, Butch thanked the private sector to support the grassroots and Elite sports.
It is not new anymore but the private companies include that the funds of sports will increase even more.
Although PAGCOR contributed to the PSC, it is still not enough.
It is expensive to search for new talent in the government.
And it is more expensive especially the trening.
The residence, food and other sports of our athletes and coaches are not included there.
The PSC is in good hands especially with Ramon Fernandez, a pillars not only in basketball but under the leadership of direction.
I worked with Ramon and I really resourceful.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Butch is lucky for him.
As well as Charles Maxey.
As a former sports editor of SunStar Davao, he has a broad knowledge of sports.
If Ramon and Charles personally know, Fatima Kiram and Arnold Agustin are foreigners to me.
But because Butch is very big, we expect that the two are okay.
In the leadership of Butch, our athletes, it seems clear tomorrow.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
