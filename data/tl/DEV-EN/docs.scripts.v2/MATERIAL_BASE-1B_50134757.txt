Severe negligence of Filipino athletes should be faced by PNoy.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
If President Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino III wants to share this to the citizens who are criticizing her, I think that it is a big lifting if he will face the widespread problem in the Philippine sports.
We have a lot of robust athletes in the country.
But those who came from were not disgusted because they were neglected.
The Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) has millions of funds headed by Richie Garcia, but where goes?
Imagine, we have a medal, but it is cultural.
The Asian Games will be last!
'It's like pain in your head.
The size of the fund but it is cultural!
Especially in the Philippine Olympics Committee (POC) led by Unlce Peping.
There's a huge fund, but we don't have a remarkable compared to other Countries.
For us, it should probably be if the administration of PNoy should enter the worsening downfall of our athlete.
If it is allocated for a big fund but it is just cultural and we will always disarm the PSA and POC.
Or Better yet, replacing only two leaders who are leading it.
But before replacing the Commission on Audit... now, let us try the talent of Madam Heidi Mendoza, Madam Grace Pulido-Tan... MORE than a team with the PSA and POC... T'It's Madam Heidi "that!
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
