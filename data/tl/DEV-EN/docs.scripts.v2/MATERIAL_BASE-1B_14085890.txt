We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Every May Day, SONA, November 30, and other actions, the cry of "uring International Workers, Hunt," and "fooled!"
But no matter how Filipino workers understand the army to free the country from the understanding of the capital, that the release of the worker is on their own hands.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
The problem of the worker is himself, because he still has no trust in his own strength.
He still does not know his real strength, so he hasn't used it for his release and defending his interest, because the use and benefiting from the combined strength of the workers is the capitalists.
The worker still does not know that he is feeding the whole world.
The worker's confidence in business is clearly seen as "strength-making."
This is the business that are being sold by millions of workers in capitalists every day, and produces a lot of money on the profit of capitalists while the salary of the workers remains.
Filipino workers try to stop working and for sure to live in the factory, the running of economists of the country will stop, the entire capitalist system will stop.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
That is the strength of the workers that they haven't seen until now.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Because the worker thinks he is just a simple employee, simple workers who go back to their factory, factory or office to raise their own family in the development given by their capitalists or employer, they look at their jobs and income for the capitalists, that the capitalists are making them, when they are the ones who make the capitalists.
The worker should know himself as aware of the kind.
The worker still does not know that they are composed of a kind of society, which are all their interest in all of the same way to live, to be a slave to capitalists in exchange for the smallest salary, that they are all the same with their own creation.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
The worker needs to know himself as a kind, because this is the first field of the fight, to free the minds of the workers from the bankot which is a mentality that is built by capitalist system in the whole country, in the whole world.
In other words, the worker should not fit in the issue of rising wages, winning the living Wage, and being a good condition in the factory as the possible West slaves.
Most of all, they should be aware of the workers who have a goal to crush their rivals, the kind of capitalists.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
As aware of the workers, what should be prepared for is the construction of a society that will be transferred to the rotten and eaten systems, the success of the dictatorship of the workers, to rebuild their scheduled society, the society that does not take advantage of the people, the society that does not take advantage of the people, the civic SOStory.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
