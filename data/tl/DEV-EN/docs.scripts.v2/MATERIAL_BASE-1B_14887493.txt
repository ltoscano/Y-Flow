Duterte on the trash By Boyet Jadulco July 19, 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte was looking for an ally in the Senate to investigate the discretionary funds of the local government units (LGUs) especially on the matter of garbage.
Sen. Loren Legarda insisted that those LGUs were not able to get out of those who are not following the law of solid Waste management because aside from they have a discretionary funds, the law also ordered the solid Waste management.
According to Legarda, Ecological Solid Waste Management (EWSM) Law or the Republic Act 9003.
The law aims to have a clean environment by using a system of solid Waste management from the segregation of garbage, "segregated Transportation, Process, treatment and proper disposal of solid Waste."
The law will also encourage the recycling to reduce the garbage that will be thrown to sanitary Landfill.
Legarda who is sad that the majority of LGUs cannot be followed by the provisions of RA 9003, particularly in the decentralization of Waste collection, submission of Solid Waste Management (SWM) Plan, creating a local SWM boards, and the Mandatory Waste diversion.
In the report of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), at the end of 2015, around 36 percent of LGUs were just about 36 percent.
