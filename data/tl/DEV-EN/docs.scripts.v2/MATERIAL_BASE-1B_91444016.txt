We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
The Japanese were able to take a picture of their trash after their game against Ivory Coast in the World Cup, where they lost, 2-1.
Lost, cleaned.
The praises arrived in what they did.
The world showed the meaning of concern, and discipline.
Many were impressed by them.
I can be sure that there is no other country to do that, except if you have once again once again.
Japanese is known for discipline, order and following the authorities.
When the earthquake and tsunami in Japan hit Japan, the survivors who lined up while waiting for help from the government.
Compared to those that happened in Leyte and Samar, a few hours after the onslaught of typhoon Yolanda.
It is too far.
We have a lot to learn from Japanese.
But some were able to comment on what the Japanese did.
"Wierdo" they say.
It is probably not used to see the cleaning of their area.
It is used to spread and leave up to those who are set to clean.
In other words, they do not have a problem which is why they do not care.
If this year is like this, I cannot do anything, but just do not speak to those who are doing well.
Our culture needs such discipline.
On the road, you can see those who are throwing scattered everywhere.
Uploaded with cigarettes, packing, botelya of mineral water and too much food.
The garbage is not a problem, that's why it's just thrown anywhere.
In religious gatherings, mountains of garbage will be thrown anywhere.
And when it flooded with a little rain, the government will be blamed.
If only half of the entire population of the Philippines are parents like Japanese, we are probably progressing.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
