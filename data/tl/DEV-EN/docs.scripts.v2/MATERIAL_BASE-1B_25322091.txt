We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Goose to what I felt when I read a small photo caption about Energy Secretary Al Cusi.
Secretary Cusi was granted the painting (collector's item) that is a gift to him by diversity-gang Japanese aritist Keisman Tesla, who is known for his One-stroke Dragon technique, for the Duterte's kitchen feeding program.
But instead of cash to give the videos, they promised will have clarity, materials and other needs for Duterte's kitchen.
It's because it's because, because, it is only now that we have been able to make something like this with the government officials.
Most of the things we know are being used by a president in the position, the first thinking of how to make a "own fund" entering their pocket.
Secretary Cusi, his contribution to Duterte's kitchen feeding program is very conservative.
After all, he can use the unity given by the donation.
For sure, the Suppliers and videos of the Department of Energy (DOE) ran hurriedly for this project, closer to the little President.
But Secretary Al "did not do that, instead of granted a priceless possession.
A good example for other government officials.
Hopefully all government officials have this kind of thinking.
If they are like that, the former high texting people in the government will surely return.
Keep up the Good Work Secretary Al "Pon-sing" Cusi, kuk!
We're going to get a lot MORE.

We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
