That is why, it is only right that PBB lucky 7 is the most concept because there are only a few celebrities who are fighting to become a top of them.
According to the interview with Director Laurenti Dyogi, "in our long time in the air, it looks like the viewers already know the housemates (in the house of Brother).
"So they need a different experience and this is one attempt that they cannot believe that they are not in the house of Brother entering but they were invited to the other house of Big Brother."
It turns out "the show that she didn't want to say to us by Yassi Pressman that he will do because it is prohibited before, but confirmed that he is one of the housemates together with Juan Karlos Labajo, copri Park, Hashtag members Niki Natividad and McCoy de Leon.
Oh no, IT's possible to struggle with McCoy, Niki and JK.
