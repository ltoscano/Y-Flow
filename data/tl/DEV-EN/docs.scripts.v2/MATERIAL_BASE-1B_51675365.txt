We're going to get a lot MORE.

Since then, until now in the Duterte government, it was meaningful to write by Frederick Engels - it is good and transferred to the Filipino language.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
That is absolutely bad for Ka Luis, or Luis Maria B. Martinez, the exhibition of the Family, private Ariarian and state that translates to the Filipino of Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, a classic author of Frederick Engels.

We're going to get a lot MORE.
It took three decades before this published.
Ka Luis of Manila Critics Circle was once honored by the author of Renato Constantino like the Mis-Education of the Filipino and Roots of Subservience.
Aside from this, he is also a writer and companion.
He became a member of the youth Makabayan in the decades of being sold, became a student, moved to the ranks of the workers, and he became a house in the line up to martial law.

Ka Luis stated the importance of Origin of the Family in the conflict.
He said: "The Origin and other authors who belong to the so-called Marxist duck are offering a new perspective about social interaction.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
He stated that our current status is not eternal - that the world is not a "Valley of tears" which is our fate until the grave result of the "first wrongdoing."
In the advancement of history, he added, the people will reach free, peaceful and prosperous life wherein no abuse of people in the people and the social development of everyone as the basis of the liberal development of each other. "
For Ka Luis, the Origin is important to see the real traits of the state.
He explains: "In Origin, it is saying that the state will go to the society but it will continue to separate.
This is accepting that the society has a glamour of a rift, in the opposing sides or kind, and so that the society will not be crushed on their arguments, the state is necessary.
The state, starting and hit, became a bit of a kind - in a variety.
He became a furniture in abuse and oppression of those who have no assets - the masses of farmers and workers. "
Although this, the Origin shows that sometimes the state of the people, which can be seen now in the speech of the Duterte government.
According to Ka Luis: "I mentioned the Engels Solon that he pulled the pananda and put it on the ground and put the Griots who have been paid for debts and made slaves to other towns."
However, Ka Luis also says that he does not know where Duterte can do his proposals.
The six transactions in the country are deep in the inheritance of the colonists.
He will clapping his transactions, he said, to solve criminality and traffic because they are also benefiting from it.

"But we will know in endo or contractors what they will become.
IT's Land reform and anti-mining.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Whatever, Duterte needs our whole support.
The strong support of the people is his only wish to give four to the strength of transactions, local and foreign. "
Not only Origin is the answer of Ka Luis.
A few of these are communist Manlation of Marx and Engels, Wage, price, Profit and Wage-Labour's Capital of Marx, The German Ideology of Marx, a few episodes of the Anti-Duhring of Engels, and The Woman Question of Lenin.

Now, he is making the Condition of the working Class in England of Engels.
It was amazing, but the transfer of his personal interests, and in 1976 he started.
We speak to Ka Luis, "I am having a hard time to understand the works that are published in the foreign language.
I need to consult the predictions that I am reading, that is why I am making the Filipino language in the Filipino language. "
Many of the translation of Ka Luis is a letter-hand or now, and labelled.
There are also those who will be lost, or against the current rat or anay.

"I also cannot deny that there is an interest to release the author."
But, of course, his joy is full of joy when the translation has been published, read and understood, especially the workers.
