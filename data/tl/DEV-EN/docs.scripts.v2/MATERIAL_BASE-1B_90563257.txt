We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
There is a hint of revenge.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
The Catholic bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) commented on the failure of the administration of President Benigno Simeon Aquino III to raise the quality and level of the lives of the people but it is saddening that revealing it seems to be a result of revenge than love in the country.
According to a statement of CBCP recently, the steps of the current administration lacks to stop corruption, spread of crime and ease the poverty of the country.
Even the bishops have said the ongoing violation of human rights and extrajudicial killing.
They also said, the human rights of the people for certain jobs, decent houses, akses of the right and cheap medicines, de quality education and rights to inherit the land farming (jab in Hacienda Luisita,) while it creates new rights (statement on the RH Law but it is an "unexpected acceptance of this).
They also criticized the failure of the administration to pass the Freedom of Information Bill that will give way to research and the transactions that the government entered.
The administration is very funny in the FOI when its government program is "straight path."
"Why are they afraid to hand over the people the truth behind their leadership?
I cannot say anything wrong with the criticism of CBCP because those are true.
However, what I wonder is that this is also the problems we are facing during the time of the regime of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo but why did they have no reaction to this?
I remember that if the people are calling for many times for this letter of the Aquino regime but it remained parked in their pluma.
Their mouth is shut despite the corruption that circulated at that time, instead of dancing to Macapagal (like dancing to the dictator Ferdinand Marcos in the first part of the time of his dictatorship).
It can be recalled that some of these will receive a lot of favor from Macapagal, like an example of the grand Sports Utility vehicle (SUV) Mitsubishi Montero (which brought back).
That's why the statement of CBCP is obvious that it is just revenge with the current administration especially if it was noticed that only when failing to stop the passing of the Reproductive Health Bill that pushed for President.
S. Aquino.
Even though it looks like the bishops have another motive for the statement they did, the truth in their message should not be neglected.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
