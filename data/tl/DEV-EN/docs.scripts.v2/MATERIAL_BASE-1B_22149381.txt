It was past the neuro-psychological, medical examinations, agility test, background investigation and panel interview with 67 new agents of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency.
PDEA introduced the new agents from "faith" Class, the 6th batch of Drug Enforcement Officers who were training 6 months at PDEA Academy in Silang, Cavite.
In the 6th Commencement Exercises for the Drug Enforcement Officers Basic course in PDEA Gymnasium, PDEA Director General Undersecretary Arturo Cacdac Junior is very happy with the 67.
Some of them are sensible and some of them will deliver the way towards harm?
The drugs and plague of society are not unknown to us, that is why many are sensible and respected individuals who are involved in drugs.
Is this not the problem of PDEA, some of these who are proud of Cacdac?
Lily's Files reports that hopefully there is no small path to the new agent.0or once I spoke to some tricycle drivers of different Toda in Quezon City and they said that many of the drivers are "addicts" in drugs.
We believe in what our interviewed said, especially those who are together.
Why does the Toda Officers do not do anything if they know that their members are using drugs?
Why do they need to play blind in these vices of drivers?
Can they still wait for accident or an accident?
It would have been okay if only they will be hurt.
What if they even have no idea that passengers will be involved, especially the children?
Hopefully, in the tricycle operators, before they accept their drivers, they should know if they are involved in drugs or they should know if they are using them.
