I received a tip from a trusted source about the sidelines of a new syndicate that is moving here in the country.
This syndicate is composed of some corrupt individuals from China who introduce themselves as an expert in treatment and healing of people who are sick of cancer.
And because of this in the Philippines, they are automatic that they have an accomplice of course, of course they are Filipinos who are the doctors.
The sidelines of the syndicate was hit in big hospitals where there are rich patients who are sick of cancer.
If they have found a target victim, they will talk to him and with the help of the Filipinos who often travel to China, they will introduce an experiment or cancer treatment specialist from the said country.
And because of the sales Talk of these fools, it is certain that they convince the desperate patients to go to the country to have a treatment of their disease.
What's worse here is to spend millions of patients but when they return they will not get healed.
Instead, their situation becomes more severe than before, and if they are unfortunate, they might have a corpse to be taken back home.
In other words, a clear fraud is being done by the syndicate that I heard was built by a clinic and there in Makati so that their tasks might look legitimate.
Until now, there is still no cure for many kinds of cancer and this is the advantage of this syndicate to earn and give false hope for those suffering from patients.
That is why I am calling for Health Secretary Enrique Ona and to the management of the Philippine Medical Association (PMA) and even the National Bureau of Investigation and Philippine National Police to investigate the lies of the said syndicate of cancer treatment scam.
The people are waiting for your quick action!
Wait for it!
