By Al S. Mendoza December 30, 2016, the decision of the PSC-POC (Philippine Sports Commission-Philippine Olympic Committee) Task Force has been fine.
This is the consent they let go to the 2017 Malaysia SEA Games for our 13 athletes to join the 2016 Rio Olympics.
That should be.
They are still the most bonfire at all.
Olympic weightning silver medalist Hidilyn Diaz will be athletes who do not need to pass through the SEA Games qualifying tryouts.
The restrictions of Diaz are boxer Charly Suarez and Rogen Ladon, hurdler Eric Cray, long jumper Maresis Torres, marathoner Mary Joy Tabuena, taekers Jessie Khing Lacfirst and Jasmine Alkhaldi.
You will stop playing in any Olympics that means that you are really a caliber athletes.
The Olympic Games could not be compared to the Asian Games.
The SEA Games?
For those who are kneeling in the Olympics, it seems like the SEA Games will just feel like them.
In other words, the SEA Games is just like a barangay tournament for ex-Netherlands.
And because of the difficulty entering the Olympic proper, the free ticket going to the SEA Games is also a reward for the Netherlands.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
I hope they win Malaysia?
Happy New Year!
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
