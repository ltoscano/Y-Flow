The United Sates Navy on the anomalous contract of Global Terminals & Development, Inc.
(Global) and former management of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA).
This is the truth: It seems that the SBMA back to the three ports of the former ship repair facility of the US Navy because of the said contract that will continue to be existing despite the Deputy Administrator for Legal Affairs and Seaport Department of SBMA.
This past week, a US Navy supply ship almost cannot anchor because Global does not want to anchor.
Because they are not the ones talking to the Americans for the services he needs.
The US Navy has its own bidding on public service and supply but wants to take all Global voices from Subic, particularly the former SRF compound, the anchor of the ship, based on its contract.
It is not expected that the Americans will not expect all of these kinds of Global voices because aside from the liberal business, there is a particular need that this will not be given by the Global and of course, it is natural to socialize.
Global voices have been strong because of the much-known contacts in the Senate like Senator Loren Legarda who is from Malaca√±ang and even presidential sister Kris Aquino, who recently visited the Segara Hotel owned by Global, associate and family Gordon, who is also inside the SRF compound.
It looks like the current SBMA Board will not take action against the anomalous contracts that were entered by those earlier because of fear that they will spread the position.
This is the truth: If President Noynoy Aquino's platform is really straight path, he will let the "blame" of the SBMA the private company of the very large asset of the government that puts the uncertainty in the orderly implementation of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) of the Philippines and the US.
It is affected not only the businesses but also the security and territory of the country who stole or occupied by China in the West Philippine Sea so it is just proper to take action in taunting Global voices.
This is the truth!
