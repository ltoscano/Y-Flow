We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
No priest...
No mass: (Reposted & Revised) reflection for Holy Thursday - Year B - April 2, 2015 - YER OF THE PORS
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
There is one mother who is trying to wake up his child: "Hoy is extravagant!
Wake up and get caught in the mass! "
Her daughter replied: "Mother, give me two wonderful reasons for me to rise."
The mother replied, "Iho, the first is already saving money and you are not needed to get up.
Second, you are the one to make it!
You are extravagant!
Let us!! "
The mother is right because there is no mass Kif there is no priest and I do not have a mass!
This Thursday Pope has two celebrations: The removal of priesthood and after being strong by Sakramento of the holy Eukarisaunt.
Two vehicles that will never be separated.
"The Lord Jesus, last night he was taking the bread, thanked, and he was divided, and said," Ito my body that was filed back to you.
Do this in remembering me. "
In the holy division of our Lord Jesus, he gave us the two big signs of love of God to people.
Priesthood is the symbol of trust in us that although we are not worthy of us and chosen to join us in his mission of serving.
Eukarisaunt is the symbol of the loyalty and love that led to the offer of his life for our safety.
This day, let us show our love to our priests.
Let us just look for them to remain honest and diligent in sharing their vocation.
May they remain a furniture so that the love of God will bring to the people.
In this day, may we feel the absolute love of us by God every time we get the Santa mass.
His body and blood is his one to offer a new life.
That is why every approach of the administration should give us hope that we can help Christ.
Love if you love him.
Forgive how to forgive him.
Serve how he served.
We are called to be like His.
We should be Christ for others!
And this year's Dancing or Year of the Poor, we should try to be Christ to our siblings who are poor.
Like Jesus who has a unique regard for the duo hoping that we should also be "Eukarisaunt" or thanks to our siblings who are unfortunate.
Our help to them will help them, especially to their needs, this is a big or small, the blessing they thank while they live.
With what we continue to help them, we have not noticing it, it becomes "Eukarisaunt" (gratitude) for others.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
