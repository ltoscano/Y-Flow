Horses In: Running By Andy Series July 7, 2016 instead to strengthen the annual triple Crown Series in the country, the excitement of the racing fans will be more missing because of the changes that are not needed.
This is the opinion of the experts in the race because of the lack or lack of robust 3-year-old colts and fillies that he is speaking for the big projects that are ready for the annual Eclipse series.
This year, another race that was accompanied by the two big sensual traditions were included in the triple Crown Series - the 3-Year-Old Stakes, with a total to 500,000 pesos.
This is a new feature of the three-leg series aside from the main race with a total to be P3-million and Hopeful Stakes which has a total Prize of P1-million.
Instead of helping the excitement of the two races every leg, the contestants were reduced because of the temptation of the contestants to have been tested when the two main races mentioned.
The result has lost appropriate entries especially in the main race that should be given importance to the main focus of triple Crown Series.
Instead of taking a 3-year-olds to fight for their old age, "running" continues to perform good at first or second leg in Hopeful Stakes or just there at 3 -Year-Old Stakes.
So look at the outcome of the participants in the third leg of the triple Crown Series, experts say in IT.
