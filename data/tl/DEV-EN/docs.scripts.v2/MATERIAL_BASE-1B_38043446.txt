On December 4, Dollesbrough lost last December 4, while the joint troops of the PNP Public Safety Company and the 31st Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army in the said incident was operation.
According to the witness, the victim was walking home when he encountered drunk soldiers.
Dollesex was last seen while being beaten by the soldiers.
Dollesex is the former mandering of the NPA who has long left the service and worked as a helper in the woods.
To our knowledge, he does not have any wrongdoing or crime.
The only possible reason for the murder of him by the troops of the government is his former participation in leaving the armed struggle.

It is just proper to keep the hurricane experienced by Dollesex in the hands of the government troops.
He is a civilian and the murder of him is against all the laws about human rights and insurers.

We're encouraging the relatives of Dollesbrough not to keep quiet and be defeated in fear.

We assure all of them to make a move from the Spanish movement to hold the criminals responsible for this crime.
