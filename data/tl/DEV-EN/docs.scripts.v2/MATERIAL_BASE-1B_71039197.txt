Force to force
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
To be honest, we don't need a lot of money to be happy.
The frequent conflict is that if there is no money and a lot of people think that is a problem but if we want to be happy, there is a way, especially this Christmas.
This is the principle being implemented by the local government unit of QC.
Despite the extensive call not to hold a Christmas party, Mayor Bistek Bautista and Vice Mayor Joy Belmonte agreed to not lose the spirit of Christmas for the residents.
You saw the beautiful lights in the city hall and in the QC Circle, the heart will rise and makes you happy.
Is the money spent here?
The news is that residents contribute to the ability.
The Christmas present was also not gone.
Yes and there are no parties, but it does not mean that the residents will not follow the Christmas day.
The QC also understands the situation of our countrymen in areas affected by typhoon Yolanda and earthquake.
They are the ones who lost all properties and lost someone, how can they make it right now?
But, the local government QC is one of those who sympathize with the victims.
Mayor Bistek and VM Belmonte provided the help of 50 million to the victims.
I hope that the money from Quezon City will reach and contribute.
This is not the first sympathy of QC to the Filipinos who are victims of calamities.
Even back then, there is a need, first in line the QC to the towns that are ready to contribute.
The happy resident is important in QC, and this is what pushed Mayor Bistek was Vice Mayor Joy to force the "strit of Christmas holiday" in the whole city.
We can do it, if you want it.
We are more helpful to those who are lonely if we are not only able to consolidate but be included in our enjoyment.
A little thing, great lights, a little contributed to those who suffer from poverty, it is fine.
What is important is that the government is hardworking that we make it happy.
