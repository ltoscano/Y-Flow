Think of Ginebra?
By Al S. Mendoza October 19, 2016 for Barangay Ginebra, this is the day that he should ask for the crown.
If not, the Gin Kings are dangerous in Game 7.
Meralco will commit suicide now to ask for the 3-3 series for the PBA Governors "Cup.
This is what Ginebra needs to solve this: The dead is the act of the Bolts.
What Ginebra should do?
If Meralco wants to run, it should be stopped.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Slowbreak and unquick break.
If it is around the middle, Meralco will push through, Ginebra is avoiding.
Bolt Cliff Hodge
There are those who are around three with Hodge and Reynel Hogan.
IT's Jimmy Allardyce, the New king of a three-point shot.
For Meralco, it should not be taken from the astronomers coach Norman Black and his assistant.
Damage the focus.
They are able to pass the Gin LA Tenorio, which is not just passed but rushing.
Not only two or three.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
And add Sol Mercado, the latest in the arch of Ginebra.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
The worst, Meralco import Allen Durham.
Bolt Chris Newman
But he was able to undergo stab when he was not in the place.
Meralco almost respects 6 "9" Japeth Aguilar.
Because of that, Japeth is likely to lock the success of Ginebra.
But Tenorio is still the one holding the key of the win.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
