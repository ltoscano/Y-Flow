The said takeout offensive was done by the BST inside the percussion of the 16th IB-PA.
59th IB-PA, SAF-PNP and RMG-PNP.
This shows that the enemies are not successful to crush the Spanish movement under Oplan Unity.
Instead of getting crushed, the swearing in the province is growing.
The success that is here is a simple idea to declare that Oplan Unity in the province of Rizal failed.
It is the BMI that the people supports, will not need to crush.
Instead, it will be stronger and will continue to fail in any counter-insurgency under the US-Aquino regime.
