For Ramirez, he is not against the Fil-foreign athletes or imported coach, but it is really good to see and winning as a Filipino athletes will win a gold medal in international competition for the Philippines.
To execute this thing, his agency will focus on the National Youth Games, Batang Pinoy Championships, Philippine National Games and settlement competition to find those with good enough athletes.
