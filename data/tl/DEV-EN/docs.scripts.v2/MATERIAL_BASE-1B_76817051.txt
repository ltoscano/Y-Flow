Happy Christmas!
By Chingbee December 22, 2016 from Dec.
25, Christmas Day, the balikbayan boxes brought or sent by OFWs in the Philippines will pour in for their respective loved ones.
Because in the day of Christmas, the tax-exemption of balikbayan boxes that the content is worth P150,000 per OFW or returnees.
If you notice, we did not say that P150,000 per box but per OFW or returnees because P150,000 is the total Value of tax exemption per delivery or home.
12.50K total so, you might think there will be MORE than three boxes, the Value of every one box is 12.50,000 or total of P450,000 for three boxes.
That is not like that, okay?
Anyway, the administration has given a huge favor of the tax exemption of P150,000 because before, only 10,000 pesos is the Value of the contents of the balikbayan boxes that cannot be restored.
Just the same, for every year, the OFW or balikbayan box tax exemption three times is possible.
Thrice so, in a year, with the three availability of the privilege, it can P450,000 worth of goods which can be tax exempt.
The privilege is not absolute because there is a conditions imposed so that the tax exemption will not be used in smuggling the goods.
The conditions should be personal effects on the contents of the balikbayan box or "the items used (secondhand) or if before, personal belongings of the one sent or sent.
Non-commercial does not have a commercial to be sent.
For example, ita-tax "is the Customs of P150,000 worth of perfumes in your box or even P150,000 worth of alcohol.
To be safe, you will just be swayed by maximum two items per category.
For example, two bottles of perfumes and two bottles of alcohol.
More blessings Truly, the Christmas of OFWs and returnees will be good because of the tax exemption of balikbayan boxes, disappearance of planting-bullet extort scam in NAIA and the better operation of our airports.
