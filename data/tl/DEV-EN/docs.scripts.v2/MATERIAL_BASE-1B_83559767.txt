In relation to the consecutive attacks on illegal gambling for the widespread protests in Calabarzon, we have found out that RD General Benito Estimates themselves ordered the Provincial directors to sweep the Catalan government.
Because of that, the PD has proven that it is only temporary if they will be able to sneak through RD Estimates.
With the dedication of his duty and being sensitive to the reports about his AOR, we believe that this official is still far from the field of public service.
We do not have an attitude to taste it as a result, but with what you did, General Estimates sir, let me count me as one of the chairs of the PNP top brass!
I salute you, sir! - if you are confused by some groups on social networking sites because it becomes a huge inconvenience for the community because it becomes the cause of bullying, bringing out their resentment and source of conflicts.
In Masbate, there is a group on Facebook that should be given attention to the national or international level.
Because, in my limited knowledge, this is the first in the whole country (maybe even in the whole world) who are living in different parts of the world have a relationship for one goal: To help others!
The group of Milagros Ako (TMA on Facebook), at the start, became a way to those from Milagros, Masbate to make any time, wherever they are there.
We feel at first that this will be given to loneliness by the members of the TMA who are in far places because they dated the events in Milagros, in Masbate and even in the whole country.
But in the end there was an idea that This was immediately supported by absolutely (the others were tired) by the members until they were successful, the project was asked to be distributed for the "anaksweat" of Milagros which is the "Pilot area" in the West island, Pob.
West, Milagros.
This was immediately followed by giving a "wheelchair" to Ilo Medina, of Barangay.
Bacolod, which was initially went to by the doctor in their house in connect and pictures of TMA members.
The shelf is lacking in thanks to This, but I feel MORE than accepted that the feeling of every member of This: The significant "pro-God happiness" in what they're doing is real service to others!
In spite of these restrictions, may I contribute to the TMA to increase their pro-God and pro-year goal that I know that there are still many subsequent tasks in the coming days.
In This members, now you have proved that there is no need to be a politician and people who take advantage in the treasury of the country to execute the so-called fabulous!
And to the followers of our column, Burdado, it is known for a private or not wanting to cooperate with this kind of goal, just go to Facebook the group. "
I am Milagros I.
I salute you all!!!
