Diego Wadagan NPA-Abra, Agustin Begnalen Command In 2 February, 2013
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
The behind-up statements of the 503rd Brigade of the Philippine Army, and the PNP-Cordillera are partners in relation to some events recently in Abra, related to the NPA.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
First is the alleged surrender of Connie Santiago Valera, 29 years old, of Poblacion Lacub for Abra.
Cordillera Police Director Chief Superintendent Benjamin Magalong, a high leader of the Ilocos-Cordillera Regional Committee of CPP and # 5 in the 4th quarter "Order of Battle" of 2012.
It is not an official of Agustin Begnalen Command, Connie Santiago Valera, and the higher leader of the Ilocos-Cordillera Regional Committee of CPP.
Modus operandi of officials of the AFP and PNP, which is frankly high-ranking officials of the CPP-NPA-NDF are the ordinary citizens who are suspected to be implicated or forced to go into the "reward money" which costs several million pesos.
It can be recalled that the government of PNoy appointed more than P400M for the reward of the arrest of the leaders of CPP-NPA-NDF.
That is why there are some ordinary citizens who are being arrested and made by the high-ranking officials of CPP-NPA-NDF.
On the other hand, the criminals General Jovito Palparan, who cannot be arrested even if there is a small pile on the head, because of the adopt of AFP and PNP for her.
Second is the alleged four (4) NPA who were killed in an encounter between the forces of the 41st IB and the NPA in Lagangsome, Abra.
It is true that there is a fight between the forces of the 41st IB and the NPA under the Procopio Tauro Front in Mansour, Kayapa, Lagangsome on 9: 15 in the morning, November 30, 2013.
But contrary to the statement of the 41st IB and 503rd Brigade of the Philippine Army, no NPA died, or even wounded.
On the other hand, there were not less than 2 soldiers of the 41st IB was rushed to the hospital after the said fight.
But the bigger issue after this fight is the illegal arrest and hold of 4 Filipino masses from Kayapa, Lagangsome of the AFP members.
They said they were together in the neighborhoods to find a group on January 30, 2013, on the day of the fight, but only now returned and threatened by the AFP not to tell about what happened to them.
The old masses were Anaclein "Killis" Tugade, Ceferino "Boying" Poclani (Barangay Country Kayla), Jemmy Esmie Bageng, and Bonifacio "Pacio" seems like.
The relatives immediately searched for the 503rd Brigade HQ in Barbarit, Lagangsome of the said missing masses, but the AFP told the NPA to look for it.
None of the NPA, and it is not the work of the NPA to catch and especially the ones who killed no other individuals, unlike the AFP and PNP.
Will they not be the agan of the 503rd Brigade of the killed NPA?
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
In addition, before the fight, the soldiers were beaten by 41st IB Mayor Mayor Alcantara, a youth from Kayapa, Lagangsome, Abra.
Mayor Alcantara is suspected to be supporters of the NPA.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Again, the officials of the AFP in the act of 4 NPA rebels who were killed in the fight, submit a very beautiful report for their promotion and lot of money on their retirement.
He added, the aim of the actions that they are working with perfumes to the vast citizens, while more likely they are the ones responsible for the disappearance of 4 people from Kayapa.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
The institution of PNP and AFP are rotten in the depths.
Officials Are corrupt and liar.
More than that, they are not fighting for the interest of the people, but the interest of others who have contributed to the kind and foreign monopolies.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
This is the reason why Oplan Unity continues to fail and being pushed by the democratic revolution of the country, leading to the stages of its involvement until the definition of success.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
