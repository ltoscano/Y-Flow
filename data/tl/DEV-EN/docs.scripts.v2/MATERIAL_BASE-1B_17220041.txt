Diaz cheerleader in SEAG By Ramil Cruz December 30, 2016 will be a cheerleader and inspiration for the Philippine Contingent of the 29th Southeast Asian Games (SEAG) this coming August 19-31, 2017 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics Women's weightning silver medalist Hidilyn Diaz.
But the 25-year-old, 4-foot-11 and Zamboanga City native will be a big time, 4-foot-11 and Zamboanga City native to his three colleagues for biennial sports.'
The Philippine Weightlifting Association ('A) president Monico Puigevella said the event of women were disintegrated by the Malaysia SEA Games Organizing Committee (MASOC) the event of women that's why there is no weightning Women's division.
"I already talked to him as a cheerleader to let us first and give inspiration to his colleagues who are part of the SEA Games," said Puigevella, who was appointed in his former office when Roger Dulplan recently resigned recently.
"He has a Promise, even with the SEA Games, one of the Legalizing Olympic qualifying tournament for 2020 Tokyo, he will go with the national weightlifting team in the SEA Games," Puigevella said.
The loss of female weightlifting in the country has a huge blow from the birth of a sixth place in the medal standings.
Diaz has a big fight with the 53-kilogram category that was sent to Rio last August and was denied.
"The MASOC removed all the event of women in weightlifting.
"I don't know how IT will affect Our campaign, Our favourite PSC-POC Task Force SEA Games should look into how many gold medals were Won by Our lady athletes the last time around and then look and other sports that also removed the Women's event," said Puigevella.
