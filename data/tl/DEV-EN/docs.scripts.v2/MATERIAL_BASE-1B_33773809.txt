According to PDEA, last week, a nurse received three boxes of gifts that contains brownies as a gift to his birthday and said brownies are supposedly together with 17 employees of the said hospital.
After eating, the health worker felt nausea and pain, so they were immediately given first aid.

It is said that marijuana is the most important drug, and whoever tasted or using it is possible to find a stronger kind of drugs.
