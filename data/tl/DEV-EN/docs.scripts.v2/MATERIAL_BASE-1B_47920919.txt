What is the reason of President Benigno Aquino III and he wants in another place to commemorate the People Power Revolution instead of its original place in EDSA?
Is it just fair to do this in places destructed by typhoon Yolanda wherein thousands have lost their lives and livelihood?
Stop President.
Noynoy is saying that the reason is he wants to be with the victims of cruel nature because it is not true.
If President wants it.
Aquino to be with them to show his sympathy, it would have been long since most of them have already recovered from the help of foreigners and private people.
What did the government help through the trust of PNoy?
Well, most of them really got money from.
How can the President and the assemblies say that they have helped the recovery of the victims when many are still protesters because instead of helping them, they became a victim.
No one can be proud of the Aquino administration that has been done in the Philippines.
It turns out that they were wrong, they were able to do something - the poor and to have money from the rich, especially the members of the KKK who respond to relatives, friend, Kaklase and Kabarilan.
Instead of making progress, the country is getting worse in poverty.
And so that not to be irritated, PNoy is touring the Filipinos.
Wait a wait.
Is it that PNoy is just afraid to meet in the "conflict" the personalities who play an important role in the People Power Revolution?
So if they unite to do the People Power and oust Noynoy.
Nothing is impossible in the time now.
That is why the President should think or even those who is against his ear to fix the ruling in the country.
