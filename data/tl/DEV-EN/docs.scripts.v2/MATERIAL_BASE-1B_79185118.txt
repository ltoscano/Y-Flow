Bela Padilla, Camp winner, the heart By Jun Lalin August 11, 2016, has long been gone through the cast of Ang Promise of Bela Padilla, but about the action-packed series of ABS-CBN, starring Coco Martin was asked by other people during her interview at the press conference of the movie Camp Crame.
Feeling from others, the disappearance of Bela in the said series has another reason.
It's because you have a chatter then that one of his co-colleagues are insecure to him.
"Actually, I'm so thankful that I became a part of Ang Probabwe.
"The role I played there, but I even reached 29 weeks with the original, 8 weeks that I should be there," Bela explained.
He should not discuss about his loss to Ang Probabwe because it has been a long time ago and he is busy now in the screening of Camp Crame.
Even about the feelings of Camp Crame, it can't be said that Bela is heartbroken when it comes to lovelfe.
Going stronger is their relationship with businessman / producer Neil Arce.
