It is sad to report that four students are the new victims of hazing of a fraternity.
One, Guillo Cesar Series, 18, died after the difficulty of hurting her was not resourceful.
The Manila Police District has a lead to catch those who were conducting hazing to Servando, sophomore student of De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde.
The three companions of Series, students of said school, are recovering in the Philippine General Hospital.
They are still alive to solve the case.
They should be guarded by the authorities and implemented the witness protection program.
According to the police report, after hazing, they were just dropped in a condominium in Manila.
It is appointed Alpha Kapor Rho (AKHO) to recruit the victims.
Every time the start of school starts or the classes are not passed in a whole year, it is impossible that there is no student who is reported to be victims or killed in hazing.
At the time, violence among young people will "not be seen on the streets but in schools and university."
Even the soreness goes by the cruel ritual.
There are many reasons why there are young people who are sabotaging the fraternity: To be a cool; magooon with new gangs; and have protection in bullying by some groups.
Although there is a law against hazing that RA 8049 passed in 1991 after the death of Leni Villa, student of Ateneo de Manila School of Law, the violent and heinous murders under the said ritual continues.
Even hazing in the military and the police Academy is difficult to end.
This is one of the said reasons why some of those who are working at the Philippine Military and National Police Academy are becoming violent, cruel, month and coming to a point violating human rights in service.
Hazing are also widespread even in institutions that are said to have a high level of teaching.
According to Senator Tito Sotto, the killer of hazing will continue if the Department of Justice (DOJ) will not be resolved.
"One of the previous hazing incidents have been solved.
The DOJ should put more effort in the prosecution of these cases.
Otherwise, there will be more deaths to come. "
There is no ability or it seems that the state does not want to punish those responsible for hazing.
The fraternity, particularly in the legal profession, will continue to refuse to punish the "siblings" who were sentenced to form.
The case of Leni Villa lasted for 20 years before his family served justice.
Violence and brutality should not be allowed or promoted to groups or brotherhood.
The management of the university and student councils should act on the formation of advocacy and campaign which will instruct the students to avoid the monster brotherhood.
Stop hazing!
