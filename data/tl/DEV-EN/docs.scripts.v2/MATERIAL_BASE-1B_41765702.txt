Pass through sports.

These past few days, the feelings of Filipinos are powering about basketball.
There are many who went here to the Philippines, international basketball superstars and they all know about the affection of Pinoy fans in basketball.
Even the fight of UST and La Salle became emotional and all of them watched.
Filipinos are really sporting.
That is why my belief is getting better because it is a big thing to have a so-called sports tourism.
I was still a councilor, I was sent to the Sports Tourism in QC.
I pushed for the event like QC vs. the World Bilbao tournament and the QC Chess Road show where the fights were made.
Not only basketball is allowed to be happy with tourism in the Philippines.
Boxing is leading, we have a lot of superstars on the field.
The bowling, the billiards, we have a lot of famous.
We can also spearhead water sports and we can show the beauty of the beach in the country.
There are still a lot of places in the Philippines that are good destination and perhaps the famous sportsman is to be famous, introduce themselves and help for the improvement of tourism in the country.
Tourism is a big potential for the Philippines especially if the famous athletes will use and especially because the story of our athletes are beautiful and truly can be an inspiration to anyone.
We hope that the government will take advantage of the fame of some of our sports people so that there will be a lot of interest and many attention to the Philippines.
If Pacman won his endorsement of a senator in America, just think of what he can do to the country if he will talk, and athletes like him, in the whole world about the beauty of our beloved country and encourage other races to include our country in their plans to visit as tourists.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
