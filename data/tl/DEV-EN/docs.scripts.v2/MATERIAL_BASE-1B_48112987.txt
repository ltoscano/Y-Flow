Frankly: Duterte has no immunity from the International Criminal Court By Ellen Tordesillas August 17, 2016 that President Rody Duterte is always saying that if he will be killed, his mind is the plague of society that is why he will not be charged with him while he is the president.
He said this when he visited the wounded soldiers in V. Luna AFP Medical Center and was annoyed by the businessmen "not following his order to stop" endo, "the abuse of the worker through five months of contract and is not becoming permanent at work.
"I am just warning: Stop contractualization or kill you," Duterte said.
"You know why I speak to the president?
While I am here, there is "legal" immunity. "
It is true that while he is president, he will not be charged in case.
That is stated in the Constitution.
That is right because if the President is worried about the cases that can be filed against him while making decisions on important things for the country, she might not already decide.
But it does not mean that if you are president, you can do whatever you want, even if it is against the law.
Many are worried about the many people connected to Duterte's campaign against illegal drugs.
Up to 646 have been killed since Duterte took office in Malacanang on June 30.
If it will be counted since he won last May 19, more than 800.
This is according to the number of Philippine Daily Inquirer (PDI).
Most of those who were killed were no charges and no warrant of arrest.
There are some cases of policemen who killed - allegedly fought and grabbed the gun even though the victim was handcuffed.
Most do not know who kills.
But Duterte defended the killing.
He told the soldiers when he visited Capiz: "If I ordered the killing of a person, I cannot arrest because I have a immunity.
"I have the power to pardon me and if you do my orders, I would pardon you."
Many are worried about what Duterte is saying.
Because it is not true that he is not in the jurisdiction of the law.
