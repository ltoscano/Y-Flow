The volleyball Guthao "isn't jealous of Pablo January 13, 2017, Michelle Guthao has confirmed his separation from Pocari and the team, but he said that he was jealous of the Eclipse of Myla Pablo.
In an interview by Volleyverd.com, Guthao announced that the problem with the management was the reason for his departure from the team.
"IT's a final thing."
I will leave Pocari and join another team after my contract passed last December 31, "Lahad of Guateao, who became an instrument for the successful campaign of Lady Warriors in the V-League season.
"Now that I started to sink to me that I will leave, to change my teammates.
Sad, but I need, they need all.
IT's gonna be for everyone for sure, "he continued.
His misunderstanding and the management is the reason why he opted to just leave.
But, Gumabao stressed that jealousy towards Pablo is the reason.
Pablo was given a Pocari and a long contract (in the history of the Philippine Football) with a brand New car as a signing bonus.
According to Gumabao, he is happy for Pablo, because he knows that it is hard to achieve said contract.
But, he said that the said multi-million contract has a wrong message, especially to the teammates they have not even able to sign even a year deal.
"I mean, I'm happy for Myla, She worked hard for whatever She signed on.
I love Her as a teammate, as a friend and as a sister.
So I will not be sessed if given to him "because I don't need IT.
I mean, I have a car, I have a house and a family that supports me, "said Guateao.
"All I asked for was a happy team.
And maybe I am a part of the team that is "that I am happy anymore."
