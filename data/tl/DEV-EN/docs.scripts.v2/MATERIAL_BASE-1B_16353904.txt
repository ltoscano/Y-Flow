Eric Pineda, business manager of Manny Pacquiao, said that the Pambansang Kamao will focus on his job as senator of the country and no plans to fight in October like the spreading news.
It can be recalled that Bob Arum has reservations with the Top Rank in Mandalay for October 15 of the possible comeback of Pacman against the option of Men Broner, Terrence Crawford or Danny Garcia.
Pacquiao is currently busy with his political career after he retired this year after his trilogy with Timothy Bradley was complete.
Pineda admitted in an interview by a respectable broad sheet that is really being made to convince the Pambansang Kamao to return to the ring in October for the said reserve date of the fight.
But Pacquiao rejected this because this time, the country's service was first to the Filipinos.
