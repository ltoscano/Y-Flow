It is not surprising why the support of investors and the payers to Kosehal Ali Aienza in Manila is full of support for the 2016 elections.
What is Ali the only first to stand and come from the plan of the current administration or the city government of Manila to raise 300 percent of the tax in Manila.
That's why Ali is opposing the City Council of some Countries such as Councilor Rod Lacsamana, and Josie Siscar.
Not only in the Council that Ali showed the resistance of the planned harassment of the city government to investors and citizens of the city but, he still faced Manila Mayor Joseph "Erap" Estrada.
He asked the father of the city to feel pity for the "children" (investors and citizens) - not to continue the plan to suffer the people - the plan to imposition of too much higher taxes on businessmen in Manila.
Ali's suggestion to Erap, instead of raising the tax, chase the unpaying and cheater in paying taxes and remove the tax exemptions.
Because of the fight of Ali, the planned 300% tax increase did not work.
Instead, the city government has done 150%.
But, the government is planning that the anticipated 150% will be imposed after the election.
Oh, tay.
That's why you are here in Manila, well, be careful in voting who will sit on you.
Do not give happiness to you.
Whatever it is, even if half of 300% imposed - it can be said that the resistance made by Ali is still a success.
It is also a big deal that is why the treasury of 150% increase.
Oh, if in case Ali and some colleagues have come from the city council, there is a huge 300% iho and daughter.
It's a good thing that Ali is like Ali for the people of Manila.
For now, according to the businessmen, they are still having difficulty because there are situations where they feel that the imposition of tax in Manila is not humane and fair.
Many complained because of the excessive height of the tax, particularly your small livelihood.
Like a small barbershop, he was charged with 20,000 (tax), and even the small various stores have not forgave him.
The businessmen in Manila said, the officials of Manila are not fair and fair because they are small and honest to pay tax, load a thin increase but the giant company of communication has been taken to tax.
He moved to tax, maybe BIR should investigate this - Paging Commissioner Kim Henares.
A giant Communication company, is being used to tax?
Is that possible?
The payers are thankful because even if they are alone, Ali Atienza was there and managed to standing up the City Council to stop the unjust tax increase.
They are also hoping that if Ali won as Vice Mayor of Manila to correct the wrong policies and ways to collect taxes.
The payers believe that only Ali is the one who will prevent the solution to get down the pay of those from Manila now.
"What they should be chased, kinds of tax evasion and not" those who are paying proper taxes and follow properly in the government. "
A businessman said, he does not want to be identified.
"As long as we support Ali, because we believe that he is the only one to bring the revival of the new Manila" statement by the businessman in the city.
