The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) is on alert after the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the New People's Army (NPA) today.
According to AFP Chief of Staff General Eduardo Año, President Rodrigo Duterte still remains and has not yet taken the order to hunt the said rebel group.
It can be recalled that those who introduced themselves as members of the NPA in Quezon City conducted a lightning rally in Quezon City as part of their anniversary which caused the severe traffic in the area.
Meanwhile, Año urged the leadership of the National Democratic Front (NDF) to control their armed men as proof that they will make the peace talks with the government.
The fourth conversation between the government and NDF in April is set to be rolled in April in The Netherlands.
