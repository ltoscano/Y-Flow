Baylor, Nueva Vizcaya, April 27 (Pia) - the Veterans Regional Hospital (VRH) recently launched a "Bike for Life" program to strengthen the partnership of employees, back up the healthy lifestyle and communicating with other government Hospitals in northern Luzon.
According to Dr. Cirilo Gtransldez, VRH chief, the launching of the "Bike for Life" program started in three days of expressing the death of 200 - kilometer road from San Jose City, Central Pangasinan, San Fernando La Union, Baguio City and Ammunition, Nueva Vizcaya.
"Because of this, health workers had a relationship with the other hospital of the government which we passed," Gtransldez said.
The group of "Bike for Life" program visited the medical centers of northern Luzon like Region 1 Training and Medical Center (R1TMC) in Dagupan City, Pangasinan, Ilocos Training and Regional Medical Center (ITRMC) in Baguio City.
According to Gtransldez, because of the success of launching the program, they will pursue it as a regular task to encourage others to join their advocacy about healthy lifestyle.
