ISPORT!: POC election push through?
By Zaldy Perez November 15, 2016 while the POC elections are approaching November 25, the worry or doubts will push through if this will push through.
The dates were also set by the Senate committee hearing in the leadership of Fighting Senator Manny Pacquiao "in aid of copation" in the alleged intimidated funds given to the POC of PSC, which is reaching 13.6 million from 2010 to this year.
Senator Pacquiao will be heard anymore, by the virtue of the filed resolution of Senator Sonny Angara, to be disqualified from ABAP President Ricky Vargas to run as an opponent of Peping Cojuangco in being led by POC.
Cojuangco is aspiring for his fourth term.
Angara says in the resolution of Angara, it is important to give clarity on the two issues because it is affected by the development of the Philippine sports which produces our "national pride, inspiration and instruments in the Nation-building."
In the opinion of Vargas's camp and when the majority did not have the reason to be disqualified from the ABAP president of the POC election committee, it is obvious that the incumbent President is on the side or side.
The POC Comelec argues that Vargas failed to answer the "Active membership" in the General Assembly meetings provision under POC by-laws.
One of the most important to wait is if the TRO will be put out (Temporary restraining Order) at the right time, timing on the day of election.
According to Vargas's lawyer, they need a TRO so that they will be able to know who is right or wrong.
It is also good to wait if this step of the camp of Vargas will lead to the sanction of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) like what happened to the Indian Olympic Association before because of the chaotic process of elections.
