Not everyone about a thing or a person is like it.
With fruits and vegetables, they have parts that we do not eat, the same with fish and meat.
Our husband also has a habit that we do not like but they are just giving up with them even if there is a corresponding punishment because of their sworn promises and signed contracts.
Our children have our attitude that we do not like, no choice, but accept their whole character because they are already released by their mother,.... it is impossible that they will return to her womb.
Even in our own personality, we also have characteristics that we do not like that's why we are envious of others.
For example, we do not want our nose to be flat so we are envious of someone who is based on a nose, our hint that we are envious of taller, etc.

Even in the town where we were born, there are things there that we do not want to go back, but because we need to put it back to the application and bio-data we cannot do anything but just write.
In religion, that is the same because there are catholics who want to go to church itself... they do not want to go to church itself... because it's a Catholic, no choice but to accept Father, because God might get mad.
At work is the same... the workplace example is that we do not want because there are many mosquitoes, and the boss is so bad that our attitude is ugly!... but we still have a choice because it is hard to find work today.

We do not want to make a curse but because he wants to lose the vices of drugs in the Philippines or even if it is less than a big, I will be okay with him.

As we live in the top of the world, we do not like 100%.
Sometimes, even God to do everything, we will be knocked on each other because of the calamities that happened.... and we are getting angry at him when the bad luck in our lives, together with the question of, "WHY me, lord"?
