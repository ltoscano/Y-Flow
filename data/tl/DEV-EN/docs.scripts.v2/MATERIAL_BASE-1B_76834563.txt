Paris attack in Philippines
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
The government and the people should not be relying on the threat of terrorism in any part of the Philippines.
It might be repeated, for example, the forehead is the same bombing of buses and different parts of Metro Manila and bombing in Light Railway Transit in Blumentritt, Manila.
As well as the bombing of a ship of Super Ferry 14 that the place where around 120 people died, including many students and teachers, outside Manila Bay while traveling the ship from Manila towards the Visayas and Mindanao.
The bombing of the said ship was the worst made of terrorists in all countries in South East Asia, especially in the ocean.
400 + dead in record from the year 2000 to 2007 only over 400 people died.
Maybe the number of those who are killed might be double if the victims of terrorism will be included in the year 2008 until now.
Included among the victims who kidnapped the ransom, those who are beheaded and being shot, especially in Mindanao.
If the tremendous fear of citizens and disappearance and destruction of livelihood and the future of thousands, but any million citizens, children of tokwa, terrorism is really serious.
That is why, until everyone can do it, the bombing and shooting of the terrorists should not be repeated.
And if you cannot stop it, a little and small are the victims of crooks.
They do not choose the soul because they are being victimized and they seem to be forced to ensure that they are innocent and innocent.
Do not deny the authorities, especially the military, who are not members or supporters of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, the encountered and killed in the fight in Mindanao in the past few days.
Among those who were killed were two Indonesian men who could have trainers "terrorists."
The flag of ISIS is allegedly being used by those who were killed to be confused by the authorities in the steps of those who were killed.
However, the citizens should not just believe in the statements of the authorities in the number of failed statements of them on the matter.
If it is not a failure, it is intended for a statement so that it will not alarm whoever has interest on the matter while there is a solution to the problem.
It is only then that they are telling the whole truth if the journalists and citizens who know about the events are being monitored, for example in the investigation of the Congress or the reports of the United Nations.
Americans, PRANSES, caution and cooperation against terrorists is really needed because of the existence of hundreds or thousands of foreign targets.
The foreign active in defending their "Mother organization" in other countries, like ISIS, is located in Iraq and Syria.
Americans, Pranses that killed 130 people in the Paris attack, Russell sold 240 people through the bombing of civilians in Egypt, Arab and others.
An example of a referendum to the foreigners, the bombing that happened in bali, Indonesia, which killed hundreds of foreigners and not Indonesian.
It ran and hid from my beloved Philippines is one of those who made a bombing in bali and nothing else but Marwan was the one who killed our Special Action Force 44 and wounded many other policemen of SAF.
A crowded place to remind the authorities, be careful in crowded places.
Because these kinds of places are the common target of terrorists, there are foreigners or not.
Malls, churches, fiasco, bus station, train, ships and airplanes themselves.
If these cannot be avoided, being observant, quick communication and strict cooperation with the authorities.
Remember this: The authorities cannot take care of the fight here.
They need the citizens not only in the actual struggle of tackling but also their intelligence before any attempt for terrorism, while this is happening and after the incident.
It is a good example of the Paris attack that everyone is active in following the footsteps of the terrorists from Paris, France up to the countries Germany, Belgium and others that were conducted after the arrest of the police conducting the said attack.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
