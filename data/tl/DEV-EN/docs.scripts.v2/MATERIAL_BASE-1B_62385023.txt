The government should quickly act on saving Filipinos from the Ebola virus disease in countries he has.
This should not be hesitant or consumed for a long time in making order to be saved from the 115 Philippine Contingent of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force who stations in Liberia.
Included in those who save this is a total of 4,200 Overseas Filipino Workers who can be found in the said country and the Sierra Leone and Gunia.
These countries, parekers, are being attacked by no medicines and deadly Ebola and the governments have declared that their situation is a national emergency that is their situation with the amount of dying of them.
The government of the Philippines should imitate the other countries who have their own citizens from the said countries before they get tired of those who are sick and die.
For many instances, always late, parasoy, the government of saving OFWs in the ongoing war in different countries until they are getting caught, including the government.
It can be considered as the same as the strength of the severe war that needs forcibly evacuations.
If the government is not quick to decide and take action, it is scary to think that it will only take action if someone was infected and killed by an OFW.
Like what happened after Libya was beheaded by a male OFW and to rape a Filipina nurse.
If the government does not act for it and the Philippine Contingent of OFWs and those who are infected with them, it is scary when they are divided.
It should be said that the government does not have any ability to fight Ebola.
Maybe it is possible that they are still pests.
Eric Tsailing when we were able to enter it.
He also does not have a clear program whatever he will do in case we have entered Ebola.
That is why, while there is still no bad news about the Filipinos related to Ebola, the government should take action.
Or take action, you are stupid.
Pwe!
