If there is nothing about it, all of us are involved.

Almost 2,000 years have passed when a group of people came closer to Jesus Christ, and there is an opportunity to try him and be put in shame, with the latest request for Him to show a sign to truth that he is the one he gives Him.
His reply, written in Matthew 16: 2-3, is not similar to what they expected.

Jesus is only good at many great miracles, and they have no trace of assumption that they were aware.
The evidence is there, but they are rejected to accept it.
That is why they called the right thing for them - hypocrites and deceitful people.
And he informed them the result of their lack of belief.
The lack of spiritual understanding, that Jesus Christ mentioned to them, they managed to blind to what they should see.
The proof of the weather is there, however, they opted not to deny it.
They continue to sleep, sleeping, and finger pointing to sleep.
Too blind, deaf, and pipi.
In spite of the scattered truths in their surroundings.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
What does not believe and lack of spiritual understanding can cause us to be blind to the dangers lurking?
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
The words of Jesus is meaningful for us this day?
What does not believe or lack of spiritual understanding is causing people - and even in the whole country - to be blind to the dangers that are clearly lurking and will happen?
Do we really care and allow the warning to face and give appropriate attention?
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Don't we have understanding that this will also happen to us?
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Let us notice what happened in Atimonan, Quezon, where thirteen (13) people were killed and deliberately suspicious of the murder.
There are many times that has been happening before, no longer count.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
It took more attention to the balana and has long been credited by the newspapers and sick with criticisms on radio and television.
However, nothing happened, like before, his mouth remains unfolded and the majority of our countrymen do not care about it until the violence in oblivion.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
What is really the deliberate?
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
What should I remember what I remember, especially in our time now?
Many checkpoints were filed in the roads and these are in the entire country, because of the upcoming elections this coming May.
The middle of the murder happened from those who dressed up checkpoints of the police and that.
How are we now sure that the ongoing murder will not happen again to us, when we are traveling on the road, and blocked by checkpoints of the police and members of the privilege?
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
The explanation of a police officer, if you don't have any fault and no weapon kept inside your car, nothing will happen to you.

We should not forget the Maguindanao massacre (Ampatuan massacre), where fifty-eight (58) people were murdered, and all four (34) here are Joe Manta and others are common people who lost their lives.

On November 23, 2009, She was in 2013, and there was no clear justice.
Why is it so much?
Because those who have faults are strong and will surely make a lot of votes in the coming election?
If this is not the reason, why is the trial slow?
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
If there are questions, it is better to have answers.
And if there is a slow effect, it is only proves that there is a reason that is happening here.
We're going to get a lot MORE.

If there will be no one to be seen and will dig up for our welfare, more than our safety, how can we ordinary citizens?
Let's remember that many are the ones who are taking advantage of the right to hold guns or be armed with us citizens to cide themselves.
And this is extremely rare, that the police, and private forces of politicians in the entire archipelago, and more who celebrate for this are the dangerous syndicates and criminals, because they are the only ones who have the right to use weapons.
