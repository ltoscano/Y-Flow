It is intentionally that there are officials of the government which are already peak, the socket of the thick face!
One of those, parekers, this is Cesar Villanueva, the chairman of the governments Commission for Government Owned and conversations Corporations.
It can be recalled that in the seat of PNoy, he was attacked by the GOC official in the administration of GMA like SSS, GSIS, PhilHealth.
According to PNoy in his first SONA, the said officials have a thick face because they were given huge bonus when the people are struggling.
So in 2011, PNoy appointed Villanueva to stop the said tonnes, but last week it was revealed by COA that the officials who were elected by PNoy will continue to steal from the said agencies.
As a matter of fact, the COA paid 2.13B that the inhumane!
This means, that Villanueva has not fulfilled his job as chairman of the governments Commission for GOC.
The thing is, instead of admitting his being stupid or if there is still a left shame on the body, he should just resign from his position, well, that is why the Animal will escape.
Just imagine, that GMA is still being blamed on the billion peso which is clearly seen in the administration of PNoy.
In the interview of the media, Villanueva's mouth almost rose from his mouth while he has made no choice because of the virtue of an order signed by GMA before he left.
King-ina!
If "GMA" signed the contract and appointment, PNoy dismissed it because it was "detrimental to the people!
Do not let them escape, greedy!
Pwe!
