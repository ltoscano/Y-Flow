Third regret
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
I hope I have done brave to express my feelings.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Most of them regret why they lost strength that their feelings are coming.
Many of them, just for not to be angry, forcing them to hide it and keep it to themselves.
They have more favored one mistake instead of standing up and fight for their principles.
They argued, "we should just follow the flow, so we should not be involved."
"What is the noise, then it is that it is dancing!"
However, in all of this, their conscience is an analysis of why they are carried by the flow and even the accomplices of the evil of others.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Always plead, blaming, complaining and escaping to avoid.
Why is the government blaming the government when he sold the vote?
Why are they complaining of the pile of garbage when they do not stop throwing anywhere?
Someone wants to do anything but do not want to meddle?

We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
As a result, they had a serious illness that has a relationship with anxieties, restrictions, and have added that they will not be able to recover.

Spin-up: Even at work, in terms of relationship, or even partner in business, we can decide that our tongue will bite than to express what's bothering our mind.
We quickly escaped from the situation so that they will not be involved.
We need to put our true personality more than those that we do not want.
Instead of being suffering, waiting for a good opportunity, let us not let the moments that we are not being able to express our love, compassion, and help because this is needed to treat each other.
Let us not take pictures and fear that we are dangerous.
We need to learn how to be awake in our emotions and to express this in accordance to help in a happy relationship.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
What is right, hide and hide what you feel, or express this to ease any commotion in the mind?
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
