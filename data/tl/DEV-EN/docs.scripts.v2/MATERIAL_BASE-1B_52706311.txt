We hope that our Philippine Navy will be a real army next year after the Department of National Defense announced a day of buying two sophisticated ships from the Italian.
These modern ships, Maestrale Class, frigate, has the ability to take a margin of both ships and lessen the airplane because of various weapons borders, including "the so-called surface-to-air and surface missiles, torpedo and automatic abortions.
It is more strong than the Hamilton Class cutters that were sold to us by the United States Coast Guard recently.
These ships were confiscated by the Italian for their army of sea in 1982 and will be porting by them in January next year.
Although it is important to P11.7 billion to second-hand ships, it will be a big help in reducing security in our ocean especially now that our relationship with the People's Republic of China is not good.
As an archipelago, it should have been strengthened by the government.
Our army is funny because our army is more stronger than the Navy and air force when the value of the last two forces mentioned.
It's because the government has given attention to the insurgency which is a result of poverty which is the greed of the "" politicism and businessmen. "
If before the path of our government is straight, we should not have an insurgency and we have a military force to respect our neighbors.

I wonder why the tricycle are allowed in our primary streets like Maharlika Highway.
Aside from the cause of the slow flow of traffic, it is very dangerous for passengers, drivers and the trian.
Aside from being rude to the majority of the refugees, it is slow to run, many of the motor vehicles are against mother-environment because they are extremely smoke.
It will add to the smoke of these from the water that is being stored by factories, empting buses and jeepneys.
The tricycle made the pollution and heat of the world or global warming.
We really live here in us "live and your own Risk" is not written (unwritten code) that follows everything.
