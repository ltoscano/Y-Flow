Yesterday, I thought of winning the "Pambansang Kamao" of the Philippines.
I thought that he would hope to recover from his severe defeat to Juan Manuel Marquez, who is one of the most difficult opponents.
Marquez, who is lucky to bring Pacquiao down in 2012 in the fourth round, gave the pain in the feelings and pride of the Filipinos who admire Pacquiao.
He said that he was shocked by the force of the country at that time and one of the fans lost faith in Pacquiao because of his involvement in a new religion, because he did not wear his rosary and because he did not do the former style where he defeated his opponents.

In his recovery in the severe heat, he defeated Brandon Rios who is also criticizing her.
And in the end, he also admitted that Pacquiao is really intense so in an article that I have read that Manny will win in the fight against Bradley.
Marquez, he does not want to fight Pacquiao so he wants Bradley to win so that they will still be the one who will fight and to recover from his defeat to Bradley.
Mayweather Junior, who is also one of those who does not want to fight Pacquiao, Bradley allegedly taught her how to defeat Pacquiao.

That is why when the fight has already started, each side will compete.
Within 12 rounds, Pacquiao is still aggressive because he is the only one to defeat Bradley because of the words he made for him (Bradley).
In this fight, it is as if I noticed that what Bradley said was not happened because he was really hard to beat Pacquiao because each of Pacquiao almost hit him.

I noticed that Bradley seems to use the style of Mayweather, which uses the size of his body, playing with Pacquiao and understanding.
But Pacquiao did not falter because if it broke out, he could be defeated and his popularity which could be a dealer in his medre-Reporting.
It has been several times that Pacquiao was hit with heavy punches but it is more buried in the end.
One of these is the consecutive punches (8 consecutive) that hit Bradley's face.
In one corner, the reaction of Pacquiao's mother was noticeable while watching the rosary and a libraries.
