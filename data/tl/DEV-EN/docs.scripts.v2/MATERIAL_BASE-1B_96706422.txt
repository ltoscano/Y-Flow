The BIFF did the statement following the hearings made by the Senate and the Chamber about the Mamasapano encounter that happened.
On January 25, more than 300 members of the PNP-Special Action Force attacked the hiding terrorist Zulkifli Bin Hir alias Marwan, where they were killed.
Despite this, 44 members of SAF were killed in the incident aside from his wounded personnel after the forces of the BIFF, Moro Islamic Freedom Fighter (MILF) and other armed groups in Barangay.

In the hearing in the Senate, Senator Alan Peter Cayetano first called the MILF and BIFF because of the brutal and inhumane killing of the police who served a warrant of arrest Marwan.
Despite this, BIFF spokesman Abu Misri Mama said in her interview with the Philippine Daily Inquirer that they are not terrorists and instead fighting for their rights.
Mama said, the troops of the SAF and the government of the United States are the real terrorists because of the attack on their land.
"We Are not terrorists.
We Are fighting a legitimate cause.
"The soldiers, SAF (Special Action Force) and the US government are the terrorists because they intrude into Our Land and want to take it away from US," he stated.
Mama's challenge to government officials, they also have weapons and go to Mindanao to fight them.
"If they really want war, Aquino and these politicians should bring guns in March to Maguindanao."
"They will come here, we will give them what they want.
"We will show them a real war that is Far different from what they See in the Movies," Mama said.
In a separate interview with Mama, he admitted that they held some things of the killed members of the SAF.
Contrary to what the MILF said for the side of the BIFF, Mama said that they have no plans to return the guns and other things that they took to the killed police.
Yesterday at the hearing in the Senate, MILF peace panel negotiator Sidagher Iqbal had attended the first time.
In his statement, Iqbal said that they were separated from the BIFF.
Although Iqbal admitted that some of their staff were involved in the encounter in Mamasapano, he said that a misencounter took place and insisted that the desire of the MILF continues to push the peace talks for Mindanao.-DCR.
