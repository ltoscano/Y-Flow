PW: What can you say about the call of Duterte to all-out war in the communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) / NPA?
Jaime "Ka Diego" Padilla: The Oscars of the past regime failed, from Oplan Lambat BITAG 1 to the current Oplan peace.
Not all-out war like the total war of Cory Aquino will solve the armed conflict of the country.
Duterte is just taking advantage of the earlier Presidents that will fail in their attempt to suppress the Spanish movement.
The armed army is always ready to face any lash of the state to fight for the rights of the citizens and fully fulfill a real, fair and lasting peace.
PW: Who will hit all-out war of President Duterte and operation of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP)?
JDP: Citizens are victims of all-out war of Duterte.
We are sure that human rights violations are increasing.
In fact, before the all-out war, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) launched operations in communities that cause violence.
PW: In your opinion, the government of the Philippines (GRP) plans to implement the Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for Human Rights and International humanitarian Law (Carhrihl) especially that Duterte stopped peace talks?
We're going to get a lot MORE.

JDP: The MORE than 400 political prisoners have been jailed.
He still has statements about the arrest of the Philippine National Democratic Front (NDF).
Melthis Glor Command- NPA Southern Tagalog is open to keep them with the members of the Duterte Negotiating panel during the time they will be sent to transactions.
This is part of the duty of the NPA as the armed army of the Spanish movement.
This is to ensure that the member of the NDFP panel will not be caught again so that they can still be caught by their own duties while there is no peace talks.
PW: Do you still want to pursue peace talks?
JDP: We still want to push the peace talks while there is a fight.
This is where we can ensure that our hands were not tied while the AFP launched the AFP to the Spanish base.
The peace talks can still continue to continue to discuss the problems of the armed conflict and answer the root of poverty in the country.
PW: What do you call for Duterte?
JDP: We call for Duterte to continue the peace talks to answer the five decades of fighting in the country.
As well, to see his sin-responsibility in the discussion, he needs to free the political prisoners as a duty in Carhrihl and make sure that Jasig will continue to protect the Malaysian Consulate.
PW: What do you call for the people?
JDP: The red mandering firm continues to push peace talks and join in the national issues.
Let us show the regime that poverty is still severe in the country.
They need to act and join their portrum to know the situation of the peace.
They can go near the Post headquarters of the NPA or leaving the masses to talk about the issue.
