"The intelligence, like the writer, is always (necessarily) public," said Prop.
Luis V. Teodoro, comprehensive intelligence and teacher of journalism, on his new essay "Writers and Public Intelltuals."
It was said to have read a lot of writing in his speech "Interpreting the World: The writer as Public Intelevtual" in the bloggers of the Philippines of le Pen (Poets, Playwrights, Essenists, and Novelists).
According to Teodoro, "not like Pilosyes This investigation, the intelligence could not be done in which he discovered and understood, let it be discovered by the future, when he did not let go of his duty to creating a future, that the foundation was to be helped by the present."
There is an exact meaning, however, the prashing "public intelligence" in the US, where it came from and met.
And he / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she /
According to scholar Russell Jacoby, who is one of those responsible for the creation of the prase, "means" the term] in general (roughly) of an intelligence community to discuss issues with general significance, a person who is writing not only for the professional journal but for the newspapers for all, "The Decline of American Intelltuals," 1989]. "
It is obviously the second share of the decade "80 written and published in the research of Jacoby, because it is still focused on the print like newspaper and salt.
In the continued spread of the television and after the Internet in the following decade, the "public intelligence" has been inclusion "by using these restrictions to send a wide public to the issues that they are involved in.
With other things, it cannot be avoided, it has also corresponsive as a "famous" or celebrity.
Based on the basis of this kind of meaning in "public intelligence," many can be determined in the country, both in Lewa, right and in the middle.
But there is a public intelligence that is meaningful to pay attention: To fight Axel Pinpin.
Interesante and useful to check what he is locked in as a public intelligence.
Many were identified by Pinpin who was included in the "Tagaytay 5," activists in South Katagalugan who was illegally arrested, martyur and then imprisoned for more than two years of the government.
After being freed, Pinpin continues to become a activists in South Dakota.
In the ranks of activists, Pinpin is known for a poem.
He was identified, perhaps more than the poem he was published and documentary, for poeters, rallies, night culture, awards, and others.
He was prominent and permanent included in the countries that launched the activists and the citizens of South Katagalugan, together with the organisation of the ranks, copra makers, and of course, diving in different stages.
He is like a special leader for activists.
She is my favorite to invite in different gatherings so that he will get away.
His reading, it is often welcoming the peace and at the end of the strong applause.
Many were being taken by a picture with him and there were witnesses who also witnessed him by some fans, even if not minor.
It is also my favorite to want and share, i-like and share, the poem on the internet.
The amount of poetry is invaluable, especially in the ranks of the masses.
"The theory," Karl Marx said, "is becoming a material force alongside his grip on the masses."
And with what Pinpin was doing, they were asked to come near and the comprehensive theory of the masses - in a manner of revelation, clearly, and it can be remembered.
There is a secret, because there are four of the issues and issues of the masses, at the time they are experiencing and at the time they are fighting in relation to it.
Pinpin's poem is effective about the restrictions of the state, for example, not only because they were excellent as a poem.
They are effective because they were reading in front of the filipino people who are fighting in the establishment, the demolition and even the dissolution of ranks in rally - and usually, at the time the wounds are still fresh.
He was being humiliated and it will take a while to heal the wound, and that is why he continues to fight.
Pinpin has already reached fame in the academic and supporting the duck duck; he has a poem on the MRT.
But it is not associated with the growing fear and doubt of the comprehensive arts art in the west where their work will be like an image of Che Guards - in many missiles, source of system, and there is no radical message, and there is no danger to the rules.
The centered critics of Terry Eagher then wrote: "There is a first understanding that he has to be sad and promote the American liberal and radical, because sore from the speed of the American liberal and radical, because her consciousness is sore from the speed that even the recent movement of art will be put in the entrance of the chemical Bank [The Sigurance of Theory, 1990]."
But it is not violations for Pinpin and his message is not growing up - and also not saying it.
The reason: He refused.
Eagher said, "if your most beloved leaving the art can be eaten by the system, this means one thing: Not in not enough to become a Filipino masses, but... they do not have the real root of the Filipino masses of political and constitutional...
The comprehensive director Lino Brocker said, he is not interested in creating the best Filipino films, but to creating the best Filipino viewers.
Pinpin, not only involved in creating best poem, but in extending the filipino masses.
He is not the only organisation of words, but the people.
He is not only fishing with metapora, they say, but the people are also fishing for change.
During the time of the insurer of the Philippines, in the decades "80, there are some who thought to plant armed men in the ranks of those who were armed.
Maybe, it is more dangerous in rules when in every act of the masses, people like Pinpin is planted.
Hopefully, thus, many activists, servants of arts and public intelligence, like Axel Pinpin!
