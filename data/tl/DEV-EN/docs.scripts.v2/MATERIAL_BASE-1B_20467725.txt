Witnesses: Hopefully, hopefully... By Jimmy Canton August 13, 2016 a good news was made by Hidilyn Diaz, who welcomed him on Thursday afternoon at the airport in his arrival from Rio de Janeiro.
Everyone thought that he will finish his joining the international competition after the silver medal last Sunday.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
But he said, he is ready to continue his career and join the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.
But before that, he will enjoy the P5 million reward and a house is a lot.
He plans to buy a vacant lot beside their house in Zamboanga and will let the youth in their area will be tested, which will be tested that brought him to success.
P5 million for his plan is lacking, but surely there are good people who will help to push through what he wants to happen.
Hopefully Diaz is not fed up in his difficult training so that he will join the Tokyo four years from now.
I remember what happened in 1996 when Only Velasco was home with a silver medal from the Atlanta Olympics.
She invited showbiz and because of her intelligence in comedy, she was given a Break.
The thing is, Only does not return to boxing.
The dynamics in showbiz liked to be far from the trend in boxing where he needs to wake up early to jog and training, where he needs to maintain his weight, where he needs to sacrifice every day.
Not long after, Only forget boxing and chose a colorful life in showbiz.
Sometimes, he got tired of boxing.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
IT was a shame, because that was just 21 years old and I hope IT was ripe for him to join the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
I hope that this is not what happens to Diaz, that would surely be the Athlete of the Year of the Philippine Sportswriters Association.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
