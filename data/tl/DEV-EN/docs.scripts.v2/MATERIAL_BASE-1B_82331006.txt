Just recently the annual PHIBroadway or the Amphibious Landing Exercise between the Marines, Filipino and Americans.
On October 18, 2012, their closing started on October 8.
In recent years, in various places in Luzon, the activities that are part of training were organized once again.
According to those who were caught, the training became successful because it became serious in humanitarian assistance and Disaster Response.
The PHIBroadway is apart because this is a combined exercise for the Marines of the Philippines and America and this year is the 29th series.
The exercise aims to map the ability of the two forces to be operated by a joint in front of any situation.
In this field, it can be seen in the entirety that we pay attention to the activities invested in humanitarian assistance and Disaster Response.
This is very important because we know that the disasters, particularly those from the ocean like typhoon, tsunami and earthquake, is the most dangerous threat "not only in our country but to others.
In these kinds of training, the joint forces will form the operations of the joint forces that they can use in the arrival of real opportunities.
That is why when any disaster comes, the two forces are ready to respond to other disasters.
Because of this, even if there is no place in the Philippines to do these joint training (when, and even if the activities that are mixed in exercises) two are the most important benefits achieved by the contestants - the interoperability or the ability to assist or face any situation, or for any situation.
