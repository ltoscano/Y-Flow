On June 29 to July 3, 2012, the Film Development Council of the Philippines was organized once again throughout the Philippines.
From the 120-funded description, you can choose 15 for the feature film - five in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao-to be named, and 10 are finished and shown in the festival.
One of the things I liked, but the other judges did not notice the Tamim.
It was revealed in the short story of Macario Tiu, this is about a teacher in elementary school with husband who is very whole.
A symbol of the powerful catholic Church and modernity, the teacher was worried about treatment of a shaft chapel.

In his anger, even the traditional destruction of the altar of the offer) was destroyed by the teacher.
When her husband had a problem in giving birth, and because of the heavy rainfall, the teacher was forced to go to the shaman.
The drinking is to heal because of his conversation with the old cell phone with Sir Sandpity, and it was found out that the Sir was angry because the teacher destroyed it.

Dancing to the teacher in the downpour of rain to remove the anger of Sir.
The movie is good, there is no more definition in the form but was able to ad a story from the region that is common, we cannot see in other movies.
Even in the current indie Cinema, only Sherad Anthony Sanchez, Teng Manganski, and Arnel Mardowned, is leading to sharing images and stories from the region.
I let them tell them the weight of revealing the story of you in Mindanao-Wan.

This is a unique movie of Oracle, together with three more films from Mindanao batch of the first inning Pambansa - because of the influx of stories from the most under-represented region in the boom of indie Cinema.

However, there are two issues that should be considered in the movie contestants in the Batasang Pambansa.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
First, the search and use of material from the region as an impetus to the aim of the movie.
In the case of Tamim, it came from a duck enclosure from the writer of the region, and the author needs to transform the audiovisual media.

The ability of the film is its capacity to create an ambitious space which is familiar is not familiar.
Or in the case of under-represented heels, the unfamiliar story is being made.

Although the location, a person, and courted, in the actual region, what will be thought will be the province of Rizal, Nueva Ecija or Quezon.
The quality is not unique - the visibility - and so, the intrusive material in the media of the movie is not unique.
The particular request for non-Metro Manila story and movie is to make the audiovising material.

It is not at the level of exhibition that is like a tarta of the Department of Tourism but at the level of etnograph space.
What I am thinking about here is the audiovisors of the former Davao airport in the movie of Sanchez and Robin Fargo, Baltimore (2010) that has a hint of contrast to the inequality and coming-out.

The wing issue is the text of the movie.
Tammy was absolutely dependent on the Tiu's story, it is not absolutely effective in the media of the film the three dimensic opportunities of staff (biolohires, and social media), and like the said familiarity of the unfamiliar location and tags of the story.

The second issue is about the lack of transfer of knowledge in the area, and most of all, to the staff that is being provided by the film.
If this is a movie she found in Metro Manila, many givens that do not need to be discussed.
But because this is an emotional film, many givens are needed to lay out by the filmmaker: Your relationship with foreign teachers and indigenous people, pregnancy as a person in remote areas, and others.

In the film, the treatment of the diegesis is also a foreigner who missed the development of diegesis that miss the social and subscription motivation for domestic relationships in the movie.

IT needs, however, for most studies in the community to suggest the integral motivation to the movie, especially if IT comes from the region.

It should be considered that the media of the movie is focused towards the feature of the situation that will build all the elements of the scene he had to write to the filmmaker.
If there is no absolute disruption, there is absolutely no former climax, and it is sad to say, of a total movie.

The potential is not an analysis, and this is the first danger of the emotional filmmaker (patience) which is an absolute appropriate term): There is a higher education and schemes for details of the participants.
That is why it is included and screaming to the national hero (national Cinema) because this is the one that is not being served in the dynamics of making movies in the country.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Before we can make a movie, it is time to study the society taking advantage of the story of the movie.
In other words, we can stop and study the society.
