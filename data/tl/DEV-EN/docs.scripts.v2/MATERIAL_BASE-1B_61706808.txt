CIDG raid the warehouse owned by rice... Amen - because finally, the PNoy administration woke up with what is happening like this.
And the raid, headline in all news because he led no other but DILG Secretary.
Mar Roxas and Secretary.
Francis "Kiko" Pangilinan.
There are a lot of people discovered by the two secretaries - aside from rice cakes, the rice stored in rice stored in the storage.
One of the missiles are called "exchange" scheme.
These are NFA rice to be transferred to other sacks to make it look like a good kind of rice.
He is able to release it or other good types of rice if this will be bought from commercial Retail outlet, like market.
We are the buyers, it is delicious for us to buy, but the truth is, what we are eating is NFA rice.
But the most bad deeds of the warehouse owner or rice hoarder is the way feeding us with dirty and damaged rice.
We saw in the TV report the mixture of rice that was caused by cleaning, being sold to us by rice hoarder.
If you think about it, the amount of rice is cheap, but because of rice grains, there is a rice shortage, which is why the price of rice is a masterpiece.
We will be united, this is the content of the upcoming SONA of PNoy.
Hopefully, these raids will not be good.
Hopefully the Aquino administration should be true.
