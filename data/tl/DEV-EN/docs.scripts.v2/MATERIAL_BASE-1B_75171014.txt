I do not personally, because those are the political activity I have.
They can only see that it is personal cricket because I use a poem.
But I am not rich for myself.
This poem is part of the work suggesting, political activities, activism.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
That is their accusations, accusations or comments, or perhaps always seeing me.
That my poem is personal cricket, which is as if he is not a political role.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Yes, I have personal poets, who agree with the topic of love, but the majority of political parties, who join the subject of society, poverty, struggle, women, revolution, dukha, uring workers, rotten system, and get the opportunity to change.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
The appearance is probably the personal, because I make IT easier to transform the comments on different issues, including belief, principle that I am ashamed of.
Which is usually a poem, critic and measurement, that for others, it is hard to do so they just settle for free speech in English or free verse in English).
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Maybe it's probably personal because that is what I chose to use.
But the content is political because I would like to share the comments I commented on a business business, including the corresponding principle and celebrate that I want to hug the aspiring for change.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
What he sees is form and not the content.
But if they just reading it, it is not the form that will resonate in their spirit but what is stated in the poem.
In Response to bread that is beautiful, they will only blossom if it is delicious or useful when it is eaten.
Like a poem, we should just look at the form but we also have the depths of it, in order to expect if it is astonishing or delicious for a poem.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
A poem is suggesting.
The call to change to cure the poverty of majority citizens is a duty that is hard to fulfill but needed.
Hard work and intellect is needed so that they will have resources to change the needs of unity to change the system of society, to change the tools of the production, to change the relationship of the people without taking advantage and not being raped.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
I will continue to poem on the ankle because I will continue the kind of form of Balagtas and Batute, to protest the masses and batters in playing words.
Balagtas, will explode with a long poem Florante and Laura, and Batute, will explode with a long poem in the East.
It's just two fiction and can report to anyone who will be able to read this from their duties to the people.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
I dream to make a poem like this and Batute, a poem too long, but joined the topic in history and struggle of the workers.
I think, when I managed it and published, I could die happy.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
