Call to President Duterte By Jeany Lacorte November 4, 2016 I do believe in the escalation of the campaign against illegal drugs by our President Rodrigo Duterte with the Philippine National Police (PNP) and even the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).
In fact, the support of the campaign against illegal drugs of the Duterte government is really strong because even some private sector and non-government organizations (NGOs) are still working.
But despite the success of the Duterte administration in the campaign against illegal drugs, the problem in criminality is covered.
Because of the intensified campaign against illegal drugs, there are many more serious crimes that are really saddened by our countrymen because it seems that the government is not able to focus on the war against illegal drugs.
Just like a call on Facebook of a Luz Sarmiento Leonerio who is a native of Zambales.
Here is the overall call of netizens as Miss Luz.
"Nananawgan is the president to do not use drugs to be killed just because of a hold-up and one of the close to our family was the hold-up like a chicken that was killed.
D lour cteacher in the town of others and the town of Botolan that happened in the entire Zambales.
D only is the widespread in our country.
Because no matter what to do and kill the most brain, they will stop.
The hold-up is already spreading that is why it is just a problem if you love the people in the country and you will buy the police to take care of the people.
"I thank you!!!!"
This is only one of what I know that many call to be watched on social media every day that the president and the PNP will be given attention because it is pitiful for the victims of criminals who are taking advantage of the busy government against illegal drugs.
