But hopefully this is not the reason of the case filed by Manila Vice Mayor Maria Shiela "Honey" Lacfirst-Pangan against the group of majority floor leader Councilor Casey Sison together with 17 councilor of Manila.
VM Honey filed a petition to stop the implementation of P14-billion city budget for 2017 after it was discovered that the budget of his office was released.

Anyway, hopefully the city council would realize that while they are in chaos, there are people or groups that are happy.
