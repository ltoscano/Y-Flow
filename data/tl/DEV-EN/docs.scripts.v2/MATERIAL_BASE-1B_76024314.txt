It seems that the people seem to forget the importance of the lessons of the EDSA People Power Revolution which happened on February 23-25, 1986.
It was three days that moved to the consciousness of the whole world when the dictator, former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, who was initially appointed to the citizenship for 20 years using the iron fist.
Because of the help and unity of the citizens, it was managed to be possible that it was impossible to kick out the dictator from power.
But 28 years have passed after that incident, Filipinos seem to have no ego that became a good result of the historic event.
Since then, until this time of President Noynoy, the country has already been the country and not count the elections, but the people are still in poverty.
Back to normal and when corruption in different branches of the government and the evil spirits and behavior that we turned away before will come back and seems to be worse now than before.
It is really a waste because we have not used that opportunity brought by the people power so that our country has been locked in poverty and chaos in our country.
After we were happy to go away, we went back to his old practice and forget the word help and unity.
So the result is that we seem to be ashamed to commemorate and celebrate like before the historic event and admits even the government here.
Another sad thing is that we also do not share the importance of events, because we do not show any good fruit that we can pride in them.
The inheritance of EDSA 1 is really a waste because the Philippines has not been a good model in the world even if the country has not been measured.
Just this Sunday, the Ukrainian President, Viktor Yanukovych, has once again imitate their President Viktor Yanukovych, because of the allegation of corruption and lack of ability to manage the government.
This is just a proof that even if the spirit of EDSA 1 is gone in the Philippines, it is still alive in other countries who are also dreaming of change.
That is the only thing we have forgotten EDSA 1!
