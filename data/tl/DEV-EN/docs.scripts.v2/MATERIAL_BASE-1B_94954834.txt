The contribution was only small so they were sent home.

We're going to get a lot MORE.
Four wins in a lot of games.
Despite this, the TNT Katfriends changed and sent home to Mario!
Where can you see that?
Isn't it easy?
Other teams were able to hit and have a hard time to rise in the standings but still not changing the import.
But the Tropang Texters are in a different class!
They are really decided to succeed in the Governors Cup.
Because coach Joseph USC thinks that the TNT Katfriends will not be brought to the finals.
The import might only be until the start when you are predictable!
Because, he is the one who has the most low-average of ten imports playing in the championship.
He is also not powering as a bounder.
But the TNT Katz wins in the first four games, isn't it?
This success is due to the locals.
Then, he honors as a player of the Game of Jayson Castro.
IT's "almost double the numbers."
Castro is less than a little bit more but he was able to domed the game.
And if the situation is titled, the presumption of USC and the coaching staff of TNT Katfriends is surely right.
So IT took Mychal Ammons to debut in the game against Blackwater Elite in Saado.
Well, at the beginning of the game, the Tropang Texters caught the Elite.
Blackwater will only stay in halftime.
But this is a result of the incident that Ammons had to adjust and Castro did not play first.
But in the Second half he went to Catsro and the game of Ammons, that is why the Blackwater will be crushed, 109-89 to remain clean the record 5-0.
The Tropang Texters are now alone in the top of the standings after losing the Mahmoud in Phoenix last Friday.
And USC does not regret the exchange done.
Because he sees Ammons with a good future to make 16 points and beheading 18 rebounds against the Elite.
Hopefully, this is not really regret for the TNT Katfriends because they have sent it home.
