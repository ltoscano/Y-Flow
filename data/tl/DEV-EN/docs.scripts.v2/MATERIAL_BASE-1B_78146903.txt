Alcohol and cigarettes!
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We remember a lot of things that we remember while fighting against the senators, congressmen and supporters of the Palace about alcohol and Mary.
Every summer, when you travel the damn from La Union to Ilocos Norte, I almost keep on seeing the crops of farmers.
Then I've made a lot of rice in This season.
You will also earn those who will run in Cagayan and Isabela.
And in Cordillera, there are also many who plant things.
I really have a big livelihood.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
If it is summer when I talks and rice, it is obvious how high the boxes of beer in the side of the house of the farmers.
There are also many scattered bottles of long pink, width and others.
There are also many scattered everywhere.
In the various stores, as much as the snack, twenty and soap is the number of cigarettes and alcohol products.
This is even if there are those who die and make it because of alcohol and Mary.
Even if someone dies from alcohol and cigarettes.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We have noticed something, patron.
I have a lot of Work and alcohol without tax.
There is usually no tax on the neb that I have been planted and being harvested.
Ah, those who are banking, coconut and based, usually no tax.
Then you buy the tags of factories, alcohol and wwsing if there is an occasion like berdey and spy on the Palace, when those in Congress and the Palace have a war, when those in Congress and the Palace have a war, you will just laugh while those in Congress and the Palace are laughing.
Just laugh at the growing metres of lamb, coconut wine, based and dry alcohol from rice.
Life is mysterious in alcohol and Mary.
Most of all, those who are chasing here are fighting, especially those who depend on pork barrel from taxes on vices.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
