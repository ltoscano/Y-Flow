Two weeks only?

Land Transportation is now in a hot seat at the Regulatory Board Chairman, Atty.
Ginez himself, due to severe traffic this past few days which paralyzed Metro Manila.
The LTFRB received various criticism.
Even those who should be together with the agency, he also said that he also said that he also had a fight against the LTFRB.
No one is tired of answering Chairman Ginez himself on the other hand, blaming him.
It is hard for critics to listen to the explanation of the critics, especially in the situation where the LTFRB is located, with severe traffic and many directly affected.
But let us also force to listen to the plan of the LTFRB and the answer of Chairman Ginez himself in criticizing her.
In fixing the traffic problem, not only one side should listen.
In the case of the same amount of Permits for the cargo trucks, we need to grant the request of all the stakeholders to give a permit to the trucks while they are waiting for their permit from the LTFRB.
It cannot be allowed to stop the travel of trucks that bring all the businesses of the country.
The economy will be affected if we insist on the immediate implementation so Ginez was asking for time.
The deadline is on Aug.
29 and after that, there was no extension.
The law is strictly implemented - the colorum and out of line will be arrested and penalized.
Consideration is what Chairman is asking for the extension until August 29 so that the action of business will not be stopped and the economy of the country will not be stopped.
Ginez's position is not easy.
It is not a joke that more than two thousand pesos of trucks needed to apply for permit to legal travel.
A number of years have been a problem for trucks in our roads, what is the additional two weeks.
Some of Europe said that will be quick.
The answer of Chairman - "we will look for the right solution because that the LTFRB will consider the interest of all.
