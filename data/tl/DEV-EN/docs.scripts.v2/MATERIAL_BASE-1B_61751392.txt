But why is Dimzon considered a winner and our OFWs may not be a loser if they went to the musicians?
Even if he failed to go abroad, the employers were oppressed, not fed and random abuse, when they went to the FWRC of our OFWs, while they are taking the required documents for their return, they are preparing for their return to the country.
They are teaching livelihood, living in order to add knowledge, so even if they are still abroad, they will be able to decide on what can profit from the Philippines.
Through this, they may not consider the again abroad.
