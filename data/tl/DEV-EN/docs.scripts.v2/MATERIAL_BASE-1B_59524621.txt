Call for youth on Independence Day
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Kalakhan to us, there is no innocent or not yet alive during the time of the base military of the United States in the Philippines.
We did not see the American soldiers who are parked in Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Complex.
We are not about to witness how our country will be placed in danger of the discretion of the United States in Vietnam and Korea.
It was reported that America has hidden weapons in our country before.
But we were able to catch the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) and Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) for the force to force them to force the Americans to be based in the country.
We saw the Chinese presence in the islands of Independence (Spring Islands) and Bajo de Massimo (Scarborough Shoal).
We saw how America and China are hostile to control the South China Sea or West Philippine Sea and entering their big warship in our ocean.
The display of China's display on the island of Independence is also clear in the construction of facilities in the islands.
The Filipinos will not be able to fish in our ocean because of the threats of the Chinese.
And don't forget the destruction of our national wealth to the Tubbataha in Palawan last 2013 because of the implementation of the USS Guardian that has hit almost 4,000 square meters of garbage.
There is also the disposal of a poisonous chemical in our sea and violation of the rights of the people every time the annual Balikatan military exercises.
At the time that our national Independence will be put in danger because of the entry of foreigners, it is our duty as the people standing up and defend the country from invasion and violation of our freedom and sovereignty.
The movement of the people in the early part of the decade "90 is staying at the base of America in our country and we continue to objected to the VFA and EDCA.
We will not allow the headquarters of their weapon and force to launch a war in Asia-Ocean.
We also do not make the discretion of China in our territory.
The Philippines is for Filipinos and never for any foreigners.
It is called time for the youth and people who have love and concern for the If Bayan.
To defend his wealth and nature, his freedom and Independence from foreign corruption and destruction behind.
The role of the youth is important for our call and fight.
The young age is not a hindrance in the national release like our heroes, Andres Bonifacio and Emilio Jacinto, who are all in their youth when launching a revolution against Spanish.
That's why it is better for us to go and take action this 12 June in the embassy of China in Makati and the United States in Manila.
Show our unity in fighting for foreigners and insist on our Independence.
Take IT in the upcoming Independence referendum.
Joined with the vast ranks of the Filipinos who celebrate patriotic and insist on the national sovereignty and integrity in the territory.
No one else will defend our country but his citizens.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
