Everyone is ready to everyone, they say.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
It is now ready for all the need to do by our government for the upcoming return of students in school.
The rooms Are ready for books, table and chairs of students.
The police said, they are also ready that is why they will also distribute civilian police.
This is one of their readiness to give protection to the students against the ogists of society like the robbers that's why the police can take advantage of passengers.
In Metro Manila, of course, the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is not left behind, so their personnel are already ready to ensure the light flow of traffic.
MMDA added, the so-called Pumping Station in the entire Manila is also ready to avoid flood from our countrymen during the rainy season.
In other words, if all the statements of various government agencies will be based, the opening of schools will surely be fixed in the coming June.
All of them are ready.
All of them have their own gimmick to the public as a sign of their readiness.
So if we are going to make sure we will just get hurt in these statements.
I will drag the house of my neighbor's house!
In the opening of schools in the whole country, there is the lack of rooms, chairs, table and books.
In the return of the students in the school, especially in public schools, it is certain that there are those who are missing the names list or the calendar of the list because it was destroyed.
Entering the month of June... it is certain that the flow of traffic is tight and when the strong rain comes, our students will surely walk in flood especially in Manila.
How many students can be tasted the ferocity of society such as robbers, isser and other modus?
Let us just say that... where are the police?!
Under the bridge, go through the bridge!
I even have a lot of roads than what is a big shortage of classrooms.
A bigger fund has been used for breakfast by government offices rather than funding for books, table and chairs.
In your opinion, the people?
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
