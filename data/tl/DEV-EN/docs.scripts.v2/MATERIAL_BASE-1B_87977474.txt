NCAA all-Star Game: Free for all in the 3-point shootout By Elech Dlacier August 12, 2016, Rey Nambatac will lead the West against the East in the NCAA all-Star Game in The Arena in San Juan later.
But the bet of Leicester, Nambatac, will maintain the crown of a three-point shootout in their school.
The throne was vacancy because the won last year, Mark Cruz of Letran, is now playing in the PBA.
5-foot-11 Namibac is the fight of Knights to stay for the title in Letran but she will surely be freed from last year's copner-up Wilson Baltazar of Lyceum.
All those who have tried in the outside of arc are the other contestants, AC Soberano of San Beda, Zach Nicholls of Aston, Carlo Young of Benilde, Jervin Guzman of EAC, RK Ilagan of San Sebastian, McKevin Velasquez of Perpetual, Exeqa Biteng of Mapua and Paolo Evardo of JRU.
Nambatac in the West are fellow Knights McJour Luib and Jomari Solplans, Darell Menina, Andrew Estrella and Exe Biteng of Mapua, Ian Alban, MJ Ajay and Wilson Baltazar of Lyceum of the Philippines, Joint Morada, Francis Munich and Sidney Onwubere of EAC and JJ Domingo, Yankie Harfirst and Christian Fajarthis of Benilde.
Panargo of the team East is Jio Jalwaves of Aston together with teammate Kent Salado, Bright Akhuetie of Perpetual, Davon Potts, Dan Sara and Donald Tankoua of Beda and Teyneth Teodoro and Paolo Pontequila of JRU.
