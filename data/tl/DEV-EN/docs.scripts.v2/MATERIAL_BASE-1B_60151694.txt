Alopecia 3 By George Nava-TRUE II August 26, 2016 Ito the last part of my answer to John L. of Negros Occidental, a 38-year-old Marino, who has an alecia areata where he describes his hair.
Yesterday I discussed the alecia and its causes.
Now, let us discuss how to be treated.
I am saddened to say that there is no cure for the alecia arean but it can lessen the worsening of its lost hair.
The hair will usually cough up after a year that is why others just neglect it.
To improve the appearance, you can wear a wig that made your real hair or call hair.
This can be compared to anit through glue, clips or tape.
Do not conduct hair weaving (throwing hair in a appointed hair in anit) because you are bald especially.
Also be careful in using perms or dyes because it can be cooked for a while.
The common medication in alopecia is the connection to the anit of corticosoids.
This is done every 4 or 6 weeks.
It will also help a child or old to cut it on the anit.
Because your anonymity and you have an Eclipse, you might Contact chemotherapy done by the derma to you.
It creates an allergic reaction after putting the medicine on the anit once a week.
It's people's issues and blossom if it seems like there is a trace but it is helping to cough up the hair for 3 months.
Some of these effects are severe redness of anit and inflammation of the neck.
Another medicine is sored with an ultra A light (whites) therapy.
This is used when a large part of the body is affected by the alecia and cannot use other medicines.
Consult a good dermatologist to help you.
The derma collected money and you will find a cheap and good service to the government Hospitals.
