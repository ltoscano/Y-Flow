It is important to follow the same standard of cut and uniform are important for a military unit so that this is to maintain a unique unit pride, disciplinary standard, and comradeship of the troops.

Since serving the Philippine Army in 1897, the regulations are slowly written like the right-cut and uniform.

The American soldiers knocked on the level of discipline military when the USAFFE was born before the second civil war.
The training of the soldiers continue to continue in the right discipline when the war is finished but the soldiers immediately put up in war on the geriloHuk in the 1950s.

In the 1950s, the soldiers Scout rangers were allowed to make their hair and hitter the bandits because of them, the sensitive mission is being searched by the bandits and the killing of its leaders.
In fact, the Museum of Msburgt Francisco Camacho Chinl Weenee Martillana made the murder of the terror leader of the bandit Huk, Eddie Villapando, because they have put their hair and pretended to be civilians while on the mission.

The Scout rangers also used to make the hair back in the 1970s and 1980s because of the 'special' mission where they can compete with ordinary people in the government to be found.

For me, the discipline of the soldiers should be distributed again like the proper appearance of a professional soldier.
First, the use of extending the hair is missing while on the mission because of the experiences of enemies in the tactic of going to war with soldiers in the past few seasons.
For example, the mission of the Museum is' Strike mission '(direct action mission) and is not the same with the Special Forces who are living in the government and organised by CHDF or CAFGU to defend people from the bandits.
It's just a Common sense that the Special Forces will just be seen with those who lose their acceptance of them.
Those who are killed in the culture of Filipino Muslims can register by bigote so it is also practical to imitate their appearance as agreement to their culture.

Second, even if the hair of the soldiers can be seen, they do not know how to talk about the words of our countrymen in the area.
Extending the hair or bigote is more unlikely to be useful if the bandits have already learned other words and countersigns.
Now, the stories of going to war is now on the internet now, including the insurgency warfare.

Third, everyone should heed what is stated in the AFP Transformation Roadmap where the administration desires to 'adopted and proud of the Filipinos'.
Who is a good Filipino for proud of the American soldier who is the bandits Abu Sayyaf or NPA?

Fourth, the good leader should have a broad perspective and learn from the experiences.
Sometimes, you cannot identify who is the soldier or bandits in the encounter if they mix up the different units.
This is my bitter experience when I talked to the students of SR Class 145 who were encountered by the bandits Abu Sayyaf in Tuburan, Basilan last year 2002.

Finally, there is no direct connection between the hair and courage.
When I was a Tennis, I completed the group of soldiers who do not want to get hurt and I headed as the spearhead of the operations against Abu Sayyaf.
In the fight, I can see the 'warrior' tree or a coconut tree.
It also did not last long, you want to get some of the bandits.
That's just a form.
As of now, my opinion to those who take care of hair is fabulous and just form this familiar story.

Therefore, I Can't agree with your crooked beliefs and arguments about pushing the bandits.
If you force you, volunteer immediately be an assault element always on your unit.
It will be better if you will be a leader, beside the fight and I will be about to be the 'warrior' based on your appearance.
