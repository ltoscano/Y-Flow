The Philippine Moms for Medical marijuana (PMMM) Founder Kathleen Kim has explained that their advocacy for supporting the use of marijuana for his medications that virtually does not deserve to legalize cannabis but should be focused on each other in order to ease their suffering from their proper medical, particularly those who suffer from epilepsy.
"The time is meaningful because there is a increase in the number of patients with medical problems that may be treated and reducing marijuana," Kim confessed.
