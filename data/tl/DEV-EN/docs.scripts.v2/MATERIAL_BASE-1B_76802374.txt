Uy, thank you for a long time because we have not learned a long time because I have not learned anything.
There are also a lot of changes happening here in the Philippines, while we continue to launch, the programs for progress here are being implemented.
Yes, only one of the Philippines, maybe I are seeing how I are doing is Pretty ah, I know that we are going to continue like what you have mentioned is that I am going to increase my money door to our country, our country and wanting a little rip for cancer.

For the three hundred thousand.
It is a ranting program that is also very torn but we will be able to implement all over the Country there is to ease the country's ttt; htt; twelve things from my father.
A few more, even if Glenda is fabricated.
And that's what we say, ttt; httt; htt; htt; in Indonesia, for them to be prepared for the work of our Philippines if they have been needed, of course, their cooperation and concern for the dangerous design.

Plant coconuts in their vacant lands.
Ha, many want the intelligence system.
They will plant instead of giving them a lot.
Crops that they can put in their plantation.
What should I say in incentives, we give the Coconut farmers in planting their own coconuts in their backyard.

Ha, if this is a strong creature, we have already done four so that it is easier to go with it.
You won't wait for a long time; it is only six months only.
We can pay for it.
Ah, if there is a limit on the foot, that is why it is within five months.
We can pay forty pesos for every dozen.
A tree to tell.
Not less than one year they will get an hour of four thousand to one hectares.
Profit is good and many are interested in north to South.
Why are you in Cagayan to Ilocos.
In Pampanga that it is not a previous rating of the grove area, we have a program that planting one million Coconut tree.
I still love a spare money so that she went through Communication there with my wife orio yes, it was said to me before the administrator of my grandmother because she had a lot of enthusiasm in cooperation with the advocacy of thread, ate ate ate in 'yo ha.
I don't know and take care of me before I get him, they took the plant of cap Coconut.
Yes, we really see the sustainable growth of the Coconut industry there in Pampanga.
Because it is more beautiful to say because it is closer to Recto Manila.
But Shaina previously said when you are going to take back in the part of Pampanga, do you think that it is no full of coconuts in the first part, we will taste it because it's just hormones to endure the delicious Coconut juice.
It is a mystery that is why I am also surprised that I am not there anymore.
Yes, there is one of the most delicious Coconut juice that we tasted by ltt; few in Pampanga that's why we can see and see nothing.
Why did we not stay here in the picture of Pampanga.

Ah, they are not able to beat them as a colony and he said, ah, it is not for Pampanga that he is always targeted to fall here in the favorite city to five more of Tarlac, they will just use it in the postal area but what's good here is that they spread the construction.

That is in love.
