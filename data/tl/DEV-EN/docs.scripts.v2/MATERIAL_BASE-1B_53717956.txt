So many reports in AlDub Nation, I will just widen a little.
At first I watch Alford, like you, I said to myself, fame is a different kind of fame.
It is not expected, not imagined, accident, just happened.
But I do not believe that all of these just appeared, from where, like no one came from, especially in the case of Yaya Dub, Maine Mendoza.
I have read a book that the title is the Outliers.
The point of the book is the arrival of the right time for something.
The book said: 'You need to spend and least 10,000 hours a thing you want before you become an expert on that matter.
For example, the book says, the Beatles or Justin Bieber - the story has been overnight.
But what many don't know, they have made it a lot of years for their craft before they became famous.
In the case of Yaya Dub, Maine is still young, where he is "dubbed" he is.
I thought, what was the comments of Maine Mendoza about what he did on YouTube since then.
Yaya Dub has not been easy with the parents of Yaya Dub to understand what kind of craft that he chose - but we look at what we've achieved today, right!
But it is not "overnight" ation.
Maine Mendoza made the "dubsmash" within a long time.
What might have been "overnight" is the vetting of Alden Richards.
My point is that this is the message for anyone whose popularity or success in the modern field is not really "overnight" but as a result of a long time of preparation and waiting at the right time.
Mark Zuccberg, for example, is the founder of Facebook, from a young boy, he has already described his ability to computer and coined people.
His success happened when he was already in College, after a long time of inactive experts in the field he was exhibited at 0g via email to 09178295982 or 09353885pm.
