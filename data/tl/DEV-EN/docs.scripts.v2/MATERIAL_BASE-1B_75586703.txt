Do you remember the golden Alli?
In my old age, the memory of golden Always is still clear.
This is the time when the Philippines is in Asia in the field of sports.
At the time he became famous like Lydia de Vega, Elma Motherwell and many others who gave honor to the country.
The tactic was simple before the golden Always.
Cultivate the sports where the country has a potential and found out that the athletes will find a medal in the country with national competition.
But it has been a long time.
The athletes have long been retired because of golden Always.
The Philippines has long gone away from the principle of golden Alli for a simple reason.
This is a result of the inedent during the time of former President Ferdinand Marcos.
Because the beauty of the principle of golden Alli was not seen.
The only thing he saw was who thought or perpetrators.
The golden Alli is a program before in Christmas season.
Invest and pay attention to the program to succeed.

We're going to get a lot MORE.
But now the Philippine sports is only depending on "ambon" which comes from the private sector.
It served as a shadow of the government and the leading commentator is the big companies that have personal and own interests that are for people.
It is not bad to help the private sector.
But the bundle of responsibility should be in the government.
For now, the government funds are only small in sports.
A world Class facility cannot register a lot to other countries.
Even the turnover of athletes are not good so long before seeing potential athletes.
The result of all the itants will continue to decrease the Philippines in the field of sports.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
