Demonstrations throughout the Philippines (AFP) protested the request of the Laude family to face the suspect, US Marine PFC Joseph Scott Pemberton.
This is after the American soldier did not show up with two preliminary investigation of the murder case filed by the relatives of transgender Jennifer Laude.
The AFP said, it is not possible that the family of the family based on the provisions of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) said that Pemberton was still in the US.
The family should write the US embassy and the Department of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines.
"Such is a matter of Our control," a statement to the midson of Lt. Col. Harold Earlier, public affairs chief of AFP.
In the second preliminary investigation, the lawyer of Pemberton failed to submit the counter-affidavit.
Rowena Flores, lawyer of Pemberton, asked the prosecutor's investigation to dismiss the complaint of murder because he has no basis.
If the case will move forward, it should be made as homicide and not murder.
But State Prosecutor Katie Fe delos Santos answered that the camp of Pemberton should not lead to the investigation.
"We will rule on probable cause after we complete the Process.
Don't teach US what to do.
"The bottom line is we will go on with the preliminary investigation," said delos Santos.
The Laude family is disappointed with Pemberton the investigation.
It is not sure that the suspect is in Camp Aguinaldo.
"What kind of government we have?
Marc (Sueselbeck), they were charged (permitted by AFP to "undesirable alien") but here, his case is in the future.
But why is Pemberton not facing? "Asked Marilou Laude, sister of Jennifer.
The family united with the Aquino administration because of the lack of interest in the case of their relative.
"Isn't it that you said that your boss is small?
Where is your straight path?
"Up to words," said Julita Laude, mother of Jennifer regarding President Aquino.
Harry Roque, acting lawyer of the family, said that it was not similar to the rape of "Nicole" in 2005 to submit a counter-narrative and posting photos of the accused, up to the present, there is still no statement and picture of the suspect Pemberton.
"Like what I said before, they will not reflect Pemberton," Roque said.
We're going to get a lot MORE.

Roque believes that the VFA will protect the suspect as an American soldier.
Because even the motion of Roque is that the DNA sample and fingerprints were taken from Pemberton, his lawyers protested.
For the group of women Gabriela who protested near the Justice Hall in Olongapo City, the declaration of "undesirable alien" is Pemberton.
"This declaration is useless under the VFA that allows the American soldiers to release the country even if there is no visa or any documentary," said Joms Salvador, general secretary of Gabriela.
The group is doubting, there is no way for the office of the immigration of the Philippines to watch the American soldiers who are joining the military exercises.
