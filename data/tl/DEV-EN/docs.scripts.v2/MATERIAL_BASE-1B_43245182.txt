My name is Rosalie Cruz, and as a nurse who is assigned here, I am tasked to know the situation, beat the heart, breathing and some questions about their illness before they check the doctor.
I was about eight patients, when an old man arrived and wished to remove the ave on his wound on the right thumb.
According to him, he is already good, and is pleading to rush the treatment because he wants to reach his engagement for 30 minutes.

His response to me, is that he needs to reach the right time at the home of the elderly (nursing home) so that her husband will be selfish.
I researched what his situation is.
He mentioned to me that he has been living in the house and victim for a long time (Alzheimer's disease).
In our conversation.
I asked if her husband is worried for him to be arrested when it comes to the right time.

"His calm reply to me was" I don't notice him, in fact, even though I'm not known for the past five years. "
"I was shocked with the specific text of him and I asked him again," At I still continue to go to the house every morning, even if he does not know you? "
A healthy smile was given in exchange and she squeezed my right hand, along with the statement, "I did not know me, but I knew him!"
I tried to stop my tears.
And when she left, he will have the initiative to remove and make the path to my both cheeks.
Speaking to myself, "Ito the kind of love I want to happen in my life."

True love is not a physical or romanticism.
True love is to accept whatever is included in a relationship; there is no condition, threats, reasoning or reason and any concert.
If the past will happen, what will happen, and not reliable.
This is not a pipti (50 / 50) duty, but this is a huge percentage of appreciation, compassion, and significant love for each other.
