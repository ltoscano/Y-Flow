The Torres family is preparing for the return of the head of the family of staff server Domingo Torres.
But they thought it was a happy return.
Torres was replaced with extreme sadness for the twelve soldiers who died after being ambushed by a rebel group in Barangay I beat the beat yesterday because he always says that he will go home to clean and switching the questions.
We have two pillows.
The disappointment and regret of the family Victoria said by private first Class Dancing Viloria also hurts.
He will join his co-workers.
Janette coins also rushed to the funeral parlor.
Yes, the case filed by the deceased soldier is the private first Class Lorenzo that's why he was crushed when he saw the corpse here, it seems hard to accept sir, but there is already there.
Maybe until there is only one of his life, including the deceased soldiers, the official try to make a secret that a civilian was also killed in the convoy of the soldiers.
Three are wounded including another civilian who is saddened by the kind of siblings who are dead.
I did not fight in front of him to be ashamed.
