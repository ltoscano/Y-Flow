Manny Pacquiao once proved his skill in boxing when he defeated American boxing copation Chris Algieri.
In the 12 rounds, Algieri was only one in the round, which also fell to Luna only six times after being hit by the strong punches of Pacman.
Algieri seemed like a chick that did not do anything but dance and run around the ring to avoid the bigotry of the national fist.
Algieri did not fall away, the latest winner of Manny that this is proof that he can still fight even in the world Class boxer.
That's why if Floyd Mayweather is brave, well, he fought to know who is really in the two of Pacquiao's greatest boxer of all time.
It's because it's difficult for Mayweaheer, it is all incredible.
The truth is, the reason why he does not want to fight, he might lie down to Luna when he was hit by the fist of Pacman.
Pacman is really Hanep.
