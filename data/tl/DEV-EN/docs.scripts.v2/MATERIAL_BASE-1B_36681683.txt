Doubt in DOTC.
We're going to get a lot MORE.

A billion peso is almost lost in the Philippines in the controversial decision of the Dept. of Transportation & Communications that will be a video der in the Autoa fare Collection System (AFCS) project for the Metro Rail Transit (MRT) and Light Rail Transit (LRT).
This is the truth: Even Turkey's embassy has a negative reaction because of the controversial "attack" on E-Trans Solutions, partner of Kentkart's company Turkish.
The complaint of our fellowmen from E-Trans Solutions, more than 800million pesos is the height that they will give to the government compared to the offer of the elected bidder AF Consortium, which is almost the same and seemingly talked to their own "bid."
The further doubt is the "disqualify" of the DOTC at E-Trans Solutions because of the alleged object "technical" so he did not look into the ability and how much he offers for the treasury of the country.
The DOTC was not included in the "discussion," if there is something?
We can't blame it if Turkish Embassy Commercial Counsellor Ceath Besogul, who also wrote to DOTC Secretary.
Joseph Abaya, as a protest and asks the fair treatment of the E-Trans Solutions, partner of Kentkart, which is a respected company in Turkey.
The "bid" of the E-Trans Solutions should be examined compared to the "bid" of the elected company and the people can see what will take advantage of the government and the Filipino people.
This is the truth!
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
