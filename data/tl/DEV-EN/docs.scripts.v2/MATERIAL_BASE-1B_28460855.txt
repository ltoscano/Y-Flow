We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Many are talking in my last column that I said that Senator Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos could change and straighten out the mistakes of his parents during the time of martial law.
Some of our readers said that I have written the column because I did not experience blogging by the Marcos dictatorship.
What should be said, Bongbong admitted to the sin of his family and asked for forgiveness to the people.
I am saddened by these comments because it is clear for me that this is a kind of closing mind.
First, the big part of the Filipino people experienced blogging during the time of dictatorship and we are together in this part.
But I did not close my mind to identify a leader with a good enough to change our society even if he is.
This is a matter of progress in the country and not my personal feelings or experience.
The sin of his father or mother should not be given to the child.
I have an opinion that they will say that they will get rid of their parents because of the mistakes made.
One more thing, I believe that Bongbong might have learned from the mistake that her parents did.
It is possible that a creature like Bongbong is going to change towards the goodness, although I also cannot deny that he may not have learned.
Still, as a Christian, I will be gambling in belief that he changed towards the goodness.
Again, I repeat... the sin of the parents should not be given to the child because if that happens, no one has the right to handle the enda of power.
All of us are also victims of the mistakes of our parents or their respective parents.
What do you think?
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
