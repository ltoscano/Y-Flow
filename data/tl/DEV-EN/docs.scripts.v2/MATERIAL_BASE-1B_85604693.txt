Perhaps many will be surprised if one of the collection of tourists going to China is the "beauty industry" there, particularly plastic surgery.
The Chinese in beautifying and because they are now having extra "money to spend" because of the economic growth since the country opened the door for the world, the rise of "beauty industry" is becoming positive.
And this is even more efficient to go to tourists in China.
But according to the report of the China Daily, it is more Chinese national who is threatening the neighboring country of South Korea for the similar beauty service.
So, if there are a lot of tourists who go to China to make sure, more Chinese people go to South Korea for the more advanced technology of beauty collective surgery.
What we are pointing out here are the various ways to pull the tourists.
If China and South Korea have a technology for beauty collections and they use it for the tourists to go to their country, what do we have?
It is also famous for our beauty bloggers like Vicky Belo and wife Calayan example.
I have friends who every time they go home to the Philippines from other countries, together with what they will always visit Belo and Calayan clinics.
It is said that it is cheaper here in the Philippines and the "pet Filipino is still different."
Speaking of "care," isn't it that we are known in the whole world - in our being loving to the people we are taking care of, map of domestic helpers or medical assistance.
There is a unique brand of concern and care of the Filipinos.
So like China and South Korea, we benefit from our skill and talent for the improvement of tourism in the country.
If the plastic surgery is too controversial for us, there are still many others that we can push and push, if there is a support of the government to help the tourism and contribute to the improvement of the economy of the country.
