By Kevin Mark R. Gomez Ito my favorite quote last year, I picked up a GE subject on the first sem I DUP.
It is not like that, not even Witty, but it is easy to understand and have a recall for me.
In fact, this served as a battle for my first month in university.
That's why even if it seems that the top of the top men of those who like me was burned down to ashes like me, I was not afraid of many things.
It is hardworking to get a readings, too obedient to the schedule, act as long as possible, fressful.
But I am trying to get up with this kind of ereotype in freshmen; I don't want to be called "fressful" even if it is true.
That's why in the first round, I applied for three org - one that I cannot visit the expense of the application Process, a rare thing I can visit now even at the foot of Vinzons, and an almost apparatus that was treated me as a result of my disruption to KulEclipse.
BS Org says I am a joke of the blockmates before.
At the same time, it was also the first time that I became a member of KulEclipse, because I was encouraged by the style of far from the embedded media outlets that are often press release of the school.
I also want to work a bit challenging and will eat a long Break between GE classes.

It is also not impossible that the time that you will be included in the people who swore at the Philippines because it was disowned by the careful "tivity" and "neutrality" of the media.
In any path that you will make me inside the university, my advice, sibling: To open and broaden your thoughts on everything that is happening above the "cultural surrounding."
Learn to witness, be sensitive and be critical - to know the ad in not, the sharp in acting and the real of the pretending.
The UP is wide, and you are drowned in its entirety now, but the world is wide outside, where there is no space in modern mind and dangerous hoping for real change.

Maybe at that point you read this, you are ready to enter and eager to start your life UP.

Being practical is time to make mistakes and learn, opportunity to comment and be proper.
