We can do: He is not a hero By Harvey Keh August 5, 2016 there are news that the burial of former President Ferdinand Marcos in the Libingan ng mga Bayani will now be discussed in Malaca√±ang next month.
This became an issue in the election and this is one of the promised by President Rody Duterte during the campaign.
Many groups protested and will surely oppose if Duterte will pursue it.
Even Vice President Leni Robredo is against this plan.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
I think the proposal of former Senate President Aquilino "Nene" Pimentel is more beautiful in the town of Batac, Ilocos Norte to bury the remains of Marcos.
According to Pimentel, he loves the people there in Batac so it is better that he will be buried there to stop several years of debate about this issue.
For me, Marcos should not be buried in the Libingan ng mga Bayani.
Marcos is known in the whole world as one of the leaders of the country with the biggest stolen from the government.
He is known as a implemented law where thousands of Filipinos lost and killed by military and police.
Is it a heroes who stole billions of billions in funds of the country?
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Is it being considered as a leader who has already killed our freedom and agreed to the left murder of those who expressed resistance to the peace negotiations.
Until now, the Marcos family is not yet buried their stolen from our country.
Until now, justice is still screaming for thousands of families who lost their relatives during martial law.
Even a student in grade 3 knows what the meaning of being a hero.
We can be considered a hero for a person who sacrifice for the betterment of others and the country.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We cannot be considered a hero a leader that used his power to cultivate himself and his family.
If we will not object and let us allow Marcos to be buried in the Libingan ng mga Bayani, we will reflect the youth that a hero is the leader in his power and stole the treasury of the country.
Even once, the Marcos family did not even apologize and apologized for the sin that they did to our country.
Is this kind of leadership what we want to make an example for the next generation of Filipinos?
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Hopefully not.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
