VP Leni resist the Land conversion ban By Bernard Taguinod October 15, 2016 when Vice President Leni Robredo made the plan of the Executive Department to implement the ban on the Land conversion within two years because it is a big effect on the government's efforts to give a house to the citizens without their own house and lot.
In the petition signed by Robredo, chairperson of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC), he requested that the release of the "blanket" Executive Order (WBC) will consider the release of the "blanket" Executive Order (copy) that will let the Land conversion within two years.
Aside from the HUDCC, the Department of Finance (DOF), Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA).
Militant groups first suggested the ban on the Land conversion to ensure that the agricultural Land cannot be convert to Industrial.
However, due to the "blanket" of the copy, Robredo is worried that even the land plans of the housing project will be affected, which is why he is worried that the Housing projects of the government has been delayed.
"The proposed blanket two-year ban on Land use conversion will introduce further delays in the Housing and resettlement processes, which will be erbate the insurmountable Housing backlog that we are working to address," according to Robredo.
The housing project is mainly affected by the Yolanda-affected area because these areas in the Eastern Visayas region are all inside the agricultural zones.
