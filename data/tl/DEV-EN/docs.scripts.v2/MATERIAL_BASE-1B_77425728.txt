Be armed with information on the campaign against illegal drugs, January 21, 2017 in the ongoing campaign against illegal drugs, it cannot be denied that this fight of the Duterte government is slowly being caught.
Despite the government, particularly the Philippine National Police (PNP), there are still many things to clean, the success of war against illegal drugs is already felt.
However, despite the perceived success in the campaign of illegal drugs, it is sad that the force that is destroying the good goal of the PNP to sweep the involved in illegal drugs.
This is due to the involvement of some officials and personnel of the PNP in the kidnapping and murder of the Korean businessman arrested using the campaign "Oplan Tokhang."
It is clear from the information coming out that the group involved in the crime was used in the illegal drugs of the government to earn because it was a huge amount of money from the businessman's camp in exchange for freedom but eventually discovered that there was no life.
These kinds of events are alarm so it is important for the public to be alert to the syndicates or corrupt cops using Oplan Tokhang or Oplan Tapper of PNP in their illegal activities.
That is why it is important for us to be armed with knowledge about the right process of the campaign of the government so that it won't reach the fate of the businessman.
As part of the process is the formal invitation to an individual, especially if there is a complaint through letters.
The police cannot force him to invite because they have the right to invite to refuse and get a lawyer to defend.
