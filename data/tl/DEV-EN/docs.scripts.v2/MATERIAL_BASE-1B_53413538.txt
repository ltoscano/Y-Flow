We can do: Those who aspire for the New Year By Harvey Keh, December 30, 2016 two days in 2017, and bringing the opening of another New Year is the new hope for every Filipino.
This is also the time for us to return to this year to look at the important experiences in our lives and the important lessons we learned.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
If there is an important chance that we will look back from the year 2016, this is his lessons to further improve our lives.
Next year, one of my desires should prevail and peace in our country will prevail.
Hopefully the left killings that are happening now, especially that many innocent children are included here.
Aside from this, hopefully the culture of death in our country should be stopped and the death penalty should be stopped because we believe that every person has the ability to change their lives.
One more thing I wish for the New Year, hopefully some important promises of our government will push through the end of this year.
Included here is the free treatment of the poor in the hospitals implemented by the Department of Health (DOH) and providing free tuition fee for every young students of State Colleges and Universities in the whole country.
If this will be fulfilled, the entry of 2017 will be good for every Filipino.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
For the end, hopefully in the New Year we should not visit and damage big accidents like typhoons which seem to be growing every year.
Many of our countrymen continue to rise from the conflict of some typhoon that passed us this 2016 so hopefully they will recover from their lives.
Before the New Year came, we allocate time with our family and loved ones to thank our Lord for the past year.
Let us also pray for our country to prevail in the entire Philippines and the lives of every Filipino will continue.
A happy and happy New Year to all of you!
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
