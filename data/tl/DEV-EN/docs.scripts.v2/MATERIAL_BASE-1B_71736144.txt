Many lives are changed and the super typhoon "Yolanda can still change."
His effect is not only to the people but also in institutions - including the Armed Forces of the Philippines or Armed Forces of the Philippines and the modernization of this will probably be.
It can be recalled that the leadership of the government is focused on the so-called "minimum credible defense capability" or the ability to defend our country.
Even before the typhoon Pablo has arrived, "Ondoy," etc., the AFP is the main expected to snatch and save the victims.
But Yolanda "is unusual" - not only because it was publicized in history as the strongest typhoon and its extensive damage that brought the Philippines on the map of the world but also because of the biggest gathering of the countries that brought help or / and equipment to assist the Philippines.
That's the deprivation of the government's ability to respond to the calamity, with such an intense and expansion of damage.
Although the AFP immediately respond to the first hours of the death of "Yolanda," the equipment used to be humanitarian and Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR).
There is a need for more ships, airplanes and helicopter to send help not only to airports and airports but directly to barangays who are affected by it.
This is the big challenge to the government.
Due to the cut bridge, they hike a tree, post, and cable that passed through the roads, and destruction of communication - still lack of assistance, 10 days after.
With the influx of many help and equipment from different countries and private organizations, the very big needs of the victims will be solved.
This calamity is a lesson to see what our government should have, including the AFP, to answer the calamity.
This means an additional funding for the Philippine Air Force trucks and helicopters; Philippine Navy sealift vessels; and 6.6 Trucks of the Philippine Army.
In front of numerous threats to security and freedom of our territory in the West Philippine Sea, the government slowly buys some fighter jets, attack helicopter, multi-purpose attack craft, missile ship, and radar system to increase the external defense capability of the country.
But the tension is not subsiding, the declaration of China broke his new Air Defense Identification Zone (AIDG).
In China, China, all entering the zone (make the north of Taiwan; South Korea; and South-west Japan) need to introduce themselves and follow the authors.
That's the East China Sea (ECS) territory, which is affected by South Korea and Japan.
The launch of their airplanes and bomber were asked to launch these countries, including America, against the declared government of China and sending the latter of his aircraft carrier in ECS.
In front of a new announcement on the North west of the Philippines, it is not impossible that we will be affected by the conflict.
This can advise more than the desire to fulfill the "minimum credible defense capability" of the Philippines.
This is in front of the feel of "Yolanda" for the equipment of AFP for HADR.
That's why the funds are not pulling each other again because the 140 characters that need to be used for defending our territory and the one to hold Independence and insecurity in our limits.

Hopefully our leaders see the same needs and give priority to the strengthening of the country that cannot depend on other sectors of society.

We can tap in order to make the commercial air the sea lines in bringing relief goods, medicines, medical professionals, and workers and supplies for rehabilitation operations and Internally Displaced Persons.
We can use the ships owned by the reservists of the Philippine Navy like now.
Other countries may help in medical, relief and rehabilitation operations.
But only the AFP will defend our country.
