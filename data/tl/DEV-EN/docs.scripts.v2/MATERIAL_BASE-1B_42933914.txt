We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Even if it is steam, high or killing of anticipated species.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.

We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Reporting by amok (Lawrence Fajardo, director, 2011) in the amok, the Eclipse, the Eclipse, and gambling, selling barbeque, thrift shop and gun, passengers waiting for the terminal, old, gay men, and other creatures - people who are not known aside from the entry of arbitrary moments in the corner of EDSA and Pasay Taft - are being placed as an ordinary life in this country.
Simultaneously, the time of the movie is not an ordinary moment.
This is a violation of the long-term life of the people, cities and countries under the culture of immigrant.
There is no care of the violence because of the democratic history of those in power, and the flow of it on daily lives.
The problem in the movie is presented by the daily confusion of violence and culture of the responsibility without linking the history and civic works.
Microckic is going to be transferred, even on the main road of the city, it is cruising, which created the responsibility of political power.
There is a traffic enforcer but he did not fully fulfill his duty.
The police is a gangster who is assigned by arson in the community of poor people who live in the city.
Ambulance and investigators arrive in the scene of the crime to make a post-mortem report.
There is no implication in the life of the state.
In the time of Lino Brocker, this is simple: The poster and portrait of the official in the office of the mayor and ordinary citizens, images of the altar, picture of Rambo beside Marcos, for example.
In the amok, there is a staging of action, like the scene where the bloody with a gun is taking the EDSA while the familiar expire that "prohibited to cross, deadly" is also in the scene.
The result, like the entirety of the movie, is restricting or mixed with the person who will hold the real.
The political commentary is not sharp because of the responsibility of the MMDA, Metro handsome, Noynoy Aquino, Palparan, Willie Revillame, and other FBI of actual power.
And the worst problem of the film: The representation of the anticipated kind.
In the culture of sexuality, activists and journalists have been identified as the political victim.
But the anticipated citizen is also part of the privatization of the state that is insane, instead of being able to improve the harness of the civic justice, he goes wild, and more excuses for who are both anticipated to be victimized.
This is the burgeous realism in indie Cinema, to give a representation of the anticipated species to have been locked up in a translator: The capacity of the anticipated species to be devoured by his kind just to explode.
The massacre is the massacre as well as a similar kind of father in the terminal will be a witness to the liver of a young child, as well as the driver who is a sibling in the van to his younger sibling.
The film was boosted because of the fragmentation of staff, scenes and stories, and the cultural relationship between them at the moment of the attack.
It is very different but at the expense of the anticipated kind, it seems that we are just watching a familiar quarrel of the neighbor who is threatening, snatching and lifting, chaos of jumping jubs in the U.P. Fair, and other speeds that are worried about the body of the anticipated species.
There was a fabulous happening in the amok, because the street is the one who takes the rest of the life and death.
No referendum, which is a trait of indie Cinema at present.
But there will be a change of change, like Brillante Mendoza.
There is a change due to the director, celebrity, audience, connivance and discussing the film, it is also included in the mold of the state: People who cannot be known aside from a similar source and civic works.
There is a difference between the urge to make the same position in society, and it is dangerous for the "lack of race" (in the case of the movie, this kind of), which is a jackpot as a resolution of the sovereignty and civic problems.
