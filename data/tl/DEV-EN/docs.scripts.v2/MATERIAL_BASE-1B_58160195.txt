We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Our sincere condolences to Quezon City Mayor Herbert Bautista, and his siblings Harlene and Hero.
Painful but life should go on.
Their beloved father, Herminio "Butch" Baustista last Tuesday Morning.
Butch is also an artist and went out of the movies being made by late Fernando Poe Jr.
Their group is marked in the showbiz world, the Lo "Waist Gang who almost woke up in the box office of the cinema where they were bringing back then.
During that time, the length of Theater is not a trend that the local movie will come out.
Aside from FPJ and Butch, also a member of the Lo "Waist Gang are Boy Sta.
Romana, Boy Francisco, Zaldy Zhornack, Bobby Gonzalez, Mario Antonio, then everyone, and Tony Cruz, who is one of the most talented dancer during their time.
The leading lady, if our sign is right, Corazon Rivas, who is Pablo Santiago, is designed.
For those mentioned by Lo Waist Gang, they seem to breathe in the presence of Lord God.
It is sad, but death is a part of life, that is why the rest of the Philippines, sir Butch.
And let Perpetual light Shine through them.
There is their souls rest in peace!
Amen.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
