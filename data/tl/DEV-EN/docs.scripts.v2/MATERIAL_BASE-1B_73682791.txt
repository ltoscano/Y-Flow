We are here for generations and times when many are thinking of problems than thinking about the solution.
When President Rodrigo "Digong" Duterte started his war against illegal drugs, many asked, where the government who have surrendered and drug addicts are going to be brought when the government allegedly lacks drug rehabilitation facilities.
President Digong had a solution when removing the Mega Drug Abuse Treatment and rehabilitation Center (MDACA) in Fort Magsaysay, Nueva Ecija for the help of a Chinese philantroist.
But it is not really losing criticisms or comments that the President does not want to believe the syndicate of illegal drugs in the country.
Before President Digong removed Oplan Tokhang at the hands of the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) many complained about the abuse of other people of the police.
According to them, those who kill the suspected drug addicts and drug pushers are the hands of the syndicate.
The total number reached 1,189,462 surrendered based on Rappler's report.
The addicts that surrendered have reached 1,110,113 while the pushers were 79,349.
Because Digong did not speed up and act on his cabinet, here is the new problem in the operation of the MDACA under the Department of Health (DOH) led by Secretary Paulyn Jean Rosell-Ubial.

Almost 127 patients from Bulacan and Nueva Ecija were being treated and being cared for in the MDACA, which said there was a capacity of 10,000 patients.
The MDACA opened last 30 November 2016.
But up to now 127 are undergoing rehabilitation.
Secretary Ubial admitted that they are "caught flat-footed, unprepared" because of the speed of operation and many who have surrendered and pushers.
But he considers the drug epidemic in the country is a "health problem."
He said, "Abusers Are mental health patients WHO need to (be) cured."
"Then, why is it that DOH is not able to hasten the process to put those who have surrendered and pushers who have surrendered?
"The said billion-billion fund, why not use it to get doctors, nurses, ologists, social workers and therapists!
Are all problems that will appear there in MDACA, they will pass it to President Digong before they think of a resolution?
Where are those from DOH and DDB, who are always permitted to join any seminar and studies in other countries in relation to illegal drug abuse!
Why don't they put it in the MDACA?
President Digong is thinking about how to resolve the problem "?!
Can you really do work there in MDACA, Secretary Ubial?
Well, declare you early while there is a fund.
You might raise your hand when you don't have funds and then you will shout "I gave up!"
Thank you, Madam Secretary, "centerpiece" program of President Digong "that.
I will just repeat, Madam Secretary, so do you work there in MDACA or not?!
