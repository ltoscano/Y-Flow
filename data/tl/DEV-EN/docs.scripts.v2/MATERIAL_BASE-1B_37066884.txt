Take it slow in the story By Rey Marfil January 16, 2017 lucky by senior citizens in the Philippines because they are taking care of the government.
First is because the benefits of some service, even in food, medicine and other Eclipse of the elderly are 60 years old.
But do you know the story that is given to our beloved senior citizens is being abused?
We said that they were abused because they usually carry the grandsons and grandmother to pay for a grocery or gift.
Of course, because of the grandfather and grandmother, they will buy a story about what they will buy, especially for presents.
One notice of the establishment, the senior citizens card is being abused using a well-owned donut.
He donut the donut company and be appointed store where in the corner of the Philippines, there is no line.
That is why this is one of the favorite buying of presents using the discount card of seniors.
What if not, a very big story is what they give, not similar to some restaurants, bakessions or other markets that are limited to eaten by a senior in the story that is only right because this is the law's statements.
I do not want to be good but the company is pitiful because when it comes to the day, they closed and they are selling the very big story, it will be given to the seniors who are usually used by children, grandchildren or other relatives, IDs to buy discounted donut.
At the moment our fellow countrymen who lose their jobs are sacrificed because of the abuses done by some of our countrymen.
That's why I hope this can be seen by some of the companies that will walk in order to correct or if not, implement a little restriction for the welfare of the future of their personnel.
I want to assert that we are not against the benefits that we cannot stomach; the abuse of some of the benefits that should be just for the needs of our grandparents, mother and father.
Anyway, it is very hard to help those who take advantage of the benefits for our senior citizens, it is better for the companies to act.
Give to what is right, but make sure that they recognize the requested story because if there are opportunist relatives of seniors who use the preview of grandparents, grandmother, the companies who do not care about the elderly who are asking for stories when this is the law's statements.
Our call, use the benefits given by the government.
Don't take advantage because someone is about to be hit.
Always remember: "You are young and I am the spy of you."
We're going to get a lot MORE.

We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
