Attack in the Senate.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
The "gate-crashing" by Navotas Rep. Toby Tiangco, United Nationalist Alliance interim president (UNA) and Atty.
JV Bautista, UNA interim secretary general, while the Blue Ribbon "sub-committee" hearing of the Senate is in the midst of a serious effect.
First, because one of the things that Representative Tiangco is also a lawmaker.
It means, parekly, he knows that even in the rules of the hearings of Congress, that kind of task will not be executed.
But because they are desperate to consider the riches that Vice-Pres.
Jojo Binay preferred to destroy the talks to destroy the talks or beauty manners.
Nognog will be able to defend himself.
King-ina!
Most of all, repeatedly, Binay will be invited to the said hearing to explain his side.
But their camp chose not to be sent even if he was invited and his allies who were not invited to the Senate!
That's as if their message is, then, you have turned away the character of our boss because of his "piggery" in Batangas, then, "we will not disrespect your hearing!
The fight is really a pig now!
It's good that Senator Drilon is not there!
Asked VP Binay: Why don't you really want to attend the investigation in the Senate?
What is your fear "truth" that might explode in your face if you will attend?
Suggestions to Binay: Why are you not the one who showed up in the Senate so the documents brought by Representative Tiangco?
Request for Nognog: Hopefully, if you don't really want to attend the Senate, do not disrespect or let them get away from your followers.
So that the people will not notice that you are just afraid of the possible facts while the demolition is growing, I mean, investigation of the Senate.
So if you cannot save your face, just save the dignity of your followers like Tiangco.
To aim to save you, I am starting to look like the discussion in the hearing of Congress!
Mister Binay has a lot of people who will be affected because of it possible.
I hope you should not involve them with the destruction behind!
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
