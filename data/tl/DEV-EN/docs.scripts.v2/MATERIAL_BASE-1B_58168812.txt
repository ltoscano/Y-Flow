President, stop using drugs! "
This is the call of Senator Leila de Lima to President Rodrigo Duterte to return the outrage of the President because of the search of Fentanyl, a drugs as a pain reliever in the disease of cancer and other chronic ailments.
The President admitted last week that he uses Fentanyl to lose the pain of his spinal injury in the previous accident in the motorcycle.
However, the effect of the said medication is worried because this affects the minds of a person and this is also an act of addicts or addicts.
The senator is hoping that if the President will stop to find the President, he might be able to recover and admit the failure to accompany him on the list of politicians involved in illegal drugs.
"Mister President, stop drugs so for even one single Second you can experience a lucid interval and discover how crazy This drug war witch-hunting has become," said De Lima in a statement.
The senator is also wondering why many people are still believed in the statement of President Duterte on the narco-list after he admitted that the Fentanyl was tirred.
"And least I, whom he recklessly accuses as a narco-politician, haven't taken a single-tive drug in my life, while those who ran amok and froths in the mouth like a rabid Animal has the temerity to make up a list, when he should be on the top of the list," said De Lima.
