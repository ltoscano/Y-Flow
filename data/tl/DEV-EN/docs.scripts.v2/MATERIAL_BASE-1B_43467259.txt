ISPORT!: Vargas' fans By Zaldy Perez August 7, 2016 Ibaeanother's reaction to the news that Jesse Vargas was chosen for the comeback fight of Senator Manny Pacquiao in Nov.
5 this year.
Some are saying that the fight is terrifying (boring).
They prefer Terence Crawford or Danny Garcia or Mene Broner.
"The others said Vargas chose not to suffer the age of Pacquiao, which on December 17 will be 38 years old.
But wait first.
Vargas is not the current WBO welterweight champion.
Implementing his title defense against Sadam Ali via 9th round stoppage.
Vargas is also not a joke because he used to be a WBA and IBO superhero champion.
What is worse is that if you remember, Timothy Bradley almost reached the 12th round of their fight in June 2015.
Vargas is only 27, and the Height of this is 5-11 which is for Antonio Margarthis that Pacquiao has done before.
That's why Vargas is more quick and he is deadlier compared to Margarthis.
That's why there are fans that are angot because they do not like Vargas which is the enemy of Pacquiao, just wait because after this, Floyd Mayweather Jr. is his next opponent.
