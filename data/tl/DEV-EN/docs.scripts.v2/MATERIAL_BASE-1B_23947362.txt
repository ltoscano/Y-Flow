What is this? - name withheld.
Blood on the spitting or the bloody sputum (Eclipse) is a lot of reasons.
It is usually brought by an infection in the lungs or Airways such as Acute bronchitis or pneumonia.
This is also one of the symptoms of lung cancer.
If the problem is not in the lungs, the Eclipse will also come from the nose, upper gastrodes.
If you do not have TB but your cough is strong and often, it will cause an Eclipse.
If you have a complete medical examination, it is easy to see what is the cause of this.
The doctor will know if there is a problem in the lungs.
If no one can see this, you came to a lung specialist or themselves to be sure what your illness is.
