Kobe, Rousey January 3, 2017, Ronda Rousey was looking for an ally after his disastrous first round TKO loss in the hands of Amanda Nunez in UFC 207 on Saturday (Manila time).
The past criticism was accepted by Rousey after the fight, especially on social media.
But, there was one defended Rousey - no one else but the only porting actor, NBA superstar Kobe Bryant.
Through Twitter on the evening of New Year, Bryant said that instead of criticizing Rousey, he should be thank and give a standing ovation because of its role in order to become the Women's sports fruit of his "electrifying and lightning quick submissions."
The former Los Angeles Lakers star also knows how to feel when you fail, and go to the bottom, regarding the sub-30 win seasons in his final year in the NBA.
So it is not surprising that Kobe will defend Rousey.
