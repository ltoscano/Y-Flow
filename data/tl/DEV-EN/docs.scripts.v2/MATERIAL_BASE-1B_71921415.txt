By Jerome Tagaro in the start of classes, our troops are still there every time it rolls: Long queue, humid weather, and nonstop going out.
Also included here is the search in classification of the recovered subjects, familiar with new classmates, recognition and guarantees of the new professor.
But with all my friends, only one can be considered best.
I met her when I reached college, and he did not leave me since then.
Our relationship with each other is more important now, especially since I have spent two years in UP.
He is the class of a friend that is going to go out.
If I am with her, I have forgotten what I should do.
He dictates the course of the semestre.
As long as possible, I put all the allowers that I have in every one subject.
My friend is governing when and where will I pass.

There are others who are just considered an acquaintance or "a classmate, and there are also almost siblings who seem to be treated.
Why is it that the influence of my friend to our students?
You can also not say if the subject is pulling hard while it goes on, or increasing what is being done, especially to those who are being possessed, or those from UP are becoming lazy, while it goes to university.
In this situation, it is important to our back to what is really the reason why we are at university.
Even if this is personal or dictated by the opportunity, it is important to us to keep in mind again so that we will not be malignant in the path that you will make.
You might be here so that when the time is to serve the country, help your parents, or maybe it is just for you to do something in your life but whatever reason, this should not stop from pushing us to learn.
Even if you are a friend of laziness in a very long time, it does not mean that you will continue to fall into the trap in our lives.
Commemorate your inspiration again.
But with your face again on the basis of your actions, you will slowly lay down the cement in the path that you will make.
It is important to remember our parents that they will get away from the bone, pay for those who love tuition, your relatives and children who are on the school's education, and the tax of the people who send us all.

He is still growing up every time I think of all of these.
Since now, I will often remember them, I hope that she will finally get away from me.
