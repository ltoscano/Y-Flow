"IMPECCABLE," or the word Filipino is "perfect," the help of the United States Naval ship (USNS) Impeccable to the 11 fishermen in the West Philippines Sea last week.
This is the truth: The USNS Impeccable in Subic Bay when Filipinos were able to reach their boat filled with water and dip in the sea.
No one will hesitate to be saved by the civilians and "Navy Men" of the USNS Impeccable, 11 Filipinos, who were dismissed, fed and brought in Subic was eport where they should be stopped in the custody of the 11th audio cadron of the Philippine Coast Guard headed by SBMA Deputy Administrator (DA) Randy Escolango.
The fishermen were personally welcomed and accompanied by the fishermen of Escolango to the SBMA Dispensary to analyze the status of the health and the blessing of SBMA Chairman Roberto V. Garcia, were brought through a SBMA bus going home to their families in Zambales.
This is the truth: Although the US Navy owned the USNS Impeccable, it is not a warship but "survey" of the ocean and under it.
No more than 50 people were on board that were all civilians apart from some active members of the US Navy.
This is the truth: In 2009, Chinese vessels attacked the USNS Impeccable in the West Philippines Sea without any care and arogist claiming of the country China.
In a separate incident, the USS Impeccable of the Chinese vessels would be stopped and forcefully put in front of no notice on what the intention of them was, the front and sometimes even approached by the 25 vendors.
A bomb of water is the defense of the USNS Impeccable that is not armed because it is not a military ship so they were forced to stay away from the Chinese vessels.
It has been a long time and many times that China has been harass in the West Philippines Sea even in the American ships.
What about our fishermen they are offering a source of livelihood.
