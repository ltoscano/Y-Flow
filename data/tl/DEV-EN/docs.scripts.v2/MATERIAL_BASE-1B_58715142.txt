If there is no discipline in a home, the foundation of the morality of children is growing, so they are losing respect for each other and the parents themselves.
The lack of this is the reason for the failure of the parents to implement policies that we have to guide children that are growing.
If parents failed in this matter, their children are losing respect for the time, money and trying to reject the recognition of the things that they need to grow normal.
To the musings of no discipline, allow children to do what they want... so because they want them, for example, the Hotdog, hamburger and chicherya, their parents are really giving up because they love their children that they want.
If the children are sick or cannot be sickly, the other parents grew sickly, because of their doubt, and when the blame is trying to hide is dirty water and wind!

No matter how much progress is a country if most of its citizens have no discipline, progress is losing significance.
The lack of discipline will become an obstacle in the development of other countries.
Under the democracy, lack of discipline is the reason why the citizens are having a sense and greed.
Planted in their minds that the implementation of discipline is their freedom so they are driving the rally to show their objections to laws related to it.
The judiciary is also not helping with the explanation of the law because of the non-care issue of the temporary restraining Order (TRO) because it is appropriate for the constitution and democracy.... but serving a hole that can be examined by the corrupt, which is why they are abused.

Singapore has succeeded in having a really real progress because of the discipline.
At the start, the citizens reacted but eventually, they also understood the good purpose, especially when they used a like iron fist against them.
Citizens of other countries are jealous of the prosperity of Singapore.... just as envious.
I did not think that those who are envious of the development of Singapore is discipline and objected by those who are envious of this to be implemented in their country like the Philippines because it is their repression to their freedom!

In a jeepney, excited about a woman about his tour in Singapore.
The other mixture of sandwich can still take away from his mouth while saying that he is going along with food.
The road of the roads in Singapore is clean, that is what the hotel loves.
When he ran out the sandwich and flesh of the bottle of mineral water, he threw the wrapped of sandwich and bashing plastic outside the jeep while he was running along Taft Avenue!
When his friend accosted him, his answer was... "no, I was cleaning the road"!
Now, who can't be cheap because of this attitude?
