It was said that it was once lost in circulation because it was hot on the eyes of the media the widespread cigarettes of different brand in Balintawak Market at the part of the fruit stand.
The vendor said that I was able to talk to the police who were selling fake cigarettes.
Often the fake cigarettes are usually included in the street vendors in EDSA.
The victims are mostly jeepney drivers.
At the amount of P30, they will have a set of Marlboro, which can be bought by 70 in the majors.
The smell of the poop of the chicken and pork in Marilao, Bulacan after entering the exit of Marilao, the left, it is definite that the passengers and motorists enter the exit of Marilao, in the past, it is sure that the passengers and motorists will cover their noses, especially if the board is just an ordinary bus, because the foul poop and rotten organs of the chicken in a river in the said place.
That is why the smell of the river where the poop and rotten organs of the chicken is foul, the water is not flowing even if it rained even if it rained even if it rained even if it rained down because it was barado.

The police in PCP-5 of Pasay Pacman is a police assigned in EDSA, in front of Kabayan Hotel.
The police said that "that is nothing but catch the taxi drivers that are lined up by passengers in front of the said hotel.
It is prohibited!
Why "the passenger jeepney that" greets and sharing, are not catching them and have not been used to it?
Why taxi drivers?
It seems that the suspicion is right, that is why the jeepney drivers are free!
