We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
Yesterday, it is like the boxing of Manny Pacquiao watched the citizenship... Lahore "is focused on the hearing in the Senate, even the taxi drivers, the radio in the ongoing hearing.
While your servant is watching, we felt pity for Senator Leila de Lima.
I felt pity because he made a Circus This.
Is he after a propaganda?
Sympathy?
Defend himself?
It is true that he can get sympathy, but what can the sympathy do if she has been charged with a case related to the accusation that he benefited from money as a protector of the operation of illegal drugs?
We were even more concerned when we saw the expression of the control that he controlled while the prosecutor, Kerwin Espinosa and Ronnie Dayan, were allegedly lies in the legislative chamber.
But he could not look eye-to-eye with lover boy Dayan, she is always looking at Kerwin.
"The faces" of Papa Ronnie.
Did she not even think of a wise senator that she is starting to look funny!
It is better that Senator De Lima should just inhibit so that the prosecution of Kerwin and Ronnie would not appear again.
He should just wait for him to file a case for the court to defend and defend himself especially that he is saying that Kerwin and Ronnie are all lies.
"That is if he has a strong evidence to deny all the accusations against him!
In the meantime, protect yourself, Senator De Lima!
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
We're going to get a lot MORE.
