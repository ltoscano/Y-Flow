Map of Syria in the Middle East Air strikes on any day last week in Syria, where a War in ousting the president of the Country, Bashar al-Assad. The country is currently in Alert Level 4 because of the conflict. In the midst of the chaos, many Filipinos are in an uncertain situation until now it is hard to go home because of the failure of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the embassy of the Philippines in Syria to take care of their welfare. Syria's situation at all, criticized by the Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW), in the leadership of Migrante International, the role of the United States for the quick aggravating situation in Syria towards a war-civil war. The US and its allies have direct meddling in the Internal discussion of the country. "Like what happened in Libya, the United States formed a coalition to oust (Syrian President Bashar) al-Assad. The forces of US-NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) is lurking under the alleged humanitarian mission. But the United Nations and the Arab League is blessed with the military and air strikes in the said country, "said Garry Martinez, chairman of Migrante International. Democrats fear that the bloody attack of the US in Libya will possibly happen in Syria. "The call of the citizens of Syria for change, which they think is useful in their Country. "But any force has not made both parties, and the citizens of Syria should allow the citizens of Syria to resolve their issues," Martinez added. He is pounding on the government of Migrante International to help the OFWs caught in the war in Syria. (Contribution) grief of the OFWs in a press conference yesterday, a few women who have been able to return to the country have been able to return to the country for their plight in the middle of the conflict in Syria. The content of their stories are the difficulty in escape from employers, lack of food, and lack of communication to loved ones even inside the embassy of the Philippines. According to OFWs from Syria, their employers did not allow Filipino employees to go out of the house. Accounts of coply Mae Cruz, from January last year was the suffering of OFWs trying to ask help from the embassy. But when he reached the embassy, they were still imprisoned. "It seems that we just let us go there that almost don't have food to eat." "There's almost a year there and haven't been able to go home," he said. According to the OFWs, a small amount of food given by the embassy, is that they have contributed to a small piece of chicken. At once, they have eaten a rotten Meat. "IT's really difficult. "You can eat what you don't really eat," said Elizabeth Golong. Due to the intense war in Syria, Filipinos who are working there are in danger of danger. It is also difficult for communication because the cellphones of the OFWs were confiscated. Arnulfa confirms that he is not able to talk to his son Analyn, who is now in Syria. Martinez asked, "why did our embassy denied their tools to be used in communication with our countrymen?" The story of Jocelyn Orpiada, who was included in the default center is a fellow victim of rape. "When he was able to go out to go to the embassy, and rode a taxi, he was raped by the driver and threw him in a crowded place in Damascus. "Luckily, he was concerned about helping him and brought him to the hospital, he said. It was said that there was no investigation that happened and was not yet caught who raped the said Filipina. The DFA argues that Martinez criticized the DFA in the inappropriate treatment of OFWs in Syria, aside from the lack of fixing papers and quickly return to the Philippines. There is a deployment ban in Syria since 2009. But in Migrante's estimation, there are more than 18,000 Filipinos who were able to enter illegal. In the conversation of the representatives of Migrante and some relatives of the OFW to Ricardo Endaya, Executive Director of the Office of the Undersecretary on Migrant Workers Affairs-DFA, it appears that the department has a fund to buy the remaining contract of the OFW who were handed to the deployment ban. But it appears that their work in the country continued. It also appears that the embassy is given a "working permit" by the embassy who are illegal. Endaya also stated in the meeting with a 1096 OFW who made the process to go home. Endaya made sure that there is a corresponding budget for the airfare of the workers. The total deployment cost reached $2,000 to $4,000 in every OFW. But the burial of the OFW who is allegedly due to the slow positives and lack of budget. Two batch only, with a total of 798, has returned to the country. Endaya also denied that the civil war has spread in the entire Syria and needed a thorough return to the Filipinos. As of now, there is only a repatriation effort for Filipinos who are in the cities of Homs, Hama, Idlib and Daraa. Martinez met him. "They are saying that" peaceful "and" not complicated "in other areas, even if we have fellow countrymen who have registered to go home. Do we still wait for violence to spread in other places? What is the basis of Alert Level 4 in the entire country of Syria? " The call of the help of Martinez challenged Pang. Benigno Aquino III to have an immediate release of a position about the situation in Syria, for the sake of thousands of Filipinos who were left there. "If ever President Aquino supported the steps of the United States, and he will not release a position that is against it, it's as if he is also the tear of death to our countrymen who may be criticized by bombs from foreign forces," he said. The call of those who came from Syria is simple and fresh in memory is being attacked. "Elizabeth was begging," we are calling the government to help those left in Syria especially those who are still not able to go out of the house and have not committed a way to go to the embassy. " Migrante also commented, that the DFA has not given any financial assistance for OFWs who have nothing to go home but themselves. Aside from this is the lack of real integration program that will give them work. "We will never get tired of calling the Aquino government without support to the Filipinos caught in chaos in other countries, and do not care about the lack of livelihood in his own country," Martinez said.

I, ten of the other Malaysian activists of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) in the peace talks, and other political prisoners here in Camp Bagong Diwa, staying with many others in the militants and heartfelt greetings to accompanied Jose Maria "Joema" Sison in his 5th birthday this February 8, and above all of his 155 years of service to the people and leaving the Spanish movement. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Over the span of more than five decades now, the red carpet of the economists, cultural, political and cultural and struggle, not only to the Iraqi forces and citizens in the country, but also in the whole world. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. His contributed to many progressive and leaving the forces. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. It is also big, in particular, and he continued to help me until present. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. In the middle of 1971, due to the dismay of what I discovered in a person being part of the management team in the company that I expected to be the one who will report the national indings, however, I decided not to work with the opportunists, and instead give my ability to raise the lives and development of the people. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. I resigned and interviewing, conducting a deep research and civic research by reading the authors and to interview the people in order to think about my whole self and entire life. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. I do not have an immediate tra in the study of the radical writing about the society in the Philippines and the world, including the proposed solutions to the problems in the Philippines and economists of the people. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Some of the sules that have been condemned and sharp in the situation of the country and the people, and to being known and deep in the rise of solutions to the deep and existing problems of the people and society are the partnership of Ka Joema who Struggle for the National Democracy and (in alias "Amado Guerrero") Philippine Society and Revolution, even the communist Party of John Eaton. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. I am particularly pointed at the author of Ka Joema because I discovered that it was an immediate benefit from the current situation and struggle of the Filipino people, while I also give time to the many classified author of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Mao and other deep who were scrutinizing the situation of their respective countries and the world. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. After I attended the different discussion, cycle of studies and demonstrations in the country (including activists and protesters), I was completely convinced that the movement for national democracy should be complete -- as I learned about the partnership between Ka Joema. That's why I decided to allocate my time and life to the current national democratic movement and leaving the colonial jackpot. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. It did not last long when I personally recognized Ka Joema. There are times when we meet Ka Joema to discuss the particular activities I played. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. But I was arrested (in the first time) in the early part of 1974 and was released after three years -- after Amnesty International revealed the crimes of the attack of the regime of Marcos against our political prisoners, and wrote that we filed complaints from these kinds of crimes of the torur. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Ka Joema then was arrested (in November 1977) in La Union. He experienced brutality, and, in the entire time of being jailed in the martial law, he was in a dungeon in Fort Bonifacio and was severely placed in cruel restraint. He needs to go to the wall of his cell just to talk to other political prisoners who are also barolina in the left and right part of his cell. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. What is more important, even in the strict condition of detensions, Ka Joema has been writing to the best in the political movement -- with the assistance and playing with his wife, Ka Juliet, his tags and partner in writing, which gave importance and helped in the national movement. The most sharp is the criticism of some of the laughing matter of scientific research (including the referendum), and the "Regularization counter-offensive" and the "Regularization of the Year), and the" Regularization of the New Houses of the country), and the "Regularization counter-offensive" and the "Regularization counter-offensive" and the "Regularization counter-offensive" and the "Regularization counter-offensive" and the "Regularization of the Year), and the" Regularization counter-offensive "and the" Regularization counter-offensive "and the" Regularization counter-offensive "and the" Regularization of the Year), and the "Regularization counter-offensive" and the "Regularization counter-offensive" and the "Regularization counter-offensive" and the "Regularization of the New Houses of the country), and what is more important, and criticism of the country's digital strategy during that time. He moved from the prison and in the first peace talks between the Duterte and the government's big business, he criticized the administration's handling of the peace talks before and asked him about how to bring him. His partnership about bringing him has been handling it since he became a founder of the peace panel panel of NDFP. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The success of the campaign is flaws in the national national movement, the actual situation and the next advancement and progress has been confirmed by the critics that will be started by Ka Joema. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. After he was freed in the involvement of the martial law, together with some other leaders of the political prisoners, we are giving up to the residence of Ka Joema in an apartment in La Loma, Quezon City. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. In some of our meeting, one of those who united is the form of the Nationalist Party (PNB), the founder of the Nationalist Party (PNB), the ruling party-list. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Ka Joema is the chairman of the Preparatory Committee of PNB, however, because of the earlier action, he needs to leave because of the series of activities in other countries. It was elected before Rolando "Ka Lando" Oxia, chairman of Kilusang May Day, and he became even in the chairman of founder. I am the general Secretary before. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The PNB was quickly organised in the entire country and was able to win several positions in congress and local in the following election. Since then, it was experienced by a more serious murder and other serious violation of human rights, including the murder of Ka Lando and murder and attempted murder of many other leaders of PNB, staff and supporters. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The lives and safety of other leaders of PNB, personnel and supporters were put in danger even if the updates and offices will not be safe to transfer. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. I have no other options but to act on a secret, which is often allowed to support and care for the filipino workers and farmers. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. In the case of Ka Joema, he is obliged to maintain the iron sheets in other countries. However, he will not leave the referendum which states the implementation of the regime even if he is in another country. This is always a threat to his life and security. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The government has already made the state even the filing of various criminal cases against Ka Joema. The Inter-Agency Legal Action Group of the Arroyo regime is always busy with reducing the deed of criminal cases against Ka Joema and other leaders of the national movement. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. With the conspiracy of the indignation of the US and the next boet of the regime in his country, the Ka Joema is placed on the list of "teamrista" Ka Joema, which is why he is nerable to arrest and harassment. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. In the last part of August 2007, the US and the acquet of the Arroyo regime took place on the conspiracy to arrest and let him have a Dutch woman. Confiscated were documents, computer disks and other file of Ka Joema and the leaders of NDFP. Because the Dutch court has no sufficient basis for him to be jailed, he was released after 16 days and returned the file but the file was broken. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Even during that time, Ka Joema is undergoing threats and harassment, Ka Joema is not shaken by the continuation of her work and leaving the struggle of the people and leaving the world. The centered on and view of the local and global situation and the discussion is clear of the growing strategies and tactics, in long term struggle and the rich's rich and leaving the same time. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Aside from the continued translation and conservative leadership of the National League of People's Struggles, an interactive organization whose goal is to back up the masses and comprehensive organizations in the whole world. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. He is also considering the need to strengthen the involvement of the emerging parties and improve the national communist Party. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. All of these efforts and activities of Ka Joema is proof that the prison and the esticerosion of the Eclipse will not be enough to make the basic goods like Ka Joema. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. His hard work, work hard, work and success will continue to guide and give inspiration to our political prisoners who are leaving the colonial and more especially in the outside of Correctional facilities. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

Almost 2,000 years have passed when a group of people came closer to Jesus Christ, and there is an opportunity to try him and be put in shame, with the latest request for Him to show a sign to truth that he is the one he gives Him. His reply, written in Matthew 16: 2-3, is not similar to what they expected. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. 2, he replied and responded to them: When you have been placed under pressure, you have been placed under the time: Because the sky is red. " We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. 3 At in the morning, "on this day, it will be a hurricane season: Because the sky is red and threatening." You are hypocrites, you will inspect the face of heaven, but you will not scrutinize these signs of times. " We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Jesus is only good at many great miracles, and they have no trace of assumption that they were aware. The evidence is there, but they are rejected to accept it. That is why they called the right thing for them - hypocrites and deceitful people. And he informed them the result of their lack of belief. The lack of spiritual understanding, that Jesus Christ mentioned to them, they managed to blind to what they should see. The proof of the weather is there, however, they opted not to deny it. They continue to sleep, sleeping, and finger pointing to sleep. Too blind, deaf, and pipi. In spite of the scattered truths in their surroundings. We're going to get a lot MORE.

Even Vice President Leni Robredo is against this plan. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. I think the proposal of former Senate President Aquilino "Nene" Pimentel is more beautiful in the town of Batac, Ilocos Norte to bury the remains of Marcos. According to Pimentel, he loves the people there in Batac so it is better that he will be buried there to stop several years of debate about this issue. For me, Marcos should not be buried in the Libingan ng mga Bayani. Marcos is known in the whole world as one of the leaders of the country with the biggest stolen from the government. He is known as a implemented law where thousands of Filipinos lost and killed by military and police. Is it a heroes who stole billions of billions in funds of the country? We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Is it being considered as a leader who has already killed our freedom and agreed to the left murder of those who expressed resistance to the peace negotiations. Until now, the Marcos family is not yet buried their stolen from our country. Until now, justice is still screaming for thousands of families who lost their relatives during martial law.

Even once, the Marcos family did not even apologize and apologized for the sin that they did to our country. Is this kind of leadership what we want to make an example for the next generation of Filipinos? We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Hopefully not.

They were shocked when the Pope's communications of the Australian priest was published in favor of gay marriage. It seems that they are going to celebrate that the Roma became liberal because of Pope Francis but - they suddenly became confused when a priest penalizes in an issue related to homosexuality. This is a proof or indication that their assumption is wrong in the true message of the Pope. That's why we are practicing Catholic, let us not simply believe the colorful stories about our faith. Let us know the source, and then we will read or watch the entirety of our beloved Pope Francis.

The Manila Police District has a lead to catch those who were conducting hazing to Servando, sophomore student of De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde. The three companions of Series, students of said school, are recovering in the Philippine General Hospital. They are still alive to solve the case. They should be guarded by the authorities and implemented the witness protection program. According to the police report, after hazing, they were just dropped in a condominium in Manila. It is appointed Alpha Kapor Rho (AKHO) to recruit the victims. Every time the start of school starts or the classes are not passed in a whole year, it is impossible that there is no student who is reported to be victims or killed in hazing. At the time, violence among young people will "not be seen on the streets but in schools and university." Even the soreness goes by the cruel ritual. There are many reasons why there are young people who are sabotaging the fraternity: To be a cool; magooon with new gangs; and have protection in bullying by some groups. Although there is a law against hazing that RA 8049 passed in 1991 after the death of Leni Villa, student of Ateneo de Manila School of Law, the violent and heinous murders under the said ritual continues.

Hazing are also widespread even in institutions that are said to have a high level of teaching. According to Senator Tito Sotto, the killer of hazing will continue if the Department of Justice (DOJ) will not be resolved. "One of the previous hazing incidents have been solved. The DOJ should put more effort in the prosecution of these cases. Otherwise, there will be more deaths to come. " There is no ability or it seems that the state does not want to punish those responsible for hazing. The fraternity, particularly in the legal profession, will continue to refuse to punish the "siblings" who were sentenced to form. The case of Leni Villa lasted for 20 years before his family served justice. Violence and brutality should not be allowed or promoted to groups or brotherhood. The management of the university and student councils should act on the formation of advocacy and campaign which will instruct the students to avoid the monster brotherhood. Stop hazing!

The problem is, numbers game or paramedics in the House and Senate should rule and not the nutrients of the case. Right or wrong, yeally or bosses, no fault. And he will remain in position. In this situation, the children's children will remain in the care of the people and the people will suffer the situation. A big problem is a big problem in filing an impeachment case. First, who will file a case? Second, if the discussion is record, Butch Abad does not want to release papers about DAP. How about the evidences that will be used in the case? Is the documents and testimony used by the SC in making decisions about DAP? To who will file a case, the senators are not reliable because they are 20 of them to receive huge amount of DAP.

What do we know that in the two-year tournament of the minds of DAP, they will be replaced with all the judges in the SC and will be in favor of them the decision in the end? He, he, he! DAP, the people of Malacanang and their allies are brave enough to fight their enemies in the SC because the SC himself released a decision that the DAP was not constitutional. Because it is not constitutional, they will still be forced to continue the use of DAP. What they will just avoid is what is against the Constitution which is done in DAP. Part of this is the drumming of money from the agencies and use it in other goals. They will also avoid making laws about taking and spending money in the country without the blessing of the Congress. They should not allocate funds to pulled out from anywhere to answer the project under the programmed fund.

Freddie usually drink alcohol while picking up the amount of payment that he sold for five pesos per piece. We get in the mountain for three days and we are just sleeping.

Even if he is not using it, it is just leftover food. But our reminder to her aunt of my brother-in-law has not been proven by the doctors.

MATERIAL_BASE-1B_49204943 Hour sibling: Sipping the situation of Special Education in the country We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. By Eclipse Rufina Plamenco We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. "Ate, when will you go home?" My younger sister Yodney was shouting and repeatedly asked when we talked to the telephone just past. More than a month has passed before we talked again, so as my romance, she has been answering several times. When he got tired, he returned the phone to my Mother without permission from me. The entire family was very happy when Yodney was born. It is different from their brother's color, he inherited the white and smooth skin of his Mother. To our siblings, he is the only one who has a deep breath on both cheeks. But to all of us, it was the only one trying to grow up like ordinary children. He was three years old when the symptoms started to appear: Sometimes, he was suddenly minor volcanic activity of no reason, cannot speak properly, and seems to understand what the surrounding him is saying. Subsequently, we found out that Yodney was a Special child. Nevertheless, I did not think that he became a burden in my life. It is true that he is still restless every time there are visitors in the house, but he is always staying in the computer and watching YouTube videos. Sometimes, I will be surprised that he will be happy and washing our clothes. Yodney spent eight years on Sunday. In every smile, our family will be moved to tears through ordinary people - to study in a school, have friends, and face sadness and happiness in life. The first step in 1999 advised the doctor to study Yodney in private schools in Manila offering Special Education (SPED), to improve his condition. That's why when he was four years old, he was transferred to our parents from Samar. Divided the SPED in two types of students: Mentally gifted; and children with disabilities such as blind, pipi, deaf, and with developmental disorder like my sibling, according to Ma'am Mirla Olores, SPED Division Chief of the Department of Education (DepEd). It is not the same to find schools with cheap tuition and proper facilities for Special children in the Philippines. In fact, in more than five million Special children in the country, more than 230,000 are also able to study the SPED, according to the record of DepEd. The Mother says, they were even lost in searching for schools near our house. In the end, Yodney entered a private school in Ortigas, up to 600,000 tuition per year. The family could not bear the expensive tuition, so Yodney was transferred to another school in Mandaluyong. Even before the first, the expenses are still heavy in the pocket. In 2004, my sibling needed to go home to Samar. Second in the five-year study of Yodney in the private school, he learned to mention his name, bumasses, wrote, holding a spoon and fork, and subsequently, formed a simple sentences. In 2010, we put him in a public SPED center in Samar a few months. When I once secured Yodney, I thought about the condition of other children who were not able to study in a better school. Will each other be given attention? For example, Yodney says some of his teachers suddenly came out of the classroom to play. It is said that my sibling is smart, right to answer when asked. There is no consideration for the 381 public SPED centers in the whole country, but cannot hide the shortage of these teachers that will focus and be equipment. Not all SPED centers in the country have equipment for every kind of disability, says Olores. Even if the SPED Division of DepEd wants to evade their services, they are still having a hard time brought about by the authorities that can't be addressed by the government. According to Olares, although they've aligned the budget of the SPED this year to 12.80 billion from 12.15 billion in 2012, it remains lacking in order to increase every public SPED centers in the entire country or to buy valuable items such as Braille writer for the blind. In the experience, the facilities in private schools with sufficient teachers - as if only those with money only have a chance to lighten the studies of the "espeyal" loved ones. The last choice aside from a small budget and lack of teachers and professionals, there is also the issue of rightly pointing at the Special children. A sincere training for teachers is needed about the right teaching and dealing with different cases of Special children, additional UP Cc SPED Department Head Dr. Edilberto Dizon. "The one of those who prompted me to study the SPED is because my child is a Special child... most of us are studying because of our loved ones," said Kristina, a doctoral student of the SPED at UP College of Education (UP. C). But Professor Myra Tantengco of copc said that most of the work of other countries will still prefer where wages are bigger. From 2005 to 2010, there were 2,768 Filipino teachers flew to the United States, where the teachers of the SPED, according to the National Statistics Coordination Board. Olores added that the therapists of Special children working for the public SPED centers in the whole country can be counted among the fingers. Compared to P130,000 pesos per month of salary of teachers in the US, the teachers received in the country are small, less than P18,000. "But we are urging our students to serve the Special children here in the country," says Tantengco. Meanwhile, the SPED Department of UP planned to lay down the administration of UP to have a educated "inclusive" for special students at university. "We believe that the education of the Special children in UP will benefit if they will be included in the regular scholar of the country," Dizon said. The preparation and big courses will be spent for this, says Dizon, but if the UP and the government will focus on this, this is a step that will open education at university for all. As a university of the country, it will serve as a good example that the UP considers the proper action that can be followed and imitate other institutions of education. However, it will only lead to failure in any desire to improve the SPED in the country if the overall condition of the justice system remains tragic. With the continuing and diplomatic order of the government in the education sector, it cannot be avoided that even the SPED is often based on private schools. After all, a small gift to the birthday of my sibling is to study and write articles about her condition. Until now, we are still hoping that the day will be experienced by Yodney to live normal, and study in a cheap but dequality school, where he can learn how to learn and will discover the mystery of life. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

In June 1913, this is the place where the mandin Takatg led by Datu Amil to the American soldiers and Moro Scouts (Maguindanao and Maranao) headed by General John Pershing. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. More than 500 children and women were included in the fight here before the American troops attacked the Taxg in less than four days of fighting. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. As if I am afraid to enter my mind the so many victims of violence in the fight that happened. That is also one of the reasons why the manders of Taxg landed. There are a few of the families who bring their babies to the summit to offer prayers as tradition. Their respect for the historic place is that big. For me, I have the same respect for those who have died here like Datu Amil who died when his group finally lost in the fight. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. I do not feel nervous but I feel different from my new area of operations (ao). I am not afraid of like Radrain Sahiron but my respect for my achievements. Just imagine, with the amount that he has passed, he is still survive! He is a nuisance to it and it seems like she has an Agimat. He is a grown fighter. Even if they closed his eyes, they know where the soldier attacked the place. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. A severe challenge entered his territory. We should also be cunning. We should think about his strategy. I do not know what he looks because it is unlikely that the picture showed us to the Brigade headquarters in Busbus. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. "Just, that is only one hand. That is old and always riding a horse. "This is less than 50 of his colleagues there in the area," said one INTEL Guy, a brief admission. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Actually, the information given to me is still unlikely. There is no clear in what is called Commander's Information Requirements (CIR). If that kind of available data is unlikely, we implement the strategy according to those who have studied in going to war. Bottomline: The rangers singer and he did not have a target of the enemy. The joke is a joke but courageous old rangers, "Pictures of war, brain use, don't ut it!" We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. In what I see, there are two points of the troops of Radrain Sahiron if compared to my personnel, most are 'Baby Musangs' (Non-rangers / SROC graduate). First, is the battle experience. As they say, they have a form of fight. Like Radrain is the beginning of his season as MNLF fighter, he is fighting. His fight that was experienced will not be measured. He just seemed to have a game with him. Second, they are only in the Eclipse of the terrain. Even if there is no map, they can vigate the place. They know each ambush site, water points and observation posts. If the soldiers are going to go to school, they are just being shot at a target paper. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Meanwhile, my unit will not be last. My Team Leaders are also battered in the fight in Surigao and Basilan. I invest in the combat leadership of my BO-Leaders and of course with my own abilities to send them to their own abilities. Then, we should win that we are well-off in Basic education skills. Within days, we repeated the knowledge of movement techniques / formations, tracking operations, survival techniques, patrol base operations and immediate action drills (IAD) like the scenario of counter-ambush techniques. We also know how to take a fire procedures and close air support (CAS) operations if these are needed during the pitch. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. An addition to it, we are just in the markmanship skills. The common shooting skill level of my soldiers is the ability to throw at the distance of 250m. I have Pili, soldiers who can register the head shot at a distance of 500 meters. My troop was also able to shoot a meeting with our lessons that are quick in the fire. Most of all, we have a salary, free hospitalization and different benefits that are not in the ranks of the bandits. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Wait, we also have another lead. We are the Good guys who are biased by the single God. Yes, we are the same enemies that we pray and ask for guidance to God. Because kidnapping, rape and beheading of innocent victims is what they are doing, it is likely that Satan will hug them. There, we are just sure. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. "Do not be afraid of them. "God is on our side," I remind myself when we gathered together for our mission Planning. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Because I noticed, everything is serious every time we bet our lives in a mission. Anyone with the disappointment of others, the word '2-week mission' is not fulfilled at Jolo! We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

"Every time there is a danger area (place that is possible to have an enemy), the surroundings should be better and set up always watching elements." We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. I also have a great reminder to them not to register with the feeling of exhaustion. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

It is only dead that you are tired. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Because of that, every time we enter the danger like low ground or creekline, there is a need to guard at the back. We need to change in monitoring and teasing that come in position even if it is hot or there are vnik or various aspects of the blood there. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. My aim at Bud landed. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

Not only because the trip towards Davao City is long and complicated, but because this became the center of calamity, of the devastation of typhoon Pablo, last December 2012. And he has not recovered until now. Although it is a natural calamity to hit the place, it has been a long time since the calamity has been run over by a calamity that has done: Negligence of the government, a lack of social, severe presence of the military. After being visited by typhoon Pablo, the calamity happened, many people have made it: There are allegations that they have taken from those affected. Including the temporary residence of the victims, it was reported that the fashions were paid. Meanwhile, the local government is almost not working, the military has already ruled. This is what a fact-finding is the humanitarian mission that went to the place recently. Riding three buses from Davao City, taken by the people who were up to 76 people, including nuns, doctors, nurses, psychologist, forester and others who want to help the long, complicated trip to Baganga. Included here are the public servants, including Pinoy Weekly. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Going to Baganga at first, the bus runs fast. The haystack is cemented and is still paved. The scenery is beautiful and pleasing. But while getting away from Davao City and approaching the towns destructed by the typhoon, the scenery is changing. Although the path from the spread of the storm is clean, it is still visible in the roads of this town. Both sides of the haystack sparkles. From the sparkle on the roof of the houses that was taken by a strong wind in the height of the storm. There is a new exchange for the roofs. There was a huge collision in some assigned the new house. Even the crops such as banana, are starting to fruits, some of them are packing up, green-green with some wide rice fields. The victims who have given the hand in asking for help is also gone. But afterwards, we learned: They were still there, in their respective communities, struggling. Even far away, the glitter of the galvanized iron of the iron sheets is slowly broken. She was replaced with color-white cloth. Tolda is being distributed by organizations and the roof of the residents. Many also use old tarpaulins as roof and walls. The tent cities in some towns where the group passed. Also, many of the trees fell down, especially the trees. They were still sprawled on the side of the wake and the mountains. The report made by the three buses made a lot. Exchange of mud and dust, the road is not cemented. The flow of buses are also slow because of the slow road. This is part of Compostela Valley to adjacent the town of Cateel towards Baganga. Here, the group passed through a depiction of the military. The group was not executed, it looks like the soldiers were surprised by the passing of three buses. Because others are taking a bath in the face of the road and others are seated and just standing on the right. "This is where," the house was burned, "said one contestant who is a member of the human rights group. Others asked: "Will we stop?" "No, we're just footage of the house that was burned." The bus was minor. The people inside the bus pointed at their camera, and went viral. "Going to be held, let us leave," said the people of the military, even if it is dusty. The soldiers were not able to do anything, they were just watching over the buses. But one, quickly ran towards their camp as a school. It is likely to be reported to those "higher." The three buses continue to take the fins on the road. Drivers make sure that the gap between buses will not be apart. Because aside from the road, it is also the side of the ravine. But more than two hours have passed, the course of the bus has improved, the flow of bus has improved, and the path is cemented, but the way the buses suddenly stopped. This sexuality of the 67th Infantry Batallion of the Philippine Army. The group is already in the town of Cateel Dispatching of Barangay. They will need to adjust. "The boys," ordered by a military that was strapped to the shoulders of the armalt and banded with bullets. The men went down together with the nuns and leaders of the stronghold in Mindanao. The negotiation started, while a soldier climbed up the bus. He looked at her, it was not known if he was looking for something. He will need to rest on the chairs and the left people inside the bus. All of them are soldiers, wearing full battle uniform but there were no plate. The nuns and other negotiators said the motive of the group, going to Baganga and will give relief goods and medical services as well as the group's condition of the victims of the typhoon. The negotiation lasted. The soldier's leader said: "Pasurgency is just jobs." He added that the group will wait for their appointed officer and there is a request to pass the boy. It is time to allow the group to pass through. But before this, a motorcycle quickly ran away from depicting. And almost 25 meters from the sexpoint, in the first hit way, a soldier who was riding a motorcycle was blocked by a logging truck. The military ordered the truck driver to take his vehicle in the road. After that, the driver quickly ran to the military, taking the key of the truck. Aside from the spread of logs in front of the truck and the small space between the truck and the police it did not speak. The contestants were forced out of the mission to carry the gs and remove the logs for the buses to pass through. The nuns led in carrying; everything was help.

The Catholic bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) commented on the failure of the administration of President Benigno Simeon Aquino III to raise the quality and level of the lives of the people but it is saddening that revealing it seems to be a result of revenge than love in the country. According to a statement of CBCP recently, the steps of the current administration lacks to stop corruption, spread of crime and ease the poverty of the country. Even the bishops have said the ongoing violation of human rights and extrajudicial killing. They also said, the human rights of the people for certain jobs, decent houses, akses of the right and cheap medicines, de quality education and rights to inherit the land farming (jab in Hacienda Luisita,) while it creates new rights (statement on the RH Law but it is an "unexpected acceptance of this). They also criticized the failure of the administration to pass the Freedom of Information Bill that will give way to research and the transactions that the government entered. The administration is very funny in the FOI when its government program is "straight path." "Why are they afraid to hand over the people the truth behind their leadership? I cannot say anything wrong with the criticism of CBCP because those are true. However, what I wonder is that this is also the problems we are facing during the time of the regime of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo but why did they have no reaction to this? I remember that if the people are calling for many times for this letter of the Aquino regime but it remained parked in their pluma. Their mouth is shut despite the corruption that circulated at that time, instead of dancing to Macapagal (like dancing to the dictator Ferdinand Marcos in the first part of the time of his dictatorship). It can be recalled that some of these will receive a lot of favor from Macapagal, like an example of the grand Sports Utility vehicle (SUV) Mitsubishi Montero (which brought back). That's why the statement of CBCP is obvious that it is just revenge with the current administration especially if it was noticed that only when failing to stop the passing of the Reproductive Health Bill that pushed for President.

President Rodrigo Duterte wiped the failure of the operation wherein 44 members of the Special Action Force of the Philippine National Police were killed while they are being hunted by the Indonesian bomber, Zulu fi Binhir alias Marwan last January 25, 2015 or two years ago. It is because President Duterte is not satisfied with the result of the investigation that they discussed at the Lower House. The style is that the police, military and MILF have their own responsibility, so until now there is still no clarity on who is really responsible for the lives of the killed police. Duterte has a kind of operation which is said to be the operation of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of America that the blame should be sent to former President. Noynoy Aquino and former PNP Chief General Alan Purisima due to hiding two men from the people are the whole truth in the tragedy that killed 60 people, including 44 commandos who are members of the SAF. The truth is, when the said tragedy happened, we strongly believes, even the other of our colleagues in the media, in the statement of former President Noynoy, that they are being hunted by the Indonesian bomber alias Marwan in a secluded area in Mamasapano, Maguindanao. But the knowledge of everyone is anxious and has no own decision to ask one of the AFP officials who asked what he will do after reaching him that the 44 police commandos of the SAF-PNP who were sent to hunt Marwan were killed. Aside from Noynoy and Purisima also implicated by President. Duterte is the former DILG Secretary. Mar Roxas, why did he let the 44 SAF killed and why did he not waste anything to give justice to the murder of them.

Despite this, the TNT Katfriends changed and sent home to Mario! Where can you see that? Isn't it easy? Other teams were able to hit and have a hard time to rise in the standings but still not changing the import. But the Tropang Texters are in a different class! They are really decided to succeed in the Governors Cup. Because coach Joseph USC thinks that the TNT Katfriends will not be brought to the finals. The import might only be until the start when you are predictable! Because, he is the one who has the most low-average of ten imports playing in the championship. He is also not powering as a bounder. But the TNT Katz wins in the first four games, isn't it? This success is due to the locals. Then, he honors as a player of the Game of Jayson Castro. IT's "almost double the numbers." Castro is less than a little bit more but he was able to domed the game. And if the situation is titled, the presumption of USC and the coaching staff of TNT Katfriends is surely right. So IT took Mychal Ammons to debut in the game against Blackwater Elite in Saado. Well, at the beginning of the game, the Tropang Texters caught the Elite. Blackwater will only stay in halftime. But this is a result of the incident that Ammons had to adjust and Castro did not play first. But in the Second half he went to Catsro and the game of Ammons, that is why the Blackwater will be crushed, 109-89 to remain clean the record 5-0. The Tropang Texters are now alone in the top of the standings after losing the Mahmoud in Phoenix last Friday. And USC does not regret the exchange done. Because he sees Ammons with a good future to make 16 points and beheading 18 rebounds against the Elite. Hopefully, this is not really regret for the TNT Katfriends because they have sent it home.

Not a siren in the sea, but siren, or hugely needed. Life is simple then.

Just one sound of the siren, we already know typhoon signal number 1. Two sound if the storm is stronger. And three if the storm is terrible.

In the last news, it is not just Surveillance ships and the fish ship of China was seen in Scarborough or Panatag Shoal. China has one big gun boat. War was in war. And our BRP Gregorio del Pilar has a corresponding reward to those who are also there. This means something. The two countries are both serious in their claim that the said island is their territory. China is a giant, the Philippines can't do anything if he has war with China because of this. And the Philippines can no longer do anything if he will first launch a war. Because, he did not even have a plane warship. This is a helor but it might not return to the exhaustion of gasoline in just going to the place. Most of the caskets were only flying because they were only thrown away from the bunk shop from the Vietnam war. This Navy is just one of the ships. And what is painful, it seems that these will run out of diesel or bunker Fuel, which is why it is the sea. Our coast guard are so vast to gain weight. They might be first to sink in a little bad weather rather than the boat that is being brought to a basin or pond. On the other hand, China has airplanes, ships and other weapons as well as the weapons of the Americans and Russians. With the number of their soldiers, they just pee, then, the Navy and coast guard might be followed. We are not single men, Bro. We only have toy guns. Where is Uncle Sam? The only hope is the help of Uncle Sam, of the Americans. They sold us by the warship BRP Gregorio del Pilar who also dug up from the dried shop. They are also selling us by armalt. They are also the ones selling us by those who are from the bunk shop also of helikes. And when we have a flying fighter plane, we also come from them. There's an actor calling on that plane. But some of the Americans are reconciliation with us to help the Philippines and the United States if there is a war with each other. That is why, the Philippines was sent to the Philippines in Korea, in Vietnam and in Iraq. It seems like the boxing of China and the Philippines is lurking in Scarborough Shoal. Despite this, the peace of the Americans is deafening. Maybe, they are deaf and blind to the government going to China and the Philippines that's why they have no reaction. But what is certain is that, the Philippines will not rely on help in the time of war. They have not even a cent of Americans to get carried away from us to help the Chinese. Now, do you look obvious, Bro? There is an exercise, now, Balikatan exercise. But the target is that those who do not agree with what we mentioned now. Child of tokwa, what is that? There should be no war even when, we do not want the war. Everyone should joke about diplomacy and peaceful dialogue. Even if we have a strong military force that will be influenced by four in China. Because if there is a war, funds will be consumed for the achievements of the people, our lives will be consumed and there will be many killings. Our lives will not be normal if we are all going to help the things that we will do and we also berates that this is also happening in China. Through the United Nations because we do not want to go out war in the Philippines, especially since the Scarborough Shoal is very close to us and we want a peaceful and assured relationship with other countries, the government of President Noynoy Aquino is moving to filing a corresponding case in the United Nations. Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea or USLOS, we have the right to Scarborough Shoal to inherit this. This is due to the jurisdiction of 200 mile exclusive economic zone according to USLOS. The Philippines will file a complaint against China so that the international court needs to be decided on the case. There is only a problem. What if China does not want to cooperate. Is it possible to decide the corresponding court of the UN in favor of the Philippines? Because the court is really hard to decide when they would not allow the enemy. With the criminal case, the court will only decide if the opposing sides appear. The problem is if they are not charged, that is why the case has been archive. The government shows that there will be a case against this proposed exemption in the Philippines and China and won the first in the case.

MATERIAL_BASE-1B_55336751 The 82-year-old history of the CEGP We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. As an exceptional and oldest alliance between the country, the College Editors Guild of the Philippines (CEGP) celebrated their 82-year anniversary of writing, fighting, and on the side of this year. Since it was established on July 25, 1931, history became a witness in a few decades of fighting the CEGP inside and outside the university. It started with four pubs before, the group has reached more than 700 yards from more than 60 provinces in the country at present. In its long history, the CEGP has represented individuals to recognize the Country in a different field. Some of them are Helena Benitez, Renato Constantino, Abran Sarmiento Jr., Antonio Tagamolila, Emmanuel Lachey, Ma. Lorena Barros, Armando Malay, Lourdes Simbrain, Isagani Yambot, Satur Ocampo, Teodoro Casino, and many others. And most of this, interfering is ongoing - and not witnesses - exactly the CEGP in forming the history of fighting the people. On the condition of the site that won, like in the past few seasons, the campus press will be facing threats and challenges. According to Marc Lino Abila, the national general secretary now of the CEGP, they recorded more than 250 violations of freedom in journalism at the University of San Carlos in Cebu City this April. Some of them were libelled by Jesusa Paquins, head of UP Outcrop of the University of the Philippines - Baguio, due to the alleged blog article two years ago. "The court issued a warrant for Paquins in August last year where he managed to post bail from the donations of organizations and friends for his temporary freedom. The case is currently being heard, "according to Abila. The CEGP also shared the libel case against Roque Dawn of the University of the East because of its lamb issue. They collect the publication fee of the administration since last year (2012). Earist Technozette is facing "Amang" Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology (EARIST) in the threat to close the tour since March if the adviser is not accepting the administration for them. "It was stated in the memorandum released by the administration that the adviser has the power to interfere with all aspects of the restrictions from choosing the person who knows that it is a limit to the use of funds for the curriculum," according to Abila. The operation of the Philippine Artisan of Technogical University of the Philippines (TUP) -Manila is temporarily suspended because of a blind item, the director of the student affairs of TUP-Manila has been identified. The staff also had a difficult time to enact its staff, which were all critical writers on the policy at university. "We also face the editorial staff of pubs. It also serves as a burden to the condition of the pubs that their student enrolled in the condition of a lifetime against them, "according to Abila. Removed from the process of the publication fee is The Chronicler of Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) -Taguig today. The administration is also not recognized as an official who will vote for The Chronicler. There is also a threat to close the custody of the University of Cagayan Valley. The CEGP has already filed a complaint against the Commission on Higher Education in Cagayan. They continue to talk to the administration at present. The screening of the publication fee of the students is The Angelite of Holy Angel University (HAU) in Pampanga from the removal of the administration who collected the money they collected in 2011 because of the release of the law that they collected in 2011 because of the release of the government. "Even the other pubs of students inside the HAU became a manual that they collect because of this. They collected money that they collected for the operation of pubs since it resulted in low numbers that were being published in newspapers for students, "according to Abila. Target against insurgement Dati, the military accused the organisations like the CEGP as a taste of armed rebels in the Philippines. Once he clearly accused him or a member of the guilder of the New People's Army (NPA). It was year 2005 under Oplan Bantay Laya when the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) stated that "Knowing Thy Enemy" stated that the NPA will consider the CEGP. This is still ongoing under the Oplan Unity of Aquino, according to the CEGP. He has received many reports of harassment from its members. Even its officials in the national anthem of the CEGP is receiving harass. "February last year when Surveillance experienced Surveillance of the CEGP in Samar. Its officials followed up to the house of a gua (call to a member of the CEGP) to take the night off. "They know that they are in danger then that is why they are controlling what they know from the media," according to Abila. Marc Lino Abila, current secretary-general of the CEGP. (Pher Pasion) according to them, there is a man asking the other house if they are there. They were not able to sleep all night because of fear. They were helped by the members of the National Union journalist of the Philippines (NUJP) in Samar to be safe to deliver the airport. Karl Doceo, vice-president for Visayas of the CEGP, explains why the members of the pubs were included in the order of the military's order from the copy they obtained. "A staff of Earist Technozette was followed by suspected agents of the military. While the staff was allegedly walking, he was asked by the following him if he was a member of the country. He denied that he is a member of the country because of fear and told him that he will not follow him, "according to Abila. The Pioneer of Palawan State University (PSU), reports that the AFP has issued a referendum to their school, saying that the members of the CEGP will be released. The selection of staff of the pubs were also specified. As well as the report of those from Cagayan Valley. Abila added that in their very celebration of the 82 anniversary of the CEGP, they have identified the agents following them since the morning. They were followed by them until the venue of celebration in Visayas Avenue, Quezon City. CJA scrap in spite of the harassment and threats to the campus press, the fight of CEGP is ongoing on blogging on freedom in journalism. Abila added that the use of the campus Journalism Act of 1991 (CJA of 1991) of schools continue to suppress those who won. The CJA was approved in 1991 to protect the restrictions that won. But in the implementation of the law, the opposite happened according to the CEGP. "Yes, there Are positive content on the law. But the lack of penalty clause or punishment for those who violate the administration is giving strength to the administration to use the CJA of 1991. If the admin wants to close down or collect the publication fee, or suspending a campus journalist because of its partnership, they can do it because they will not be punished by this law, "according to Abila. The CEGP is being endorsed by the CJA of 1991 and the laws of the campus Press Freedom Bill of Kabataan Party-list in Congress. But this will not be enough to stop the violations of the site that won, according to Abila. The campus Press Freedom is going to be a big help if they will enter laws. But even this, it will not stop the campus press freedom, as long as the educational situation is as long as the farmers, the farmers, have no land, as long as the political crisis, cultural and economists of crisis in society, "according to Abila. History of interfering in the motto of the CEGP, "To write is already to choose" (Ang writing is one of choosing) the long experience of narrowing and on the ranks of the citizens. According to its members, the CEGP has long shattered the "mile of another, sexuality or" tivity "in journalism. According to Abila, these kinds of violations against the society that demonstrates the issues in schools is ongoing. He said, the national issue is not separated from the issue at university so the journalists should not be separated from society. "If we lessen the budget of education, will increase the bills, they will report on the site that won and does not want to show it on the administration. Even in private schools, because for the education, various bills are squeezed by the students. This post (this) of campus journalists. "What now (this) of admin no matter how long IT is," according to Abila. According to Abila, the experience of the pubs that can be applied when it becomes critical for the contents of the services of the issues inside and outside of the university. "At present, there are still those saying that journalists should not be biased. But experience and history are given to us who truly have to change in society. And if you stay in the middle or position of those who get abuse and oppression, in the urgency, you are taking advantage and oppression, "according to Abila. We're going to get a lot MORE.

MATERIAL_BASE-1B_76379340 ISPORT!: POC election push through? By Zaldy Perez November 15, 2016 while the POC elections are approaching November 25, the worry or doubts will push through if this will push through. The dates were also set by the Senate committee hearing in the leadership of Fighting Senator Manny Pacquiao "in aid of copation" in the alleged intimidated funds given to the POC of PSC, which is reaching 13.6 million from 2010 to this year. Senator Pacquiao will be heard anymore, by the virtue of the filed resolution of Senator Sonny Angara, to be disqualified from ABAP President Ricky Vargas to run as an opponent of Peping Cojuangco in being led by POC. Cojuangco is aspiring for his fourth term. Angara says in the resolution of Angara, it is important to give clarity on the two issues because it is affected by the development of the Philippine sports which produces our "national pride, inspiration and instruments in the Nation-building." In the opinion of Vargas's camp and when the majority did not have the reason to be disqualified from the ABAP president of the POC election committee, it is obvious that the incumbent President is on the side or side. The POC Comelec argues that Vargas failed to answer the "Active membership" in the General Assembly meetings provision under POC by-laws. One of the most important to wait is if the TRO will be put out (Temporary restraining Order) at the right time, timing on the day of election. According to Vargas's lawyer, they need a TRO so that they will be able to know who is right or wrong. It is also good to wait if this step of the camp of Vargas will lead to the sanction of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) like what happened to the Indian Olympic Association before because of the chaotic process of elections.

MATERIAL_BASE-1B_62356512 BINYKO... followers of Christ: Reflection for the Feast of the Lord's Baptism Year A - January 13, 2014 We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The year 2014 is the Year of Pictures or Year of the Laity. The "LATEY" is not the coming of the mass of late! The "laity" is those not included in those appointed or infamous as ministers such as diakono, priest and bishops. In other words, they are the "usual baptism" who can share the mission of Christ! Who should have been deceived? A catholic an old rich woman approached the priest and asked if his pet dog was baptism. The priest shouted, saying: "Woman, the baptism is only given to the people and not to animals! It is not possible that your pet dog is baptism! " The old man replied: "Is it that Father, it's a waste to donate a million pesos for the church. Never mind, d'I will just go to the church of Aglipay fabulous! "Simultaneously. Sarcastic, the priest and said: "A woman, come back... why did you say that your dog is a Catholic!!!" What is the meaning of the baptism for our christians? Although it is a big difference in the baptism that we accepted in the baptism given to Jesus by Juan Bautista, we can see it with the same lessons. The feast of the conversation with Jesus is called the second Egyptian because Jesus introduced himself again. If in the first ECB, he stated that he is the founder of the world in the second Estates, he introduced his "identity" as the "son I am glad of God" who joined our anticipated situation. This is the message of the feast today: First, Jesus who is the Son of God, who has no trace of sin, is joined in our marriage through accepting the baptism of Juan who is a baptism of regret! Second, with the revelation of Jesus, he started the mission to be referred to by the domination of God. And third, he stated that he is the one who is the one who is absolutely delighted by God. What is it pointing to us? First, we hope that we will appreciate our baptism, where we promised to turn our backs to the sin and live as the real Son of God's Father. Second, we hope that we are praying that we are Christians through a life who is decent and pleasing, let us try that in all moments, we will always be happy to be happy in front of God. It is easy to be a person but it is difficult to follow the people. We can also say that it is easy to be Christian but it is hard to be Christian. It is easy because water in the head is needed. It is difficult because it means that they do not want to help yourself and living like Jesus who is full of sacrifice and service to others. Hopefully, it is not just until "baptism of a Christian... Hopefully, we should be the real children of God, sibling of Christ, I am absolutely delighted by the Father! We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

So in 2011, PNoy appointed Villanueva to stop the said tonnes, but last week it was revealed by COA that the officials who were elected by PNoy will continue to steal from the said agencies. As a matter of fact, the COA paid 2.13B that the inhumane! This means, that Villanueva has not fulfilled his job as chairman of the governments Commission for GOC. The thing is, instead of admitting his being stupid or if there is still a left shame on the body, he should just resign from his position, well, that is why the Animal will escape. Just imagine, that GMA is still being blamed on the billion peso which is clearly seen in the administration of PNoy.

MATERIAL_BASE-1B_89777962 Is the "Filipino time"? We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. By Tomas U. Santos - January 30, 2014 We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Upon arriving at the technical meaning of time, only one should be followed by the standard. But if talking about the Filipino culture, the scheduled time may be later or not. What should be followed? On the first day of January, the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Attack, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Addtation (PAG-ASA) will run for a single standard of time in the whole country. This order is trying to change the tradition and it has been a resolution for the "Filipino time," a mind that is an hour of restricting activities or tasks. According to Mario Raymundo, the engineer of the Astronomical Observation and time Service Unit of PAG-ASA, one of the main objectives PhST is to prevent the negative connotation of the Filipino time from being too late at the time, wrong discipline, and nullified the time of our fellowmen. "What is often too late for things will cause many wasted opportunities, said Raymundo. According to Augusto De Viana, the chairman of the Department of history of the university, there is a good thing produced by the new one-time country. "We can save time and the Filipinos] will be productive in holding activities and other meeting because they already know when it will start and finish." Aside from this, it is just timely to change the negative consequences in order to cope with the Philippines in the study of neighboring countries. According to him, my professor is also an increase of Filipinos not only in the field of business or service in the country but also the real humane of each other. Meaning of the Filipino time, Jose Rizal also mentioned to his famous novels titled "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filming" the importance of Spaniards in their position by directly extending the occasions like the governor general and other personnel in the novel of Rizal. However, De Viana said that the negative definition of the Filipino time will never be considered as part of the culture of the country. According to him, the concept of the Filipino time came from the colonies of Spaniards in the country. From their frequent holding and gathering, Filipinos noticed that it is too late if the most important people in society have arrived. Because of this, the Filipinos had a resolution for the minds of the Filipinos that the most important thing will come. When the Spaniards left the country, Filipinos were able to get their practices to express themselves again to inform the majority of their importance. Since then, although it is early to wake up, those who are known and those who are capable of taking advantage of the arrival of different meeting or will be good. When the Americans are conquered the country, they noticed the latter of the Filipinos so they gave it a negative meaning that Filipinos do not know how to appreciate the time. They called it a "Filipino time," which has become a habit to use and became part of the Filipino culture. In the ASA as an official timeker several times a proposal implemented the government of the country to avoid the negative consequences in the Filipino culture. The Philippine Standard time (PhST) first started on June 2, 1977 through Presidential Decree Number 1149 by former President Ferdinand Marcos, saying that the PAG-ASA will be the official time service agency of the Philippines who is responsible for corruption. After the order was approved, the Law Pambansa Blg was immediately implemented. 8 in the year 1978 which was appointed in PAG-ASA as an official timeker of the Philippines. But although the law that will strengthen the PhST has long been implemented, it took 35 years before the implementation of a strong and critical law regarding this. This is the Philippine Standard time Act of 2014 that President Benigno Aquino III signed last December last year. Through this, all the clock in the country is isi in the official hours of PAG-ASA. A ratification of the campaign of PAG-ASA called "Juan time: Pinoy Ako, On-time Ako!" According to the National time Consumousness week that started the first day of 2014. This was done with the help of different organizations, particularly the mobile communications companies like Smart and Globe. "So now that since 2014, we hope there will be changes in the behavior of the Filipinos when they give importance to the time of their fellowmen," said Raymundo. The law is subject to all the national agencies of the Country - including state Universities and Colleges and government-owned and controlled corporations, all the local government units, all private stations, television and radio, and all private corporations or agencies in the Country. Even in Unidersidad, there is no reason for the people to be too late because there are GPS clock in buildings based on the atomic clock of PAG-ASA. According to Raymundo, the amount used for the implementation of this law depends on the General Appropriations fund of PAG-ASA. At present, they have paid 7 units in Malacañang and 4 units in PAG-ASA Regional Services Division. He said, the total project will require the celestial clock that costs more than 50 million to be implemented in the whole country. At present, the PAG-ASA wants to intensify the placing of time display in all establishments and buildings in Metro Manila where it is also a container of Network time protocol or what is called Global Possible System (GPS) where the common people will include their clock on PhST. The implementation of PhST is a big step to avoid the negative definition of the Filipino time. "We hope that this is the start of the proper use of PhST. This is also for the future of the Filipinos. "The time is important because this is calling for discipline, proper relationships, and the most important of all, this will be a sign for us to start giving importance and respect for the time of our fellowmen," he said. According to De Viana, it is not only the government to lead the fixing of "Filipino time," it is necessary to cooperate with every Filipino in order to be successful in the implementation of the "Philippine Standard time." "Let us remove the old concept of the Filipino time that is always pickled because it is not good for the country," he said. J.V. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

Teodoro, comprehensive intelligence and teacher of journalism, on his new essay "Writers and Public Intelltuals." It was said to have read a lot of writing in his speech "Interpreting the World: The writer as Public Intelevtual" in the bloggers of the Philippines of le Pen (Poets, Playwrights, Essenists, and Novelists). According to Teodoro, "not like Pilosyes This investigation, the intelligence could not be done in which he discovered and understood, let it be discovered by the future, when he did not let go of his duty to creating a future, that the foundation was to be helped by the present." There is an exact meaning, however, the prashing "public intelligence" in the US, where it came from and met. And he / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / According to scholar Russell Jacoby, who is one of those responsible for the creation of the prase, "means" the term] in general (roughly) of an intelligence community to discuss issues with general significance, a person who is writing not only for the professional journal but for the newspapers for all, "The Decline of American Intelltuals," 1989]. " It is obviously the second share of the decade "80 written and published in the research of Jacoby, because it is still focused on the print like newspaper and salt. In the continued spread of the television and after the Internet in the following decade, the "public intelligence" has been inclusion "by using these restrictions to send a wide public to the issues that they are involved in. With other things, it cannot be avoided, it has also corresponsive as a "famous" or celebrity. Based on the basis of this kind of meaning in "public intelligence," many can be determined in the country, both in Lewa, right and in the middle. But there is a public intelligence that is meaningful to pay attention: To fight Axel Pinpin. Interesante and useful to check what he is locked in as a public intelligence. Many were identified by Pinpin who was included in the "Tagaytay 5," activists in South Katagalugan who was illegally arrested, martyur and then imprisoned for more than two years of the government. After being freed, Pinpin continues to become a activists in South Dakota. In the ranks of activists, Pinpin is known for a poem. He was identified, perhaps more than the poem he was published and documentary, for poeters, rallies, night culture, awards, and others. He was prominent and permanent included in the countries that launched the activists and the citizens of South Katagalugan, together with the organisation of the ranks, copra makers, and of course, diving in different stages. He is like a special leader for activists. She is my favorite to invite in different gatherings so that he will get away. His reading, it is often welcoming the peace and at the end of the strong applause. Many were being taken by a picture with him and there were witnesses who also witnessed him by some fans, even if not minor. It is also my favorite to want and share, i-like and share, the poem on the internet. The amount of poetry is invaluable, especially in the ranks of the masses. "The theory," Karl Marx said, "is becoming a material force alongside his grip on the masses." And with what Pinpin was doing, they were asked to come near and the comprehensive theory of the masses - in a manner of revelation, clearly, and it can be remembered. There is a secret, because there are four of the issues and issues of the masses, at the time they are experiencing and at the time they are fighting in relation to it. Pinpin's poem is effective about the restrictions of the state, for example, not only because they were excellent as a poem. They are effective because they were reading in front of the filipino people who are fighting in the establishment, the demolition and even the dissolution of ranks in rally - and usually, at the time the wounds are still fresh. He was being humiliated and it will take a while to heal the wound, and that is why he continues to fight. Pinpin has already reached fame in the academic and supporting the duck duck; he has a poem on the MRT. But it is not associated with the growing fear and doubt of the comprehensive arts art in the west where their work will be like an image of Che Guards - in many missiles, source of system, and there is no radical message, and there is no danger to the rules. The centered critics of Terry Eagher then wrote: "There is a first understanding that he has to be sad and promote the American liberal and radical, because sore from the speed of the American liberal and radical, because her consciousness is sore from the speed that even the recent movement of art will be put in the entrance of the chemical Bank [The Sigurance of Theory, 1990]." But it is not violations for Pinpin and his message is not growing up - and also not saying it. The reason: He refused. Eagher said, "if your most beloved leaving the art can be eaten by the system, this means one thing: Not in not enough to become a Filipino masses, but... they do not have the real root of the Filipino masses of political and constitutional... The comprehensive director Lino Brocker said, he is not interested in creating the best Filipino films, but to creating the best Filipino viewers. Pinpin, not only involved in creating best poem, but in extending the filipino masses. He is not the only organisation of words, but the people. He is not only fishing with metapora, they say, but the people are also fishing for change. During the time of the insurer of the Philippines, in the decades "80, there are some who thought to plant armed men in the ranks of those who were armed. Maybe, it is more dangerous in rules when in every act of the masses, people like Pinpin is planted. Hopefully, thus, many activists, servants of arts and public intelligence, like Axel Pinpin!

The skin of the source of the destruction of typhoon Yolanda in the Visayas Region. This is about the ejection of the Social Weather Station that "Very Good" gave the grades of the victims of Yolanda to President Benigno Aquino III in action for them. For the government of PNoy in the palace, after the SWS survey came out, they seem to have another joy. The problem, the thousands of citizens and victims of the storm appeared in the streets saying that PNoy's grades in them were "landed". 12,000 NAG-rally estimated 12,000 victims of Yolanda were rally this past week to condemn the excessive force of the government in helping them. Many have not reached those who said that they attended and joined. There are still a lot of passengers riding a jeepney that came from Samar to stop the road by the police who attended. According to the People's Surge who led the indignation rally, the victims who want to join the coming rallies are increasing. Those who want to go with the rally in Visayas, the victim and not by typhoon Yolanda. There are also many calls for other citizens and organizations outside of the circumstances that they have helped in order to remove the fifty of the government so that he quickly moved and have responded to it. According to the SWS survey, it is said that the grades of PNoy himself from the victims of Yolanda is higher than the victims outside of the dark places. Very Good for PNoy, he said, in Leyte, Samar and nearby areas in the grounds of 79 percent, with the + 54% trust on him while outside the areas mentioned, 69 percent of the grades have been "lies" the survey said. If the survey results are lies, which is thick faced from the data of SWS? Three months old, it has been three months since Yolanda devastated last November 8, 2013 but the victims were considered to be favored by the government in helping. If there is, up to some noodles, sardines and rice only. There are foreigners and private assistance as long as it is just hidden by the corrupt, like imported food and characters, personally until they see them that they will sell in the grocery and mall. There are also Housing projects like bunkhouse. But, the son of tokwa, this is still raining by the anomalies of government officials. It is good that there are private people and organizations that give bigger help to the victims. Do not want to identify the rehabilitation czar Ping Lacson to identify those who are involved in the bunkhouse scam but the result of the investigation of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group is near. In case there is evidence that the bunkhouse is spreading, are you dependable, idol Ping, to reveal the public the inhumane who have money for death, suffering and hunger of the people? Businessman AT: The People's Surge, not the victims of calamities is being given the government of importance to the rehabilitation program but the businessmen. The government of the projects will be approved for a 300 billion fund funds for allegedly the opportunity. But he is not saying that at least it is good to direct help to the calamities but "an estimated 30,000 pesos to those who have totally destroyed homes and 10,000 pesos to those who have partially damaged houses. But in the explanation of DPWH, construction materials will be given and a little salary to those who will make it but for just a few days. P40,000 is needed according to the victims, it is better for the government to give every family affected by the typhoon for more than P40,000 only and they will be able to become rich here. For them, they will think about how the cost will be used for their immediate need, including investment for their occupation. This situation is far from what DPWH is saying and also far from the rehabilitation program. In the position of DPWH, those who are making galvanized iron sheets, cement, hollow block, nail, wire and whatever more than the people with local materials that they can use. If they will depend on the rehabilitation program, they are also like a horse that will get hungry for the time before they can be given assistance. In the long-term program that will last for one, two, three, four and five years. Just Next time to show the relatives of the Palace of Very Good grades to those from Malacanang, they should just buy them first.

We're going to get a lot MORE. By Rolando B. Tolentino, February 11, 2012 We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Reporting by amok (Lawrence Fajardo, director, 2011) in the amok, the Eclipse, the Eclipse, and gambling, selling barbeque, thrift shop and gun, passengers waiting for the terminal, old, gay men, and other creatures - people who are not known aside from the entry of arbitrary moments in the corner of EDSA and Pasay Taft - are being placed as an ordinary life in this country. Simultaneously, the time of the movie is not an ordinary moment. This is a violation of the long-term life of the people, cities and countries under the culture of immigrant. There is no care of the violence because of the democratic history of those in power, and the flow of it on daily lives. The problem in the movie is presented by the daily confusion of violence and culture of the responsibility without linking the history and civic works. Microckic is going to be transferred, even on the main road of the city, it is cruising, which created the responsibility of political power. There is a traffic enforcer but he did not fully fulfill his duty. The police is a gangster who is assigned by arson in the community of poor people who live in the city. Ambulance and investigators arrive in the scene of the crime to make a post-mortem report. There is no implication in the life of the state. In the time of Lino Brocker, this is simple: The poster and portrait of the official in the office of the mayor and ordinary citizens, images of the altar, picture of Rambo beside Marcos, for example. In the amok, there is a staging of action, like the scene where the bloody with a gun is taking the EDSA while the familiar expire that "prohibited to cross, deadly" is also in the scene. The result, like the entirety of the movie, is restricting or mixed with the person who will hold the real. The political commentary is not sharp because of the responsibility of the MMDA, Metro handsome, Noynoy Aquino, Palparan, Willie Revillame, and other FBI of actual power. And the worst problem of the film: The representation of the anticipated kind. In the culture of sexuality, activists and journalists have been identified as the political victim. But the anticipated citizen is also part of the privatization of the state that is insane, instead of being able to improve the harness of the civic justice, he goes wild, and more excuses for who are both anticipated to be victimized. This is the burgeous realism in indie Cinema, to give a representation of the anticipated species to have been locked up in a translator: The capacity of the anticipated species to be devoured by his kind just to explode. The massacre is the massacre as well as a similar kind of father in the terminal will be a witness to the liver of a young child, as well as the driver who is a sibling in the van to his younger sibling. The film was boosted because of the fragmentation of staff, scenes and stories, and the cultural relationship between them at the moment of the attack. It is very different but at the expense of the anticipated kind, it seems that we are just watching a familiar quarrel of the neighbor who is threatening, snatching and lifting, chaos of jumping jubs in the U.P. Fair, and other speeds that are worried about the body of the anticipated species. There was a fabulous happening in the amok, because the street is the one who takes the rest of the life and death. No referendum, which is a trait of indie Cinema at present. But there will be a change of change, like Brillante Mendoza. There is a change due to the director, celebrity, audience, connivance and discussing the film, it is also included in the mold of the state: People who cannot be known aside from a similar source and civic works. There is a difference between the urge to make the same position in society, and it is dangerous for the "lack of race" (in the case of the movie, this kind of), which is a jackpot as a resolution of the sovereignty and civic problems.

Posted by: Almar Dangers on March 1, 2016 in opinion We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. It is not surprising why the support of investors and the payers to Kosehal Ali Aienza in Manila is full of support for the 2016 elections. What is Ali the only first to stand and come from the plan of the current administration or the city government of Manila to raise 300 percent of the tax in Manila. That's why Ali is opposing the City Council of some Countries such as Councilor Rod Lacsamana, and Josie Siscar. Not only in the Council that Ali showed the resistance of the planned harassment of the city government to investors and citizens of the city but, he still faced Manila Mayor Joseph "Erap" Estrada. He asked the father of the city to feel pity for the "children" (investors and citizens) - not to continue the plan to suffer the people - the plan to imposition of too much higher taxes on businessmen in Manila. Ali's suggestion to Erap, instead of raising the tax, chase the unpaying and cheater in paying taxes and remove the tax exemptions. Because of the fight of Ali, the planned 300% tax increase did not work. Instead, the city government has done 150%. But, the government is planning that the anticipated 150% will be imposed after the election. Oh, tay. That's why you are here in Manila, well, be careful in voting who will sit on you. Do not give happiness to you. Whatever it is, even if half of 300% imposed - it can be said that the resistance made by Ali is still a success. It is also a big deal that is why the treasury of 150% increase. Oh, if in case Ali and some colleagues have come from the city council, there is a huge 300% iho and daughter. It's a good thing that Ali is like Ali for the people of Manila. For now, according to the businessmen, they are still having difficulty because there are situations where they feel that the imposition of tax in Manila is not humane and fair. Many complained because of the excessive height of the tax, particularly your small livelihood. Like a small barbershop, he was charged with 20,000 (tax), and even the small various stores have not forgave him. The businessmen in Manila said, the officials of Manila are not fair and fair because they are small and honest to pay tax, load a thin increase but the giant company of communication has been taken to tax. He moved to tax, maybe BIR should investigate this - Paging Commissioner Kim Henares. A giant Communication company, is being used to tax? Is that possible? The payers are thankful because even if they are alone, Ali Atienza was there and managed to standing up the City Council to stop the unjust tax increase. They are also hoping that if Ali won as Vice Mayor of Manila to correct the wrong policies and ways to collect taxes. The payers believe that only Ali is the one who will prevent the solution to get down the pay of those from Manila now. "What they should be chased, kinds of tax evasion and not" those who are paying proper taxes and follow properly in the government. " A businessman said, he does not want to be identified.

The serious crisis in the economy is brought by a crisis in politics. The streaming streak is spreading now. The full force of the growing force of BS Aquino will not be released.

MATERIAL_BASE-1B_81780502 We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. How can the 'Indirect Fire Support' in war? (Part 2) We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. On the part of my story, I have stated the called Indirect Fire System like artillery and a mortar. I hope that it became clear to you after I was able to taste it. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. I understand that most of the civilians do not know how to use the indirect fire support from Artillery or the Mortars. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. To make it clear, it is better to watch the video of Balikatan exercises that shows the knowledge and achievements of our soldiers who are called 'artiliron'. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. If you analyze, the work of the people who firing 105m artillery is very difficult. All the action of the personnel needs to be coordinated. Rema the magic word ha: Coordinated! We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. What is the appearance in the place that is allowed by the artillery rounds? Watch the video on the top of where the Mark will be seen using the target using the White Phosphorus (WP) before he adjust and went after a high-explosive rounds. I experienced this in the position as a firecrackers in the position of the pipe and we can catch the indirect fire support as Forward Observer. The failure to think here is prohibited here or else can still remember! We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The question is, it feels good if you are the ones surrounding the impact area? Obamacare is the answer? Of course, hineee! I experienced that in Shariff Aguak, Maguindanao, when we cannot stop the 105m high explosive (HE) rounds of MILF to attack on the detachment that I was in the mid-0s. I am a sign of the dialogue that I can hear from the soldiers every time the bullets and more than 150 meters from our position. This is the sample: We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Mexicans say: "Aten ku!" We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Illinois said: "Hijo de puta!" We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Areas of Visayas said: "Gikolira who is juxible!" We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Our appearance is funny because of fear of being called fire support. It is painful to that? We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. By the way, to those saying that the White Phosphorus rounds even if there is no Forward Observer, you will recover pre! We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We can even be heard in Thailand, the Dota expert said that the patrol of artillery is just fine even if nobody is talking to Forward Observer. Susme! We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. By the way, this is what we should remember: The White Phosphorus (WP) round is the speed of fire of clothes and other highly bustible materials that are around. He also has a component on the skin of a person because instead of being swept by a person's skin because they are flying, those who are able to catch up with the heat that he will enjoy with you! Do you want to try? We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. By the way, look at the appearance of the White Phosphorus rounds in the video below. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. If you will let the White Phosphorus will make it like the victims? What now are Tsong, you are willing to guess the system in trying to make the artillery? Is it still a chance? We should learn from the experience of others! The finger pointing out? We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Call for fire We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. How are the simple procedures to deliver artillery fire in a heavily engaged unit? We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Listen to you. Do not fall asleep! We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. First, the Fire Direction Center (FDC) needs the grid coordinates of the requesting element, which is the Forward Observer. Who will give a grid? Listen carefully. Then, it is Forward Observer exactly! We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Like that? Yes. That is really like that. Don't you send a text message? Call using the tactical radio. He also read out by the FDC to report that the information given by the grid location, azeland distance of the opponent who wants to be battled by the artillery rounds. The FDC was assured of course that the patrol or the patrol might be broken and this is why they transferred the position while they were fighting. Oisst When patrolling, there is a tactical radio that can be called! We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Why is the person talking to the FDC? Of course, the Independent and the FDC should directly talk because the artillery fire is not guilty! Rema the magic word: Direct talking! Because, if you want to step down and wrong, the two are the first to have faults! We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. What if no one is talking to Forward Observer or Patrol Leader who knows how to call for Fire procedures? Then, not sorry, you can't give artillery support! We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Bakeet isn't allowed to give artillery support without payment? What are you repeating what? Of course, the FDC has no 'eyes'. Is there a blind answer to the target? Perhaps, it is probably a pro-bullye even if there is an Eclipse! We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. I will repeat it. It is painful to hit the 105m ectile, even white phosphus (WP) or high-explosive (HE) man! So that you will feel the scenario, you will play the video on top and imagine that it is your skin. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. For those who still don't want to believe, the philosaurs and artworks are open, they are open to the try-out of the people who want to make the effect of it. Any volunteer? We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The puzzle We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We have a lot of things that we are thinking about about the ongoing fire support. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. As said as saying: "With great power, is a great responsibility." We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The training of people using artillery and mortar assets are intense for going to war. They are always raped by these knowledge through sustainment training to avoid accidents and make sure the army is affected in what they are doing. The responsibility of the people using this is not to hurt other soldiers and even innocent civilians. Magic word ha: Responsibility. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. In a military operation, the units commanders are planning to plan well for using the indirect fires and they are preparing the Fire Support Plan as part of the Operations Order (OPORD). If you did not plan it, they planned to failed! Why? Then, the 105m artillery is not like your M1911A1 caliber 45 pistol that can be holed on the side and bunk, it can be pointed out and fired a gun speed like a dum! He said! We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. So, to the experts when they are starting to shoot at the artillery, the engaged unit without talking to Forward Observer, think more! We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

And, I give IT my interpretation, according to the vision of Director Ishma. There, take one of my scenes with him. " And another, Haplos. As Auring, Locsin was both child-like and coply, innocent, provocative, powerful yet to Help the rescue. Cherie, Diva of the local showbiz In all Her villain roles opposite the Megastar Sharon Cuneta, Cherie Gil showed all of US how to become the villain. I have to give Her credit for being the reason why there is Lavinia Arguelles Honor Rolls we every holiday season. Cherie is the one who has a gravitas to say the long line that you know She meant IT was the fun wing of such a riol. Then, the movie Sonata suddenly greeted the cinemas, as if Gil and director Peque Gallaga and Lore Reyes of the Maria Callas of This world. As Regina Cadena, an aging opera star WHO lost Her voice that resulted to the collapse of Her career, the death of Her relationship with Her version of Aristotle Ontarmac and the heartwarming friendship She shared with a precocious provincial boy, Cherie became the fulfilment of a Diva on the verge of a nervous breakdown and how sweet, innocent, pure love for Her and the Nick ot time.

We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. This is my third SONA, and just like when we started to dream. Just like when we decided to take the straight path. It's just like when we started to get away from the two, not only on the road but in the system. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Two years have passed since you said, "we are tired of corruption; we are tired of poverty." It is time to restore a government that is truly an ally of the people. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Like many of you, I became aware of the harassment of the powerful. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. I was already a twelve years old when martial law was declared. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Our world was reversed: Seven years and seven months old, my father was jailed; three years forced to go abroad; I became a witness to the suffering of many because of dictatorship. Here is my principle: If someone is disturbed and robbed of the rights, he is the one I put on. If there is abusive understanding, he will fight him. If I saw something wrong in the system, I am tasked to correct this. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Martial law has long been finished. We asked before, "if we are not, who else?" And "if not now, when?" Our response is, we are and now. The democratic is stolen using discrimination and violence, we recovered in a peaceful way; we are successful to express the light from the dark chapter of our history. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. But we should not forget the root of martial law: The dictator is using the constitution to remain in power. And until now, the collision between the likes of the system is still ongoing, against those who want to continue worsening. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. From the first day of our tenure, no one met us but the nightmares of the lost decade. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. There is the case of North Rail. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. After all, he loves it, after the negotiation will be repeated, even more. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. In spite of this, the benefits came. The thirds of the train sets three, and at the station, from five, became two. What's worse, his debt is being paid for us, now. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. There is no dent bonus in some GOC, despite the financial loss of their agencies. There is a billion peso peso that PAGCOR gave for coffee. There is the system management in the PNP that set aside the need for the weapon of 45 percent of the police, just to earn from the old helicopter that was bought in Delbrand New. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. No one was left to spend, multiple times and the debts needed to be paid. A long list that we are complete is full: The 66,800 backlog in classrooms, which costs approximately 53.44 billion pesos; the 2,57212 backlog on chairs, which costs 2.31 billion pesos. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. When we arrived, thirty-six million Filipinos are still not members of PhilHealth. What is needed for them to join: May reach 42 billion pesos. Let us add to all that is the 103 billion pesos that is needed for the modernization of Haas Sanders. In front of all of these, the left in our fund is available: 6.5 percent of the total budget for the remaining six months of 2010. For us to join the fight when the hands and feet are tied, their eyes are tied, and the referee and the judge are still allies. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. That is why in the first three months of our tenure, we are waiting for the arrival of Sunday to share the nightmares that we face us. We expected that we will need a "less than two years before having a meaningful change. Will we be given enough understanding of the people? We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. But if there is one thing that has been stamped on our race, and several times that we have proved in the whole world: No one can't do it. We dreamed of change; we achieved the change; and now, this is common. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The road you will open is straight, patch, and no lumps; the only tongs are asphalted or cement. This is normal. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The situation if the storm is approaching: The relief, and not the people are waiting for relief. Rescue Services are already waiting for the people, and we are not the only one who came to help each other. This is normal. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The two in the streets are just coming from the police, ambulance, or firefighters - not to the government official. This is also normal. The government of former abuse, now, is the real ally of the Filipino. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We implemented reform: Removed the unnecessary, chased by corrupt, and showed this world open for business under New management, the Philippines. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Even the former sick of Asia, now, is already full of enthusiasm. When we had a positive credit rating, others said, luck. Now that they are eight, still a chance? In the Philippine Stock Exchange index, when we first looked for the 4,000 index, there were doubts. Now, with the number of all-time high, even economic managers, it is difficult for the counting, and I am also surprised: Forty-four of us, and the index is rarely down to 5,000. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. It is the first quarter of 2012, the GDP growth, 6.4 percent; miles) If before, we are always trying to borrow money, now, we are not the one who lend money. Before, we are begging for investments; now, they are going to visit. Japanese companies, in a meeting, said: "You might want to look at IT. We are not the most cheap, but we are first in technology. " Even the leader of another big bank in Inglatera, recently talked to us, said, they should be implemented in consulting the peace talks. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. In every corner of the world, the referendum shows admiration. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, I quote: "Keep an eye on the Philippines." The Foreign Policy magazine, including one of ASEAN's leader, said we may be, and I quote, "Asia's Next Tigers." Ruchir Sharma, leader of Emerging Market Equities and Global Macro of Morgan Stanley, I quote: "The Philippines is no longer a joke." And it looks like he is not a boball, because it is estimated that his company has put his company in our country. Hopefully, the face of admiration from other countries will be followed by the local founder. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We make sure that progress is up to more. Let us remember: When we started, there were 760,357 along the beneficiary of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program. We targeted the target] to reach 3.1 million in two years. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. It was only February of this year, the third of the beneficiaries of the Pantawid Family. In the next year, we will be raised in the jurisdiction of 3.8 million houses; five times the size of what we found. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. It will be a long term for this project. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The study is not complete, but as early as now, the number has been great. Based on the list of DSWD: There are 1,672,977 mothers who are regularly undergoing check-up. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Also add, 1,672,814 children are reduced against diarrhea, polio, measles, and others. Four point fifty-seven million student students are not forced to be absent because of poverty. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. In our health: When we arrived, there were only two percent of Filipinos who were enrolled in PhilHealth. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. What's worse, it is not yet determined if all of them are among those who are really in need of care of the state, or just a fortune close to the politician. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Now, 85 percent of all citizens, are members of this. This means, 23.31 million Filipinos are not yet added to the scope of PhilHealth since we give a mandate. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. What's good here is: The 5.2 million hardest part of the National Household Targeting System, full-fully and no payment will benefit from the benefits of PhilHealth. Because of the No Balance poster policy of the Department of Health, the cure for dengue, pneumonia, asthma, cataract, as well as treatment of the Eclipse disease such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and Acute leukemia, you will get free of the poorest countrymen. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. This is the process of treatment for them: You are entering a translation hospital. You will reflect your PhilHealth card. You will be treated. And you will go home comfortable without being released by a kusing. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. According to one of the briefing we attended, four of ten Filipinos, did not even see health professionals in their lifetime. In others, it is bigger: There are six in every ten Filipinos who can get away from care of health professionals. Whatever we use it, it cannot be denied: Disturbing the number of Filipinos who are not reached by the health of the government. We will responded to this. From ten thousand when we arrived, the nurses and midwives have already reached 30401. IT makes them MORE than eleven thousand Community Health teams that serves as a bridge to be MORE likely to Work with doctors and nurses in the community. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. And if the nurses will only go to where their chief is, now, because of the right targeting, where they are sent: In places that have been left in the bottom of the society. Our health professionals were sent to 1,021 pook which is part of the Pantawid Family, and the 609 poorest city and municipal hall, according to the study of the National Anti-Poverty Commission. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Two problems are being addressed: Aside from the work and being given Work experience, thousands of nurses and midwives who have previously been able to get along with their knowledge, the quality of concern for millions of our countrymen is also affordable. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. However, we do not allow it to be satisfied with it, because we aspire: Health for all. This starts, not in the hospitals, but within their own homes. Extra knowledge, vaccine, and check is needed so that we will stay away from illness. In addition to that, we have an effort to avoid diseases that can be avoided. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. For example: I mentioned the Mosquito traps against dengue last year. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. You know, the people who are strict in research. It is still early to say that we are surely sure, but the initial results of this program will be encouraged. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We challenged the effect of Mosquito traps in places where the highest incident of dengue is recorded. In the entire province of Bukidnon last 2010, there were 1,216 cases. When the Mosquito trapped in 2011 was placed in 2011: It seems that it was helped by thirty-seven; 97 percent of this Reduction. In the town of Ballesteros and Claveria in Cagayan, there are 228 cases of dengue in 2010. In 2011, eight were recorded. In Catarman, Northern Samar: 434 cases of dengue in 2010 were only four in 2011. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. This is just a first study. But as early as now, we should be better to thank Secretary Ike) of DOH and Secretary Mario Montejo of DOST, we have no more raise, maybe for the clapping of you to study and coordinate. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We still have a lot of solace. It is disturbing the high maternal mortality of the country. That is why we are making steps to address the needs of women's health. We also want to achieve Universal Health care, and have sufficient equipment, facilities, and staff to the institutions of health. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. In our response to them, the Sin Tax Bill contributed a lot. Hopefully this will pass on as soon as possible. Vices will be lessened, counting the funds for health. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. What will be met with the youth at school? Who are still hiding behind the tree, that is why they will first learn to cook? Did they speak to the floor while they are fighting with textbooks from their classmates? We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Our faith with Secretary Luistro: Before the next year, we have inherited 66,800 shortage of classrooms. I will repeat it, next year, "there are only 40,000 people this year. What we inherited 2,57s 212 backlog on the chair, we will finally be addressed before the 2012 election. In this year, the 61.7 million backlog of the textbook is also forgotten to reach, at last, one is to one ratio of books to students. Hopefully, now that the backlog of education is already gone, we should try not to have a backlog because of the volume of students. I think the answer is responsible. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. And so that we Can't leave Labour State Universities and Colleges, we have a proposed 43.61 percent improvement in their budget for next year. IT's just a reminder: All we're doing, with directions; there's a associated condition, IT's an additional budget. The agreement was to be implemented by SUC Reform Roadmap of Education and the corresponding state Universities and Colleges, to ensure quality will be the product of the hope that the state will open. If your grades are high in the assignment, expect that we will also work hard to answer the remaining needs. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. What is happening in our budget is always Addition to education. Just think: The budget of DepEd that gave us in 2010, 177 billion pesos. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Our proposal for 2013: 292.7 billion pesos. In 2010, the budget for SUCs were 21.03 billion pesos. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. It is said that our proposal to reach 37.13 billion pesos is our proposal for 2013. But despite this, as early as now, there is a plan to cut classes for our speakers in Mendiola. This simple: The 292.7 is bigger than 177, and the 37.13 is bigger than 21.03. That is why if someone will tell the treasury of education or to tell the treasury of the education, we will just convince your schools to offer an al math Class for you. And I hope, with what kind of "to, we wish, this kind of copal that is when you start school. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. When we took office, and to start the meaningful reforms, some have belittled the show-off of the government. But for fortune, it is just a flash of budget for budget. There are still a few who does not want to retire from spreading them; they are shut down on Good news, and the industry has made criticism. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. If you have a problem that before the end of the year, every child has their own chair and book, look at them, eye on the eyes, and say, "We do not want to study." We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. If you have a bad feeling that the 5.2 million poorest people along the Filipino people can go to the hospital without worries about expenses for treatment, look at them again, eyes on the eye, and say, "We do not want to get healed." We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. If you are angry that there are three million families who are going to the fulfilment of their dreams because of the Pantawid Family, look at them, eyes on the eyes, and say, "I will give you back to the lack of hope." We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The time is over when there is only a choice of powerful what is important. For example, the former leaders of TESDA was distributed by scholarship voucher; the problem is, there is no corresponding fund for this. Naturally, the voucher will heed. The cost of more than 2.4 billion pesos is the payment of more than 1,000 pesos from the government. A person is sending handsome as a administration; Everyone is able to pay for now.

When we arrived in 2010, he was playing 3.1 million. Just imagine: In the length of their administration, the reason that the tourist destination is added 1.3 million only; we have contributed half a year there. We are just in June only in 2012 - 2.1 million tourists have been buried. There are more who will pour in the peak season before the end of the year, that's why I will not have questions that we will give the quota of 4.6 million tourists for 2012. This means, 1.5 million tourists will be added to it. That's why, for two years, the growth of our tourist attraction is bigger, compared to the reason that we will be replaced within nine and a half years. We're going to get a lot MORE.

If the Filipino people will continue to be united, as we showed that the Puerto Princesa Underground River as one of the New Seven wonders of Nature, there is no doubt that we will achieve it. Our statement in the world: "It's more fun in the Philippines." Even if Secretary Mon Jimenez is not yet a year in his position, we have made the positive results of our given reforms.

They inherited the debt of debt; what they inherited from us, 177 billion pesos. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Isn't it that before, we believe that 1.3 million metric tons is the scarcity of rice, and to address this, "less than two million metric tons were imported from 2010. They seem to be limited if they are pro-order of rice, but because it is too much, it is just rotting in the storage. The 1.3 million metric tons, we are reduced to 860,000 tons. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. This year, just 500,000, including the buffer in case we reach the storm.

We're going to get a lot MORE. Let us go against what is happening in the energy sector. Throughout: Before, the wireless in the town hall, "energized" the entire Country. That's why they can be proud of that 99.98 percent of barangays in the country have electricity. Even the service that should have been fully utilized by Filipinos, feels incomplete? That is why, in order to try the ability of the DOE and None, we sets 1.3 billion pesos in order to destroy the first target of 1,300 missiles, on this 3million peso each. When they were finished, the fund allocated by the fund allocated: 1,520 reported, and just spend 814 million pesos. They were able to do it in just three months, and there are still a lot of things to do here until the 36,000 reported without electricity.

The decrease of crime volume in the entire country continues. The more hundred thousand crimes recorded in 2009, more than half have been reduced: 246,958 only this 2011. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

We do not say that there is no crime happening, but I think, there is nothing to be angry that she would have been mad. Raymond Dominguez, who has been going in and out of jail, isn't it just over a year, sentenced to life and imprisoned? The two of his siblings have also filed a case and is currently having a prisoner. There were two suspects in the bus bombing in Makati last year, one of them passed away; "one, the strokes of bars.

Instead of taking care of the state, it is as if our soldiers are intentionally placed in uncertainty. We will not allow them to remain like this. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Just after a year and seven months, we were able to lay down more than two billion pesos for the AFP modernization program. The thirty-three billion peso fund was given to the said program in the past fifteen years. "We are just getting caught in the status quo," he said. If the AFP modernization bill passed on Congress, we can provide a pitch of five billion pesos for the next five years. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

This is not about fighting and firm. This is not about the hands of the hands. This is about achieving peace. This is about our ability to defend ourselves - something that we have been thinking is impossible. This is about the life of a soldier everyday who are fighting in danger; this is about his family waiting for him to return to safe, whatever he is facing. Let us allow some of the restrictions to tell the change of their lives: We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. [Video starts] We're going to get a lot MORE.

Before our reforms start at ARMM, and you know, there are Ghost students there, who will walk in a Ghost school, to register as a Ghost teacher. The apparatus made by OIC Governor Mujiv Hataman: Four schools who were found with Ghost students; also being investigated by the teachers that the name was not shown on the list of Professional Regulation Commission, as well as the personnel of the government who were not kneeling in their rented house. Living fifty-five Ghost Entry was removed from the payroll. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

That is just a few of the destination of a total of 8.59 billion pesos that was granted by the national government to fulfill the reforms in ARMM. I will also clarify it, not yet included here is the annual support they receive, which this 2012 reached 11.7 billion pesos. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Even the former who want to condemned, are now seeing the effect of reform. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We recognize as a sign of their trust in the past seven months, when there is no encounter between the military and the MILF. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

Sometimes, the process becomes complicated; we are just signs that we are close to achieving our only desires: Peace. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. A peaceful conversation is the principle that we pushed for to complete our Executive Order about mining. The mind behind the consensus: The natural resources to improve the lives of the Filipinos, not only now but also for the next race. We did not taste the fruit of this industry, if the payment is the destruction of nature. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. But this is just the first step. Just think, in 2010, 145 billion pesos is the total amount that got from mining, but 13.4 billion pesos only or nine percent went to the treasury of the country. The inherent wealth, owned by you; we will not let the cut will go to the Filipinos. We are hoping for the cooperation of Congress to make sure that we can take care of the environment and ensure that the benefit of the public and private sector will be sure that we can get from this industry. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Let us discuss the situation in the Disaster Risk. Before, the government who is helping, asking for help. Now, the storm is still in the Ocean, they know where you will give assistance, and there is a clear plan to avoid danger. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Every time the disaster is talking about, I always remember what happened to us in Tarlac when it was hit. With the strong rain, a dike broke down. When the barangay captain woke up, his family was already taken by the flood and in 140 characters. It's good that the whole family survived. The carabao is just unlucky that they were left tied to the tree; this is due to the strength of being run over. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Many are also helpless in the hit of typhoon Ondoy, Peaks, and Sendong. There are a lot of people who died in the onslaught of the calamities that he has experienced.

In exchange for conditional cash transfer, take care of the trees; there are also those who will make a new blogy. Three hundred thirty-five thousand pesos is the Filipinos who have recovered livelihood from this. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. In another program, the private sector was asked to contribute to the coffee and cap in the community, and teaches them to take care of and make sure that the harvest is high. Coffee is being planted under the trees, which while standing, we can make sure that the flood and help us to avoid damage. The company that gave a binhi, is also a buyer of harvest. The communities who have additional income, win the private sector, will win the next race that will benefit from the higher tree. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Illegal logging has long been a problem. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Since the copy 23, meanwhile, Mayor Jun who were more than six million pesos worth of gs.

Before, it is impossible; it is impossible if the government is blind to illegal activities. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. That's why you have no conscience; you are repeating the lives of fellow Filipinos: Prepare you. Our happy days are over. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Thirty-four employees of DENR, a PNP provincial director, and seven Chiefs of Police. We are already asking for a regional Director of PNP that he is deaf with my command and is blind to the giant tractors passing through their scenery. If you will not fix yourself, we'll target you. You will rush under your peers, we can catch you. We will also include your buddies. That's why even before we will meet our path, I will talk to you again, maybe you will be better for you. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. From the womb, in studying and working, there is a change in facing the Filipinos. And in case he chose giving service to the government, the care of the state will continue until his retirement. There is a time when the government will look at his contribution as a servant of the country, and he will not treat him in his position as well as the investment. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. I think, and I'm surprised here: We have pensioners receiving 500 pesos only every month. How can he take it in the water, electricity, and food everyday? Our reply: After the New Year, the monthly pension pension of our old-age and Disability pensioners will not decrease. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

We can also chase that; but for now, we have a Good news for those working in the government: Performance-based Incentives. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Before, the agency is strolling by an agency, and the most low rating of the employee is still satisfactory. Because of social interaction, the supervisor is having a hard time to give a justifiable rating of his personnel. It is pitiful to work hard. They are losing a reason for achievements because the incentives for those who are lazy and persistent. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Here is one of our steps to address this. Starting this year, we are going to implement a system where the bonus is based on fulfilling the agencies in their target for the year. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The key is in the hands of the employee in his improvement. Incentives, thirty-five thousand pesos, depends on the show-off of your work.

We do this, not only to raise the confidence and show our trust in our public servant. Most of all, this is for the Filipino who are hoping for the honest and good service from the public servant, and they are hoping that they are the only boss of their government. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. You know, from the beginning, there is only one question to question what we are saying, "if there is no corrupt, there is no poor." Until now there are still few asking: Are the good governance be eaten? The simple answer, "of course." We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Let us think of our origin: Before, it seems like "wild West" is the capital of the Philippines. There is a danger of business, my risings are even faster because they are not sure and able to deny the policy. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Even if you are shaking hands with the right, you will be anxious to use the left. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Now, because the fight is fair, and there is an open and not changing policies, the rise of confidence in our economy continues. The entry of investment continues; the increase of work is ongoing; the positive cycle of consumption, growth of business, and increase of citizens who are employing. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Because the government's spending is good, there is no tags in the system. Because the tax to collect tax is good, the treasury of the country is growing. Every peso is being collected, it is certain to go straight to the road, peso for the vaccine, peso for classroom and chairs, peso for our future. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Because the work of the bridge, roads, and buildings are built up where needed. The way is well, the product is faster, service, and citizens. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Because the management of agriculture is good, the production of food is increasing, and not to the price of it. The pay is stable, and the national economy is stronger. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. It is true, the strong and strong economist is the most effective shield against the challenges faced by the world. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. It has been two years that the obstacles in progressing, and now, we themselves can stop our own improvement. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We have done all of this while each country is also covered by each country in different corners of the world. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We are not alone in the world, that is why while we will respond to our own problems, it is only appropriate to monitor some of the events that can affect us. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The events happened in Bajo de Massimo. There are fishermen who enter our territory. Our ship was confiscated and confiscated from their ships were the endangered species. As a leader, I need to implement the law that exists in our country. With the advancement of this, the Nine-Dash Line Theory of the Chinese, which claimed almost the entire West Philippine Sea, and our rights and many other countries, including China, which was ratified by the United Nations Convention on the laws of the Sea. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Significant calm is what we showed. The ship of Haas Downs, as a sign of our clean goal, we immediately replaced the warship. We did not argue with the attacks of their media to us. Maybe our rights should not be fired on the other side to respect our rights, like respect to their rights as both countries in the one world that needs to be shared. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We have people who say that the Bajo de Masinloc will just let us just avoid. But if someone entered your yard and told him that what he is standing is to him, will you agree? It seems that we are not the right to give away from others who really want us. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. That is why I wish for the people to cooperate with this issue. There is only one thing that we do. Please help me in the other side is the reason of our commitment. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The situation is not simple, and the solution will not be simple. Trust you, we salute the experts, and for all the leaders of our country, including our allies - as well as those on the other side of this issue - to find a solution that is acceptable to all. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. For every step in the straight path, we make changes. But there are still a few trying to tailot. While running me now, there are those who are whispering in a room and right now with what I am saying; looking for a hole to be criticized tomorrow. They will say, "Words, and the straight path is not true." They are the ones who will say, let us unite; forgive us just to move forward. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. I will not accept it. From the forget that ten years lost to us? Forgive the forget just for the farmers buried in debt because of the importation of rice, when it is possible to cultivate our own land? We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Forgive the forget that is for the family of a police who died without a fight, because he only have batons while chasing the armed criminals? We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Forgive the forget just to those orphaned by fifty-seven victims of the Maguindanao massacre? Will they be restored by "forgive and forget?" Forgive the forget all the debts that drowned us in the rotten state? Forgive the forget to restore the old status quo? My response is, "Ang forgive, you forgot, not." If you have sinned, you will not be liable, you will be able to make the people suffer. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. True unity and agreement will come from true and absolute justice. Justice is called the plunder case filed against the former President. Justice to give him a chance to face the accusations and defend himself. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We witnessed justice during the two-nine of May. That day, we proved that justice will possibly prevail even if your opponent has a high duty. On that day, there was a Delin Flores in Panabo, Davao del Norte, who said, "Powerful only law needs to be followed by the court interpreter like me, and the Prime justices." It is possible that the scale is fair; it is possible that even the rich and powerful will be held accountable. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. So for the next president, the citizenship is largely expected from you. We have proven that it is possible; our work now, make sure that change will continue towards true justice, after our term. There are many damage in the system you need to repair, and I know it will not be easy. I know how big is it!! Burden a clear mandate; but this is the one who ordered us by the people; this is the duty we promised; this is what we need to perform. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Our aim is simple: If you are innocent, you will face the court, because you are confident that you will be acquitted. If you are the perpetrator, whatever your last name is, or how many are attached to your name, there is also assurance that you have a responsibility for your sins. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Thank you for Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales, in accepting a challenge to be the true watchmen of the country. After all, he can refuse his responsibility and say, "I am retired, it can be" others? " But his concern for the country was on top. Despite this, there was still a gift to him by a grenade at home. Ma'am, there are still those who will come with challenges; maybe for budget, you will be called, which is called, which is greedy or communists going to the dictator because of the active reforms that we are implementing. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. I am impressed by your show-off and thank you for being an instrument of justice, especially during the height of the impeachment trial. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Thank you for the two institutions that are comprising Congress: In the Senate and legislative de representation, the people will balance and see enough enough. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. To all those who helped in using the process of justice: You pass through severe challenges, criticisms, and doubts; with the worry that if we lose, you are the first target of the opponent. But you are not shaken. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Filipinos rely on you, and you proved that the hope for you is right. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. You did not disappoint the people; you explained especially our future. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Just a reminder: The fight against a corrupt official who was removed from his position was not finished, in an anomalous contract that could be implemented, or in the office that the governing is being considered. That is why we are calling for the Congress to pass the proposal to pass the amendment to the Anti-Money Laundering Act, so that we will further limit the disorders of corrupt. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. This we are experiencing now: Each has been launched and is lighted by each way, bridge, airport, train, and port; each signed without lumps; the safety and peace from the city to the village; the return of the eyes of the youth; all of these, we've reached within two years. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Let us take advantage of these two years, and the past nine and a half years we have been fighting for them. "Isn't it being pushed by the agenda of change? The same with our goals, it is likely, we are with the agendment. And if you are against us, maybe you are against what we are doing. If they are opposing the agenda of change, can he say that they are on your side? We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The election is approaching. You, our boss, is the only thing we will follow. My question to you, "Boss, where will we walk? Is our trip to the straight path, or offer a masterpiece, why are we going to retreat, go back to the path that are twisted and without merit? " We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. I remember when we started. I am aware of the weight of!! We will welcome us. I am among those who are thinking: Do you want to straighten out this kind of crooked system? We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Here is what I learned from two hundred months of our leader: Nothing is impossible. Nothing is impossible because if the people can see that they are the only boss of their government, they will carry it, they themselves will lead to meaningful change. It is not impossible that the Philippines will become the first country in the Southeast Asian region that will give and give free vaccination against the virus. It is not impossible for the Philippines to standing up and say, "the Philippines is in the Philippines - and we are ready to defend this." It is not impossible that the Filipino who is waiting for a long time when there is a foreigner - the Filipino, now, he is still being honored by the whole world. It is really good to be a Filipino in these times. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Last year, I asked the people, thank those who contributed to positive change in society. The challenges that we passed by is not a joke, that is why it is only appropriate to thank the people who were able to handle, to repair the wrong caused by bad governance. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. To all members of my Cabinet: Thank you very much. "The people are lucky and there are people like you who are ready to surrender the private and peaceful lifestyle to deliver public service, even if you know the replacement is a smaller salary, danger, and criticisms. So thank you very much again. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Hopefully, they will not name it at home because I personally name: To Father Catalan Arevalo, and Sister Agnes Guillen, who spit and makes my life stronger, especially during the time the challenges in us are already peak, thank you very much.

If there is no discipline in a home, the foundation of the morality of children is growing, so they are losing respect for each other and the parents themselves. The lack of this is the reason for the failure of the parents to implement policies that we have to guide children that are growing. If parents failed in this matter, their children are losing respect for the time, money and trying to reject the recognition of the things that they need to grow normal. To the musings of no discipline, allow children to do what they want... so because they want them, for example, the Hotdog, hamburger and chicherya, their parents are really giving up because they love their children that they want. If the children are sick or cannot be sickly, the other parents grew sickly, because of their doubt, and when the blame is trying to hide is dirty water and wind! We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. No matter how much progress is a country if most of its citizens have no discipline, progress is losing significance.

Planted in their minds that the implementation of discipline is their freedom so they are driving the rally to show their objections to laws related to it. The judiciary is also not helping with the explanation of the law because of the non-care issue of the temporary restraining Order (TRO) because it is appropriate for the constitution and democracy.... but serving a hole that can be examined by the corrupt, which is why they are abused.

PW: What can you say about the call of Duterte to all-out war in the communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) / NPA? Jaime "Ka Diego" Padilla: The Oscars of the past regime failed, from Oplan Lambat BITAG 1 to the current Oplan peace. Not all-out war like the total war of Cory Aquino will solve the armed conflict of the country. Duterte is just taking advantage of the earlier Presidents that will fail in their attempt to suppress the Spanish movement. The armed army is always ready to face any lash of the state to fight for the rights of the citizens and fully fulfill a real, fair and lasting peace. PW: Who will hit all-out war of President Duterte and operation of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP)? JDP: Citizens are victims of all-out war of Duterte. We are sure that human rights violations are increasing. In fact, before the all-out war, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) launched operations in communities that cause violence.

This is part of the duty of the NPA as the armed army of the Spanish movement. This is to ensure that the member of the NDFP panel will not be caught again so that they can still be caught by their own duties while there is no peace talks. PW: Do you still want to pursue peace talks? JDP: We still want to push the peace talks while there is a fight. This is where we can ensure that our hands were not tied while the AFP launched the AFP to the Spanish base. The peace talks can still continue to continue to discuss the problems of the armed conflict and answer the root of poverty in the country. PW: What do you call for Duterte? JDP: We call for Duterte to continue the peace talks to answer the five decades of fighting in the country. As well, to see his sin-responsibility in the discussion, he needs to free the political prisoners as a duty in Carhrihl and make sure that Jasig will continue to protect the Malaysian Consulate. PW: What do you call for the people? JDP: The red mandering firm continues to push peace talks and join in the national issues. Let us show the regime that poverty is still severe in the country.

While there is a collision of many about politics, Bro, we should give attention to the diseases that go to us this rainy season. Especially dengue and leptospirosis. Although they can be treated, many are still dying and of course, many have been used to hunger and suffering. Especially when the majority of those who are struck are poor. Another record we look at some records, Bro, about the disease. This August, there was a hit of dengue, 2,166 in Zamboanga and with 15 were taken by Lord for them. Those who are struck and dying in other provinces are still different. We are following leptospirosis and there are reports that died in Bacolod City. But in October 2013, what happened was bad that started in the month of January. There are more than 131,000 cases of dengue and the 470. In leptospirosis, there is a case of 1,964 and has taken the Lord to 307. That is how dengue and leptospirosis are. So we should not be complacent, especially this rainy season that our illness gets worse. Almost both of you studied, Bro, those assigned to hospitals that are sick of dengue and leptospirosis. The death of the patients reached three weeks. If the patients can live, the cost of expenses for three weeks is severe. The expenses here is moderate to 30 million pesos. But for the poor, it is only for the poor while the rich has spent hundreds of pesos to millions. What if the two were hit, three or the whole family? Except for the expenses, fare, money and payment for those watching. If you are a worker, there are two or three months of salary. That is why you are sure that you are going to run for the usurism and Indians to ask for help. And that is on your debt. 20,000-P40,000 in the funeral parlor, you are already dead, you will not be forgiven by the funeral parlor. In the provinces, you can't use a funeral home and can no longer be blessed by the priest who also accept the drop of Holy water to your corpse if you want to be frugal. Just call Manang and you will send a rosary within nine days and you can give you a coffee and rice cakes only to give them until 40 days. But there is really additional expenses "when you got unlucky in the hospital. You will pay to the hospital of 20,000 pesos Plus extra expenses for taking care of the patient, this is also the payment of the funeral of you. The expenses in the wake will still be increased. So, in total, Bro, you will finish P40,000 to 80,000 pesos. If you are a job to minimum wages, for a few years, you pay for your sick or death? We are already approaching the news and coming to us who are asking for help. Many cases cannot be released in the hospital because there is no payment without payment, even in the morge if he was unlucky. If your corpse can be released, many will be shackled because the victims will not gather at the right time for this. That's why it brought her too much work. Someone is running for captain, mayor, Gob, DSWD, PCSO and others. In Manila, a relative is carrying a death certificate to ask alms from jeepneys drivers. Why would it be a burial if there is no death certificate from hospitals, municipal and others because of the lack of payment. Luck is the ones being helped by those who are just dead. So, if there is an end of the police, you are dead. As soon as the burial will end up. Oh "isn't it, he cries? What are the things to do? To prevent or lessen our illnesses or excessive suffering from these diseases, it is good to be ep-esep well. First, do not go to barangay health centers so that we will know the symptoms of these diseases. If we have symptoms, we need to go to these centers and consult. Do not rush your guts, especially if children, elderly, pregnant and sick are the symptoms of them. If you will only take action if it is an emergency, you are dead. Second, the knowledge will help a lot on how to get these diseases. According to him, from mosquitoes is the dengue while from the urine of rats and other animals. But how to eradicate or avoid mosquitoes that are in our surroundings and how to fight the leap that is really spreading and spreading especially in the flood? You will also sleep. Third, don't forget IT. Our fellowmen, neighbors and others are our household help in defending these diseases. Others will run around us in the hospital, we will surface at the time of need and ready to help even if there is no replacement. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

MATERIAL_BASE-1B_83771555 The moon and gun is still good. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Reporting by the moon and gun at EB Maj about the partnership between Chris Millado and Ando Ranay. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The "month and gun" of Chris Millado often mention as one of the classic Dula who are against the Philippine US-Marcos and one of classic patriots. When it was shown this year, there were friends who told me to watch, because she was beautiful and even cried. That is why I watched, and I did not fail. The "month and gun" consists of five stories of people who fought against the dictatorship, particularly during the fight when Senator Ninoy Aquino was killed on August 21, 1983. In his message to the souvenir program of Dula, Millado said that he wrote in 1984, time even the UP School of Economics, saying that the country's severe crisis. In different parts of the Dula, the faith of the time: Laktown, August Twis-One Movement, yellow confetti in Makati, missiles with the call to boost the election and picture of Ninoy, and others. But it is good for Dula, the stories are meaningful in particular time that they represented. The first, about this round of siblings, activists and workers in Laktown when the latter arrived in Metro Manila. The second is the story of the woman Imagis, a national minority, with the help of a woman who also chilling him about the military's murder in the basis of the accusation of the New People's Army or NPA. The third, the negotiations of a socialite to his housemate about his interfering with the anti-Marcos family. The fourth is to be fetched by a female activists in the body of his NPA, the mourning for his death, and this is a reminder of this. And fourth, the arrest, interrogation and misconduct of the police to a student activists. The immediate notice of the Dula is the script. The character has a secret and life, the stories of their lives, and the story of the lives they presented. Millado said, "Lahore of the character... is based on the actual person I met, worked with each other, met with a moment, read and heard from the secret meetings, our speakers, and barricades." It can be seen that Millado observing and sunk in their joy, grief, love, drama, kaku and other emotions. This is probably the aspect of the "moon" in the title. But what is also good in Dula is how the part of this personal and political crisis - that is not just the anti-dictatorship, but in the struggle for the implementation of the society. This is probably the aspect of "gun" in the title. Dula entered the personal not to move away and be imprisoned here, but to whom he will have shown on personal stability in the collective struggle, and politicians who will struggle. That's why you will bring the Dula to the different emotion - in a way that is careful and there is a part of it - to bring back to the activists and revolution. Here, it is strictly implemented, they do not make a shield, the month of personal life and the gun of the political struggle. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Made the ability to be moved to the story about the woman who got the dead body of his NPA. He passed through a severe question in principle and struggle, but it ended up to a strong wave here; in the feeling of being together with many; in the assumption of being a companion of many; in the assumption of the lack of meaning of his life and death but he went on the understanding of its significant significance. Many of those who are at the same age of viewers who take advantage of awareness is the margin of tears and hear the control that he inhaled. This is probably the most painful but the most sweet Flying kiss that I saw in my whole life. The great script, a third of the great performances of the actor in the experiment of Ando Ranay. Angeli Bayani is very good at the young woman who is being called. His speech, as if IT is, but IT's a different language. The founder of the priest, JC Santos, is not able to answer what he is saying, but you will understand clearly, with the help of some sustainable words and marubb emotion. Many asked after: Is it really the language of Bayani? Because it came from the heart, and branded the heart. Mayen Estana is also very credible to play the young NPA. He was able to show the love, sadness, anger, sadness, loneliness, mourning and the different emotions in that scene. Married couple, mother and mother, activists responded. Jackie Lou Blanco will also lauds the young socialite - made a business wearing a bath. He emphasizes the long theologists and he emphasizes the audience when he shows his character, which is probably!, or a one of "They of Manila" now: His thoughts on the struggle, and others. The model of his performance was Maita Gomez, activists and former NPA, who went out of the picture before the story started. Maita became aware of the First quarter Storm in 1970 while the character of Blanco was in the early 2000s, but any amazed Maita will be worried about the performance of Blanco. Many interesting and able to think of Dula. This is brave to show the dangers and sacrifice of the activists and leaving the common, but it is also clear in showing contention, stories, memory, being cunning to the enemy, and other courses in facing and althcare. Brave, though it is also careful in carrying information especially in relation to the counting of the woman who kidnapped his father until the husband's husband pretended to be the dead, until the discovery of the written biography of student activists. What is said to be the immediate reason why the Dula will be able to contradict the president of the US-Marcos dictatorship which is preparing the path for the burial of the Marcos in Malacanang. Also add up the memory to strengthen the fighting in the widespread murder and violation of human rights under Rodrigo Duterte. But more than that is the value and effect of "month and gun." In Response, Millado took a picture of a period of strong and strong struggle - not only against the dictatorship but for the entire rotten system - and to feature the said picture today. This is also like the commemoration of the earlier generation of activists and leaving the FQS. Our knowledge and understanding, we give inspiration and humilience about what they have done and it is possible to achieve that it is possible for now and Lam!! Carrying in the future. Who will be the one who said, you can't make a poem? It turns out that if a work of art is very beautiful and very credible, there is no explanation or study enough to make an idea. People should experience this. So I'm telling everyone: Watch the "moon and gun"! And it is better to tell those behind the Dula: Padaccording to the entire town! We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. While While While

We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. It took three decades before this published. Ka Luis of Manila Critics Circle was once honored by the author of Renato Constantino like the Mis-Education of the Filipino and Roots of Subservience. Aside from this, he is also a writer and companion. He became a member of the youth Makabayan in the decades of being sold, became a student, moved to the ranks of the workers, and he became a house in the line up to martial law. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Ka Luis stated the importance of Origin of the Family in the conflict. He said: "The Origin and other authors who belong to the so-called Marxist duck are offering a new perspective about social interaction. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. He stated that our current status is not eternal - that the world is not a "Valley of tears" which is our fate until the grave result of the "first wrongdoing." In the advancement of history, he added, the people will reach free, peaceful and prosperous life wherein no abuse of people in the people and the social development of everyone as the basis of the liberal development of each other. " For Ka Luis, the Origin is important to see the real traits of the state. He explains: "In Origin, it is saying that the state will go to the society but it will continue to separate. This is accepting that the society has a glamour of a rift, in the opposing sides or kind, and so that the society will not be crushed on their arguments, the state is necessary. The state, starting and hit, became a bit of a kind - in a variety. He became a furniture in abuse and oppression of those who have no assets - the masses of farmers and workers. " Although this, the Origin shows that sometimes the state of the people, which can be seen now in the speech of the Duterte government. According to Ka Luis: "I mentioned the Engels Solon that he pulled the pananda and put it on the ground and put the Griots who have been paid for debts and made slaves to other towns." However, Ka Luis also says that he does not know where Duterte can do his proposals. The six transactions in the country are deep in the inheritance of the colonists. He will clapping his transactions, he said, to solve criminality and traffic because they are also benefiting from it. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. "But we will know in endo or contractors what they will become. IT's Land reform and anti-mining. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Whatever, Duterte needs our whole support. The strong support of the people is his only wish to give four to the strength of transactions, local and foreign. " Not only Origin is the answer of Ka Luis. A few of these are communist Manlation of Marx and Engels, Wage, price, Profit and Wage-Labour's Capital of Marx, The German Ideology of Marx, a few episodes of the Anti-Duhring of Engels, and The Woman Question of Lenin. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Now, he is making the Condition of the working Class in England of Engels. It was amazing, but the transfer of his personal interests, and in 1976 he started. We speak to Ka Luis, "I am having a hard time to understand the works that are published in the foreign language. I need to consult the predictions that I am reading, that is why I am making the Filipino language in the Filipino language. " Many of the translation of Ka Luis is a letter-hand or now, and labelled. There are also those who will be lost, or against the current rat or anay. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. "I also cannot deny that there is an interest to release the author."

Is it just fair to do this in places destructed by typhoon Yolanda wherein thousands have lost their lives and livelihood? Stop President. Noynoy is saying that the reason is he wants to be with the victims of cruel nature because it is not true. If President wants it. Aquino to be with them to show his sympathy, it would have been long since most of them have already recovered from the help of foreigners and private people. What did the government help through the trust of PNoy? Well, most of them really got money from. How can the President and the assemblies say that they have helped the recovery of the victims when many are still protesters because instead of helping them, they became a victim. No one can be proud of the Aquino administration that has been done in the Philippines. It turns out that they were wrong, they were able to do something - the poor and to have money from the rich, especially the members of the KKK who respond to relatives, friend, Kaklase and Kabarilan. Instead of making progress, the country is getting worse in poverty. And so that not to be irritated, PNoy is touring the Filipinos. Wait a wait. Is it that PNoy is just afraid to meet in the "conflict" the personalities who play an important role in the People Power Revolution? So if they unite to do the People Power and oust Noynoy.

After two days, the Navy once again gave assistance to another vehicle that this time was a yacht that was destroyed and there was a board of foreign tourists near Negros Oriental. No one was reported hurt in this incident and the Navy successfully saved the victims. It can be recalled that in the past few months, the Navy was instrumental in the Disaster Response operations after the earthquake in Negros and Cebu and before it was in the typhoon in Iligan and Cagayan de Oro.

"I opened a few establishment who did not open a payment for watching Manny because of the suspicion that they will not earn. It's because it's because it's because the first fight is shown by Pacman. Before, in the past, their customers are just going to fight early in order to watch because Manny works on his opponent. Together with this is the order of the audience of their goods to eat, drinks and over the fight, is still there, who have been in prison but have been in prison. The last fight, since Manuel Marquez went to sleep, is a sign of the lack of "excitement" in his fight. No matter what comes to us with news, there are already many places that the former giving free live movie of Pacman became "greedy." "Even in the big municipal and cities, there may be two or three areas of free theaters for citizens.

Included in those who save this is a total of 4,200 Overseas Filipino Workers who can be found in the said country and the Sierra Leone and Gunia. These countries, parekers, are being attacked by no medicines and deadly Ebola and the governments have declared that their situation is a national emergency that is their situation with the amount of dying of them. The government of the Philippines should imitate the other countries who have their own citizens from the said countries before they get tired of those who are sick and die. For many instances, always late, parasoy, the government of saving OFWs in the ongoing war in different countries until they are getting caught, including the government. It can be considered as the same as the strength of the severe war that needs forcibly evacuations. If the government is not quick to decide and take action, it is scary to think that it will only take action if someone was infected and killed by an OFW. Like what happened after Libya was beheaded by a male OFW and to rape a Filipina nurse. If the government does not act for it and the Philippine Contingent of OFWs and those who are infected with them, it is scary when they are divided. It should be said that the government does not have any ability to fight Ebola. Maybe it is possible that they are still pests. Eric Tsailing when we were able to enter it.

Kalakhan to us, there is no innocent or not yet alive during the time of the base military of the United States in the Philippines. We did not see the American soldiers who are parked in Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Complex. We are not about to witness how our country will be placed in danger of the discretion of the United States in Vietnam and Korea. It was reported that America has hidden weapons in our country before. But we were able to catch the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) and Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) for the force to force them to force the Americans to be based in the country. We saw the Chinese presence in the islands of Independence (Spring Islands) and Bajo de Massimo (Scarborough Shoal). We saw how America and China are hostile to control the South China Sea or West Philippine Sea and entering their big warship in our ocean. The display of China's display on the island of Independence is also clear in the construction of facilities in the islands. The Filipinos will not be able to fish in our ocean because of the threats of the Chinese. And don't forget the destruction of our national wealth to the Tubbataha in Palawan last 2013 because of the implementation of the USS Guardian that has hit almost 4,000 square meters of garbage. There is also the disposal of a poisonous chemical in our sea and violation of the rights of the people every time the annual Balikatan military exercises. At the time that our national Independence will be put in danger because of the entry of foreigners, it is our duty as the people standing up and defend the country from invasion and violation of our freedom and sovereignty. The movement of the people in the early part of the decade "90 is staying at the base of America in our country and we continue to objected to the VFA and EDCA. We will not allow the headquarters of their weapon and force to launch a war in Asia-Ocean. We also do not make the discretion of China in our territory. The Philippines is for Filipinos and never for any foreigners. It is called time for the youth and people who have love and concern for the If Bayan. To defend his wealth and nature, his freedom and Independence from foreign corruption and destruction behind. The role of the youth is important for our call and fight. The young age is not a hindrance in the national release like our heroes, Andres Bonifacio and Emilio Jacinto, who are all in their youth when launching a revolution against Spanish. That's why it is better for us to go and take action this 12 June in the embassy of China in Makati and the United States in Manila. Show our unity in fighting for foreigners and insist on our Independence. Take IT in the upcoming Independence referendum.

Because in the day of Christmas, the tax-exemption of balikbayan boxes that the content is worth P150,000 per OFW or returnees. If you notice, we did not say that P150,000 per box but per OFW or returnees because P150,000 is the total Value of tax exemption per delivery or home. 12.50K total so, you might think there will be MORE than three boxes, the Value of every one box is 12.50,000 or total of P450,000 for three boxes. That is not like that, okay? Anyway, the administration has given a huge favor of the tax exemption of P150,000 because before, only 10,000 pesos is the Value of the contents of the balikbayan boxes that cannot be restored. Just the same, for every year, the OFW or balikbayan box tax exemption three times is possible. Thrice so, in a year, with the three availability of the privilege, it can P450,000 worth of goods which can be tax exempt. The privilege is not absolute because there is a conditions imposed so that the tax exemption will not be used in smuggling the goods. The conditions should be personal effects on the contents of the balikbayan box or "the items used (secondhand) or if before, personal belongings of the one sent or sent. Non-commercial does not have a commercial to be sent. For example, ita-tax "is the Customs of P150,000 worth of perfumes in your box or even P150,000 worth of alcohol. To be safe, you will just be swayed by maximum two items per category. For example, two bottles of perfumes and two bottles of alcohol.

The next regulations of the military like proper clothes, cut and losses are showing a unique discipline which is expected in a professional organisation. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. It is important to follow the same standard of cut and uniform are important for a military unit so that this is to maintain a unique unit pride, disciplinary standard, and comradeship of the troops. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Since serving the Philippine Army in 1897, the regulations are slowly written like the right-cut and uniform. General Antonio Luna is known for a vicious leader in the field of making discipline, including wearing a proper uniform and cut military. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The American soldiers knocked on the level of discipline military when the USAFFE was born before the second civil war.

In the 1950s, the soldiers Scout rangers were allowed to make their hair and hitter the bandits because of them, the sensitive mission is being searched by the bandits and the killing of its leaders. In fact, the Museum of Msburgt Francisco Camacho Chinl Weenee Martillana made the murder of the terror leader of the bandit Huk, Eddie Villapando, because they have put their hair and pretended to be civilians while on the mission. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The Scout rangers also used to make the hair back in the 1970s and 1980s because of the 'special' mission where they can compete with ordinary people in the government to be found. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. During the flaws. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. For me, the discipline of the soldiers should be distributed again like the proper appearance of a professional soldier. First, the use of extending the hair is missing while on the mission because of the experiences of enemies in the tactic of going to war with soldiers in the past few seasons. For example, the mission of the Museum is' Strike mission '(direct action mission) and is not the same with the Special Forces who are living in the government and organised by CHDF or CAFGU to defend people from the bandits. It's just a Common sense that the Special Forces will just be seen with those who lose their acceptance of them. Those who are killed in the culture of Filipino Muslims can register by bigote so it is also practical to imitate their appearance as agreement to their culture. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Second, even if the hair of the soldiers can be seen, they do not know how to talk about the words of our countrymen in the area. Extending the hair or bigote is more unlikely to be useful if the bandits have already learned other words and countersigns. Now, the stories of going to war is now on the internet now, including the insurgency warfare. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Third, everyone should heed what is stated in the AFP Transformation Roadmap where the administration desires to 'adopted and proud of the Filipinos'. Who is a good Filipino for proud of the American soldier who is the bandits Abu Sayyaf or NPA? We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Fourth, the good leader should have a broad perspective and learn from the experiences. Sometimes, you cannot identify who is the soldier or bandits in the encounter if they mix up the different units. This is my bitter experience when I talked to the students of SR Class 145 who were encountered by the bandits Abu Sayyaf in Tuburan, Basilan last year 2002. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Finally, there is no direct connection between the hair and courage. When I was a Tennis, I completed the group of soldiers who do not want to get hurt and I headed as the spearhead of the operations against Abu Sayyaf. In the fight, I can see the 'warrior' tree or a coconut tree. It also did not last long, you want to get some of the bandits. That's just a form. As of now, my opinion to those who take care of hair is fabulous and just form this familiar story. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Therefore, I Can't agree with your crooked beliefs and arguments about pushing the bandits. If you force you, volunteer immediately be an assault element always on your unit. It will be better if you will be a leader, beside the fight and I will be about to be the 'warrior' based on your appearance. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

This past week, a US Navy supply ship almost cannot anchor because Global does not want to anchor. Because they are not the ones talking to the Americans for the services he needs. The US Navy has its own bidding on public service and supply but wants to take all Global voices from Subic, particularly the former SRF compound, the anchor of the ship, based on its contract. It is not expected that the Americans will not expect all of these kinds of Global voices because aside from the liberal business, there is a particular need that this will not be given by the Global and of course, it is natural to socialize. Global voices have been strong because of the much-known contacts in the Senate like Senator Loren Legarda who is from Malacañang and even presidential sister Kris Aquino, who recently visited the Segara Hotel owned by Global, associate and family Gordon, who is also inside the SRF compound.

By Amelyn mice several months passed when I saw newspapers the news that this was a student of UP who committed suicide. What are his parents? "I am also a parent because I am also a parent and I feel what the children's parents feel like that. It is painful for a parent to be criticized as if they do not have any action to injure the needs and tuition of their child. I am sure if this child hears the accusation that "that is his parents, he is probably angry. I am sure that they have done something - they are not lucky to achieve what they want to give to their child. If the government is also responsible for the education of the youth, they should not reach that situation. I have no child to think about suicide or stop studying because of not able to provide for his needs as a student. I believe that no parent will not do anything just for the needs of their children. I am one of my parents, who will do everything for the future and dreams of her child. I do not care even if I judge me by other people or tried to stop me. I am not a perfect person. I also have a bad feeling in life. But the important thing is, I have a clean goal. Not everyone he is seeing is suspected and not all suspects are true. My child "is my child and I am ready to be brave because he is only able to finish studies. "I will not allow it to suffer because he has a payment for tuition or no fare to enter school. The child was deeply hurt by the events, which is why he could not handle it and he finally killed his own life. I hope we have learned from what happened. "We don't know where the strength or weakness of our children until they experience a severe problem in life. And painful, too much pain, of feeling for a parent, if they cannot do anything more than what they have done and accused them that they are irresponsible parents. Four years have passed, he took up and nine months from now, my child of ums will be cut off. I do not want to spend money for him as a parent, because he is hardworking and has dedication to studying. That is why I need to persevere and make it hard to keep on, sell a load, sell a load, sell the old clothes - all that I tried and even writing, I will be able to earn money. I am doing this because I am a mother who has a simple dream for her children - I see that they have a good life. And least, even if I lose the world, they will not forget that their parents are not responsible for giving them proper education. If the government should be the same as a responsible and good parent in French people like UP, this is a big help to those like Kristel, to those like my child, and for many youth.

DOH is now calling for all other branches of the government to help in the fight of the disease that can return and deadly. Among those implicated by the DOH is the Department of Education and local government who helped him. Even the private doctors, nurses and other medical professionals are also called to help. DOH says many medicines are saying that there are many and sufficient vaccine against measles. But it is only now that this becomes clear because of the ranks of barangay health centers, the statements about the lack of vaccination should be ound. That is why, many of the barangay health centers are going to walk for a vaccination in spite of the truth that every day there was a child who was born to be born in the set time. It appears that the DOH or the government is lying or the government itself is about having enough vaccination for the disease without certain medicines. No doctor, there is no nurse experience of all the excessive lack or lack of appropriate health professionals in barangay health centers.

Included in those who are paying for are not only the medicine for the vaccine but only a few belongings, bulk, consultation and very setting. The lack of vaccine to admit it or not by the government, the people are not able to make their lives comfortable. The families in the barangay will be counted among the fingers at the barangay, saying that life will be light and they can get a vaccine in private clinics or hospitals. That is why, the father and mother are forced to find a source of income to "finish" just in daily expenses. Especially now that they have spread contrast, which can be sure that they will be able to order for five months and it reaches a year before they find the refrigerator of the work caused by contralization. The government itself is the subject of contrast to its creation of the law for this, called Herrera Law.

So many reports in AlDub Nation, I will just widen a little. At first I watch Alford, like you, I said to myself, fame is a different kind of fame. It is not expected, not imagined, accident, just happened. But I do not believe that all of these just appeared, from where, like no one came from, especially in the case of Yaya Dub, Maine Mendoza. I have read a book that the title is the Outliers. The point of the book is the arrival of the right time for something. The book said: 'You need to spend and least 10,000 hours a thing you want before you become an expert on that matter. For example, the book says, the Beatles or Justin Bieber - the story has been overnight. But what many don't know, they have made it a lot of years for their craft before they became famous. In the case of Yaya Dub, Maine is still young, where he is "dubbed" he is. I thought, what was the comments of Maine Mendoza about what he did on YouTube since then. Yaya Dub has not been easy with the parents of Yaya Dub to understand what kind of craft that he chose - but we look at what we've achieved today, right! But it is not "overnight" ation. Maine Mendoza made the "dubsmash" within a long time. What might have been "overnight" is the vetting of Alden Richards. My point is that this is the message for anyone whose popularity or success in the modern field is not really "overnight" but as a result of a long time of preparation and waiting at the right time. Mark Zuccberg, for example, is the founder of Facebook, from a young boy, he has already described his ability to computer and coined people.

In the 6th Commencement Exercises for the Drug Enforcement Officers Basic course in PDEA Gymnasium, PDEA Director General Undersecretary Arturo Cacdac Junior is very happy with the 67. Some of them are sensible and some of them will deliver the way towards harm? The drugs and plague of society are not unknown to us, that is why many are sensible and respected individuals who are involved in drugs. Is this not the problem of PDEA, some of these who are proud of Cacdac? Lily's Files reports that hopefully there is no small path to the new agent.0or once I spoke to some tricycle drivers of different Toda in Quezon City and they said that many of the drivers are "addicts" in drugs. We believe in what our interviewed said, especially those who are together. Why does the Toda Officers do not do anything if they know that their members are using drugs? Why do they need to play blind in these vices of drivers? Can they still wait for accident or an accident? It would have been okay if only they will be hurt. What if they even have no idea that passengers will be involved, especially the children? Hopefully, in the tricycle operators, before they accept their drivers, they should know if they are involved in drugs or they should know if they are using them.

MATERIAL_BASE-1B_52155657 We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Fusion movie We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. By Rolando B. Tolentino July 25, 2012 We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Reporting by Tamim (Oracle, 2012) We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. On June 29 to July 3, 2012, the Film Development Council of the Philippines was organized once again throughout the Philippines. From the 120-funded description, you can choose 15 for the feature film - five in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao-to be named, and 10 are finished and shown in the festival. One of the things I liked, but the other judges did not notice the Tamim. It was revealed in the short story of Macario Tiu, this is about a teacher in elementary school with husband who is very whole. A symbol of the powerful catholic Church and modernity, the teacher was worried about treatment of a shaft chapel. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. In his anger, even the traditional destruction of the altar of the offer) was destroyed by the teacher. When her husband had a problem in giving birth, and because of the heavy rainfall, the teacher was forced to go to the shaman. The drinking is to heal because of his conversation with the old cell phone with Sir Sandpity, and it was found out that the Sir was angry because the teacher destroyed it. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Dancing to the teacher in the downpour of rain to remove the anger of Sir. The movie is good, there is no more definition in the form but was able to ad a story from the region that is common, we cannot see in other movies. Even in the current indie Cinema, only Sherad Anthony Sanchez, Teng Manganski, and Arnel Mardowned, is leading to sharing images and stories from the region. I let them tell them the weight of revealing the story of you in Mindanao-Wan. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. This is a unique movie of Oracle, together with three more films from Mindanao batch of the first inning Pambansa - because of the influx of stories from the most under-represented region in the boom of indie Cinema. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. However, there are two issues that should be considered in the movie contestants in the Batasang Pambansa. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. First, the search and use of material from the region as an impetus to the aim of the movie. In the case of Tamim, it came from a duck enclosure from the writer of the region, and the author needs to transform the audiovisual media. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The ability of the film is its capacity to create an ambitious space which is familiar is not familiar. Or in the case of under-represented heels, the unfamiliar story is being made. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Although the location, a person, and courted, in the actual region, what will be thought will be the province of Rizal, Nueva Ecija or Quezon. The quality is not unique - the visibility - and so, the intrusive material in the media of the movie is not unique. The particular request for non-Metro Manila story and movie is to make the audiovising material. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. It is not at the level of exhibition that is like a tarta of the Department of Tourism but at the level of etnograph space. What I am thinking about here is the audiovisors of the former Davao airport in the movie of Sanchez and Robin Fargo, Baltimore (2010) that has a hint of contrast to the inequality and coming-out. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The wing issue is the text of the movie. Tammy was absolutely dependent on the Tiu's story, it is not absolutely effective in the media of the film the three dimensic opportunities of staff (biolohires, and social media), and like the said familiarity of the unfamiliar location and tags of the story. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The second issue is about the lack of transfer of knowledge in the area, and most of all, to the staff that is being provided by the film. If this is a movie she found in Metro Manila, many givens that do not need to be discussed. But because this is an emotional film, many givens are needed to lay out by the filmmaker: Your relationship with foreign teachers and indigenous people, pregnancy as a person in remote areas, and others. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. In the film, the treatment of the diegesis is also a foreigner who missed the development of diegesis that miss the social and subscription motivation for domestic relationships in the movie. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. IT needs, however, for most studies in the community to suggest the integral motivation to the movie, especially if IT comes from the region. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. It should be considered that the media of the movie is focused towards the feature of the situation that will build all the elements of the scene he had to write to the filmmaker. If there is no absolute disruption, there is absolutely no former climax, and it is sad to say, of a total movie. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The potential is not an analysis, and this is the first danger of the emotional filmmaker (patience) which is an absolute appropriate term): There is a higher education and schemes for details of the participants. That is why it is included and screaming to the national hero (national Cinema) because this is the one that is not being served in the dynamics of making movies in the country. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Before we can make a movie, it is time to study the society taking advantage of the story of the movie. In other words, we can stop and study the society. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

Missing name on official list of voters Missing signal. Wrong quick counts. This is the scene of the election yesterday, May 13. Not included here are the incidents of violence, harassment, and other irregularities, from voting until the closing of voting, sending a result of the votes in the precinct until the Commission on Elections (Comelec) in the local and national level. In some of the worst places in Metro Manila and nearby towns, the tap and volunteer of Pinoy Weekly witnessed these problems. On Twitter feed from the hashtag # Buvote2013, we were also reported to monitor the anti-continents like Bulatlat.com, Tudla, Kodao, Davao Today, and others. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Reports of conservative groups watching the election also entered the province. Through reports, the appearance of the election showed that the irregularities and problems were shown. More than an hour after the elections closed, the Parish Pastoral Council for responsible voting (PPCRV), official citizen arm of COMELEC in the election, the Partial and unofficial results from 1,418 precinct. With the outcome, it was seen that more than 14 million votes of the candidate for senator has the highest vote, Grace Poe. The election's reaction was immediately confirmed, that the statistical possibility of having more than 14 million votes. "(T) the PPCRV-KBP transparency server flashed on national television a numerically surprising total of around 10 million votes for the top senatorial spot while reporting only a total of 1,418 precincts. The erset is significant, as a maximum of 1,000 voters per precinct should only yield a total of around 1,418,000 maximum votes, "Kontra daya said. The PPCRV revoked the said count, and it was said that there was a format that was supposedly done, and they have fixed the said problem. The Kontra daya reported that Smartmatic immediately fixed the source code in their part as a reply to the release of a huge vote that is not realistic. To adjust the vote; less than 4.8 million votes were taken by Poe after the Adjustment. But the PPCRV also did not explain how to get this figure. It can be recalled that this happened last 2010, when it reached a point that the total registered voters reached 153 million in the counting of the Philippines before. Smartmatic immediately fixed the source code. Suspicious for the Kontra daya is the sudden fixing of Smartmatic in the source code that is used in counting and processing of votes. According to them, Smartmatic should be buried from the source code, and this can change the source code. This is despite the lack of real source code review of counting the consolidation (CCS). "(T) he public Can never know the Smartmatic's system for counting the canvassing of votes really. It appears that they can also change the source code on the spot, which makes the Whole election system a questionable exercise, "said Kontra daya. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Meanwhile, the suspicion that an official of Smartmatic should add to the data center of the PPCRV in the Pope Pence Center in Manila before the wrong tally in the afternoon of May 13, the AES Watch said. Ernie del Rosario, IT expert of the AES Watch and former IT director of COMELEC, said that the presence was worrisome in the afternoon in the PPCRV of Albert Castro Rico, which is a global service direct of Smartmatic in Asia Ocean. He is also the project manager of the foreign technology supplier in the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) in 2008, and one of those signed on the contract for the poll automation between Comelec and Smartmatic. Nelson Celis, Co-convener of the AES Watch and former president of the Philippine Computer Society, Del Rosario. He said, "Smartmatic has no business dealing with a citizens" arm that should exercise Independence especially from a foreigner. Mister Castro should explain what he was doing there. " "This is no other reason I know why Smartmatic's top operations are, and the PPCRV will be able to know from Smartmatic's CCS (consolidated counting system)?" Said Celis. Del Rosario said that any connection with a foreign company in the operation of the civic arm of COMELEC in the election is suspicious and should be serious to investigate. Del Rosario of Comelec technical working Group in Poll Automation in 2008 resigned because of the fact that the COMELEC or the officials of the COMELEC regarding the quality of autism elections should be implemented. In the press conference by the PPCRV today, Henria de Villa said that the presence of Rico of Smartmatic should not be an issue on their data center. It is said that Smartmatic should really have been there to observe the process. Ana De Villa Singson, media director of the PPCRV, said that they will also be found in the actual data center for the transparency of Smartmatic. In the reports in midya and in the statements of the PPCRV, they seem to say that the problem with the wrong tally should not be an issue. The COMELEC also said that "small fraction" only of 78,000 an S machines in the same number of polling precincts were destroyed. Comelec Chair Sixto Brillantes said that up to 200 were destroyed.

MATERIAL_BASE-1B_77425728 Be armed with information on the campaign against illegal drugs, January 21, 2017 in the ongoing campaign against illegal drugs, it cannot be denied that this fight of the Duterte government is slowly being caught. Despite the government, particularly the Philippine National Police (PNP), there are still many things to clean, the success of war against illegal drugs is already felt. However, despite the perceived success in the campaign of illegal drugs, it is sad that the force that is destroying the good goal of the PNP to sweep the involved in illegal drugs. This is due to the involvement of some officials and personnel of the PNP in the kidnapping and murder of the Korean businessman arrested using the campaign "Oplan Tokhang." It is clear from the information coming out that the group involved in the crime was used in the illegal drugs of the government to earn because it was a huge amount of money from the businessman's camp in exchange for freedom but eventually discovered that there was no life. These kinds of events are alarm so it is important for the public to be alert to the syndicates or corrupt cops using Oplan Tokhang or Oplan Tapper of PNP in their illegal activities. That is why it is important for us to be armed with knowledge about the right process of the campaign of the government so that it won't reach the fate of the businessman. As part of the process is the formal invitation to an individual, especially if there is a complaint through letters. The police cannot force him to invite because they have the right to invite to refuse and get a lawyer to defend. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

Tweet We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. I received a tip from a trusted source about the sidelines of a new syndicate that is moving here in the country. This syndicate is composed of some corrupt individuals from China who introduce themselves as an expert in treatment and healing of people who are sick of cancer. And because of this in the Philippines, they are automatic that they have an accomplice of course, of course they are Filipinos who are the doctors. The sidelines of the syndicate was hit in big hospitals where there are rich patients who are sick of cancer. If they have found a target victim, they will talk to him and with the help of the Filipinos who often travel to China, they will introduce an experiment or cancer treatment specialist from the said country. And because of the sales Talk of these fools, it is certain that they convince the desperate patients to go to the country to have a treatment of their disease. What's worse here is to spend millions of patients but when they return they will not get healed. Instead, their situation becomes more severe than before, and if they are unfortunate, they might have a corpse to be taken back home. In other words, a clear fraud is being done by the syndicate that I heard was built by a clinic and there in Makati so that their tasks might look legitimate. Until now, there is still no cure for many kinds of cancer and this is the advantage of this syndicate to earn and give false hope for those suffering from patients. That is why I am calling for Health Secretary Enrique Ona and to the management of the Philippine Medical Association (PMA) and even the National Bureau of Investigation and Philippine National Police to investigate the lies of the said syndicate of cancer treatment scam.

Our children have our attitude that we do not like, no choice, but accept their whole character because they are already released by their mother,.... it is impossible that they will return to her womb. Even in our own personality, we also have characteristics that we do not like that's why we are envious of others.

MATERIAL_BASE-1B_93619941 Editorial: The ISF is a big challenge! Vice President Leni Robredo explained yesterday that it is not just construction of agriculture to be the solution to the problem of informal settler families or ISF. He visited various Housing projects in the past Housing czar and he was crushed by what he saw. There was a vacancy and one was forced. Abandoned. No one wants to live. Waste! If counting, billions of pesos is spent on housing projects. How did it happen that many have no own homes and will persevere to sleep on the road or under the bridges but do not want to live in the vacant housing project of the government? A new match? Just like "there are vacant jobs and new graduate students. Many applicants and there are also vacant jobs but the two problems are not similar to it. This is also the situation of the housing project of the government and ISF that will try harder in Metro Manila and big cities. That is why VP Leni is talking about, just do not build a house and roof their heads. They need, in the community where they will transfer, there is electricity and water. The economy is important. It means, there are businesses that they can attend. It is also the main ingredients for a resettlement site or housing project is the cheap transportation and near public school which will serve as a "playground" of their children. Even if they are homeless and ISF, they are also thinking of course of the situation of their family in the available relocation. It should really be, they can live in a new house. This will be complete and their ambition and dreams for the family will be fulfilled. Not even if there is a roof, there is an automatic bite of those who will be transferred to. If this is how big the problem of a Housing czar, it is sad that instead of increasing the budget of the office of VP Leni can be cut off. Despite this, the Vice President gladly accepted the smaller OVP budget in the coming year 2017. But hopefully, the "Housing program" will be given a separate fund "even if it is not directly placed in the office of VP Leni. There is a lot to do with this problem. Others can't even see, the "Declaration" of Metro Manila or the transfer of ISF towards new communities outside the city is copyright in many problems such as the congested traffic, problem of environment (pollution, garbage, flood) and even the crime rate. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

By Pher Pasion February 9, 2012 We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. These members of health are furious because of the Aquino administration's frustration with the benefits they are asked for. (Pher Pasion) "Policy decision" will decrease their left benefits. This is the response of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) in the call of the health workers to recover the plan to reduce their left benefits. In a conversation with the health workers, including the Alliance of Health Workers (AHW), DBM insisted that they can lessen the benefits of these members. It is said that this is based on the Department of Health Memorandum Order Number 2012-Eclipse 2 which is ordered to lessen the alawans in the laundry of the employees. Under the said memorandum, the said alans will be 130 per cent to 150 pesos. Meanwhile, it will also take care of 50 pesos per day of making 30 pesos in allowance of ordinary employees in institutions and programs of the government. DOH also said that the memorandum is based on DBM Budget memorandum Nos. 107 and 112 giving rules in preparation of budget for different agencies in the year 2012 and 2013. "If the government's aim is to remove all the benefits of Magna Carta like what the representation of DBM in the previous consultation and meetings, we will not allow it to happen," according to Emma Manuel, president Emeritus of AHW and the ologic technologist in Tondo Medical Center. The health expert explained that Manuel is anxious, causing the "anxious and demoralization of the law that are going to go directly to the law." He also said that like other citizens, the health workers and services are already being affected by non-stop increase of goods and services, and they need any additional benefits given by the government. AHW, the command of the DOH and memo of DBM in Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Magna Carta of Public Health Workers who were update on Nov. 1999. It is stated in the said rules and regulations that the government needs to allocate 150 per cent of laundry allowance and 50 pesos per day (or P1,500 every month) that will be implemented. They also said that "this is contrary to the provisions of the Joint Resolution number 4 or Salary Standardation Law III (SSL III) that prohibits employees, joining the benefits stated in Magna Carta" the said orders of DOH and DBM. "If you want to lessen why not those in the top?" According to Dante Perez, who uses health from the Philippine Orthopedic Center. Perez also said that the (majority of) officials in the government was not in the hospital for treatment. "That's why they cannot see it and they cannot feel the situation of ordinary patients. "They do not feel poverty in public schools," he said. Perez said that the day might come that there will be no health care in the Philippines if this situation continues to low wages, lack of benefits and lessen. "We can't resist to leave those who need our service even if our salary is low. Yes. "When we entered service for the Filipinos but do not let us go," Perez said. For Amalia Magno of Amang Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center: "It is very painful to think that we loved our job in spite of low wages and poor conditions, but we did not love this government." Protest calls for AHW to fill the hospitals in different form such as hanging streamers, ribbon and even noise barrage in order to have a "atmosphere of protest" in resistance to the said disaster. "We have grown old in service. But we do not see any changes but continue to extort and suffer, "said Remy Ysa of Tondo Medical Center who has 38 years in service. "We will be organised and charged by the government of this government. We don't have any reliable. "Life and livelihood is being removed from all of us," said Your.

MATERIAL_BASE-1B_25752372 Peace to fight We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Such a waste that the New People's Army will not be solved immediately to the call of President Rodrigo "Digong" Duterte for the ceasefire in the war. It can be recalled that Pang was first declared. Digong of the ceasefire against the NPA on the day of his State of the Nation Address but it was revoked because of an ambus made by the rebels in a group of armed forces of the government in Davao del Norte. The President gave an extension for the explanation of the rebels in the incident until 5: 00 in the afternoon two days ago but the NPA still failed to respond. On the other hand, the NPA said that the forces of the government conducted an operation despite the order of the ceasefire of the President and they just defended themselves. In the end, Joma Sison said that President Rodrigo "Digong" Duterte was able to finish first because it was 8: 00 in the evening before the declaration of the NPA ceasefire or three hours before Pres. Digong is the unilateral ceasefire. In the middle of these events, it seems that the intention and steps towards peace talks will not lead to nothing but the ceasefire is just one of its content. No one else displaced President. Duterte on his steps in what he wants to end the civil war that has already killed 30,000 people since March 29, 1969 that the NPA will be strong. The person who took it back to the ceasefire were the policies on how the ceasefire will be implemented and it is normal for the order to continue the fight of the forces of the NPA. It is part of the fact that the President is not taking advantage of it while we are still the scheduled conversation between the rebels and the government in Oslo, Norway for peace talks. The President also did not leave the appointment of the leftist groups in some high positions of the government. So, there is hope that the search of the way towards peace and unity of both sides will still push through. There really are those who cannot avoid incidents or mistakes that are also happening even in the way like this issue. It remained in one of the things we are looking at which is still a big possibility of having an agreement with the leadership of the communist Party of the Philippines, National Democratic Front and NPA for this. They reveal the difference between the President to other past Presidents that are really different from the interest of the masses and the country. The President now, in their opinion, can accommodate even the first step towards change in society that they want to happen. "If the current president has a big impact on the millions of poor people they are fighting for. Together with the restrictions of millions of poor are destroying the policies of contract that will rule the greedy and opportunist capitalists against workers and the big reason for the suffering of them. There is also the right to correct the destructive and illegal mining that has a twin who will increase the protection of the miners than the protection of citizens and nature. The President also shows a strong conviction against the meddling of foreigners in governance in the country. That's why in our belief, the other group is still holding on the belief that there is no reason not to push up and achieve permanent peace for the whole country. Matches and gasoline This in these times, the matches and gasoline are just next to each other. The revolution or war is like gasoline that is easily caught on fire. Now, the revolution or war is resting despite the problem in the ceasefire. Hopefully, everyone does not handle matches and it will be more not to make a margin and throw gasoline to the fire matches. Digong said: While both sides of the dead are in great need for each other, what he sees is the pitiful situation of those who are widowed and orphaned and the country that has long been struggling because of war. He added that if both parties will not do it now, the hatred of hatred for each other is not prevailed. Peace in support will only mean everything is the call to ourselves that we won't be a hindrance to unity, unity, peace and extensive change. We should also avoid getting out of matches and threw it to the gasoline of the revolution to get caught on fire on each other. The 30,000 killed in the war and the more people who suffer and losing the future because of the revolution. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

In the said porum of Pilgrims for Peace and Song Cahrihl on March 19, various sectors have insisted that the two sides will need to be able to answer the roots of the armed conflict. Nilo's story is common. The soldiers were kidnapped and imprisoned by the suspicion that he is a member of the New People's Army (NPA). The harassment was supposedly started when they built a group, government of the natives of Batiawan, to fight for the ancestors in the midst of the threat of a businessman. "We just want to insist on our rights. But we accused the NPA, "he said. Similar victims of violation of human rights are leading the call of President. Benigno Aquino III with a serious return to the peace talks. According to Duterte, he would have been molested again because of the moving GPH from the earlier protests against the Spanish government. Boris for the traction and Alliance in the statement of Duterte recently, he stated how the "historic meeting" of President Aquino and Jose Ma. Sison, the founder of the communist Party of the Philippines, in Hanoi this year. Sek himself. Ronald Llamas, political adviser of the president, made his proposal in a press conference in Amsterdam last November 2012. Lloyds promised Alan Jazmines and other Malaysian Consulate members, and that Jazmines will be the participants of the said meeting. According to Jasig (Joint Agreement on Security and immunity Guards), Duterte insists on the release of the GPH of 14 detained Malaysian Consulate. Back in 2011 he filed the Aquino administration for a general declaration for the traction of the Alliance, under the so-called Special track of the peace talks. The Special track is the negotiation between the two sides to speed up the peace talks. But according to NDFP, until now, the GPH has not submitted anything to a point-by-point answer to this. Instead, Aquino only gave a short message that sells a ceasefire without a clear basis. To discuss the proposed meeting of Aquino and Sison in Hanoi, the two sides gathered at The Hague on December 17-18. The GPH of borne Common Declaration for National Unity and a Just Peace. Duterte puts some of this point, including the lack of clarity on how to put the Committee on National Unity, Peace and Development which has been submitted by economists and conservative reforms. The GPH also sets an immediate ceasefire, although the reforms that will be done are not yet applied. Meanwhile, NDFP has submitted his own borne General Declaration for National Unity and a Just Peace. He clarified that the committee for the reforms will be put on the same number of representation from the two sides. The basis of the traction and Alliance are also presented. Included here is the represented of all non-equal agreement and states that is against the national sovereignty. As well as the real reforms in land and national indings.

Together with the program in reform in the land is the projects that livelihood in the communities to increase the production of agriculture, while projects in the industry are starting to start. After the "historic meeting" but in the said meeting in The Hague, the representation of the GPH said that they are not authorized by President Aquino to sign any agreement. Llamas became elusive when he asked the Duterte administration about his promise to Gain Jazmines and other Malaysian institutions that they are not authorized to discuss such things. The two sides gathered again on February 25 and 26 in Amsterdam. The Duterte administration is preparing a Draft Communizon for the meeting of Aquino and Sison in Hanoi. But the GPH said they have no mandate to discuss the said borders. The GPH is also at the table with his own borne declaration that the Duterte administration will again join again. The priority of the Duterte administration is the placing of the unilateral and indefinite ceasefire in front of the declaration, which is allegedly destroying the entire outline of negotiation. It is also stated by having the Final Peace Agreement, which according to Duterte, was neglected in the regular track of the peace talks, where there is a need to put the politics and economists to discuss the cessation of hosting or set aside weapons. Duterte also said that the GPH does not want to use the word "real reforms" and "national indicialization" because it is allegedly tainted by ideology (ideally charged). The peace talks collapsed when the Duterte administration who was only offered the meeting in Hanoi by Sison and Aquino to force it to abuse their side who agreed to the declaration of the GPH about the "non-ceasefire" in just one or two meeting. None of the government declared the word traction and Alliance which was the first proposed by Duterte. NDFP: Not closing the door We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

He said, the sincerity of continuous imprisonment of his fellow Malaysian Consulate. Malayao was locked for more than two years, and was liberated recently because the court decided that the cases against him have no basis.

MATERIAL_BASE-1B_14085890 We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Wednesday, April 11, 2012 We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Makauring awareness We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Different awareness. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Published as Editing by the Masa, April 16-May 15, 2012 We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Every May Day, SONA, November 30, and other actions, the cry of "uring International Workers, Hunt," and "fooled!" But no matter how Filipino workers understand the army to free the country from the understanding of the capital, that the release of the worker is on their own hands. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The problem of the worker is himself, because he still has no trust in his own strength. He still does not know his real strength, so he hasn't used it for his release and defending his interest, because the use and benefiting from the combined strength of the workers is the capitalists. The worker still does not know that he is feeding the whole world. The worker's confidence in business is clearly seen as "strength-making." This is the business that are being sold by millions of workers in capitalists every day, and produces a lot of money on the profit of capitalists while the salary of the workers remains. Filipino workers try to stop working and for sure to live in the factory, the running of economists of the country will stop, the entire capitalist system will stop. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. That is the strength of the workers that they haven't seen until now. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Because the worker thinks he is just a simple employee, simple workers who go back to their factory, factory or office to raise their own family in the development given by their capitalists or employer, they look at their jobs and income for the capitalists, that the capitalists are making them, when they are the ones who make the capitalists. The worker should know himself as aware of the kind. The worker still does not know that they are composed of a kind of society, which are all their interest in all of the same way to live, to be a slave to capitalists in exchange for the smallest salary, that they are all the same with their own creation. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The worker needs to know himself as a kind, because this is the first field of the fight, to free the minds of the workers from the bankot which is a mentality that is built by capitalist system in the whole country, in the whole world. In other words, the worker should not fit in the issue of rising wages, winning the living Wage, and being a good condition in the factory as the possible West slaves. Most of all, they should be aware of the workers who have a goal to crush their rivals, the kind of capitalists. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. As aware of the workers, what should be prepared for is the construction of a society that will be transferred to the rotten and eaten systems, the success of the dictatorship of the workers, to rebuild their scheduled society, the society that does not take advantage of the people, the society that does not take advantage of the people, the civic SOStory. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

Just like what happened to our countrymen in Zamboanga City that after the MNLF rebels will be helpful, destructed by the flood. In spite of the events, it emerged and made the stability, understanding and Unity of the Filipinos. In the name of the order to restore order and peace and according to the Philippine Defense Forum as and 28 SSeptember 2013, a total of 18 soldiers and five policemen risked their lives in less than 20 days of fighting. Meanwhile, 169 soldiers and 14 policemen were wounded. We heard different stories of heroism and sacrifice. For example, the Army 1Lt. Francis Damian and Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Jose audience Banares who are both included in the deceased. 1Lt is scheduled to take vacation. Damian just finished his Airborne course but he was volunteer to go with operations in Zamboanga City. PO2 Banares was scheduled to go home to R & R to his family but decided to stay in his unit and join the Navy Special operations. When the authorities found out that the soldiers and police need to cook food while fighting, "did not hesitate to prepare for packing food. Some of them are personally showing that of the forces of the government. Because of too many, the people need to give a schedule to not equal food. It was reported that Lola Norma Lincores was reported to be hit by a mortar in his home while cooking for the soldiers. Relief goods in the Philippine Navy said that the soldiers going up to BRP Benguet (LT 507) overflowed. Hopefully they will just bring them if it is not because of the onslaught of typhoon "Odette" in Northern Luzon. One by one, the relief goods for Zamboanga and the assistance for Batanes are one by one. After the mission in Batanes, the ship went to Zamboanga City. Aside from relief goods and medical assistance, different agencies of the government rallied to stress debriefing especially to children in evacuation centers. In cooperation with DSWD, the Navy Civil Military Operations Unit-Western Mindanao issued a movie joke and cartoons of Western Mindanao within a few consecutive nights that were absolutely angered by the evacuation centers of young or old. The Football for Peace clinic is the members of the Philippine Marine Corps for refugees in Zamboanga State Polytechnic College. What else and despite the fact that the huge part of Zamboanga City is down and still submerged in the whole world, its involvement in the whole world is beheading, stability and cooperation that is natural for Filipinos especially during the calamity. The preparedness in the ranks of soldiers and policemen will be considered to ensure themselves in danger even if they have a chance to avoid. The needs of additional readiness and skills of our government should be considered a lesson to ease, but to avoid, these kinds of translation in any part of the country.

We're going to get a lot MORE. Posted by: Jerry Yap on February 14, 2017 in opinion We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We are here for generations and times when many are thinking of problems than thinking about the solution. When President Rodrigo "Digong" Duterte started his war against illegal drugs, many asked, where the government who have surrendered and drug addicts are going to be brought when the government allegedly lacks drug rehabilitation facilities. President Digong had a solution when removing the Mega Drug Abuse Treatment and rehabilitation Center (MDACA) in Fort Magsaysay, Nueva Ecija for the help of a Chinese philantroist. But it is not really losing criticisms or comments that the President does not want to believe the syndicate of illegal drugs in the country. Before President Digong removed Oplan Tokhang at the hands of the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) many complained about the abuse of other people of the police. According to them, those who kill the suspected drug addicts and drug pushers are the hands of the syndicate. The total number reached 1,189,462 surrendered based on Rappler's report. The addicts that surrendered have reached 1,110,113 while the pushers were 79,349. Because Digong did not speed up and act on his cabinet, here is the new problem in the operation of the MDACA under the Department of Health (DOH) led by Secretary Paulyn Jean Rosell-Ubial. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Almost 127 patients from Bulacan and Nueva Ecija were being treated and being cared for in the MDACA, which said there was a capacity of 10,000 patients. The MDACA opened last 30 November 2016. But up to now 127 are undergoing rehabilitation. Secretary Ubial admitted that they are "caught flat-footed, unprepared" because of the speed of operation and many who have surrendered and pushers. But he considers the drug epidemic in the country is a "health problem." He said, "Abusers Are mental health patients WHO need to (be) cured." "Then, why is it that DOH is not able to hasten the process to put those who have surrendered and pushers who have surrendered? "The said billion-billion fund, why not use it to get doctors, nurses, ologists, social workers and therapists! Are all problems that will appear there in MDACA, they will pass it to President Digong before they think of a resolution? Where are those from DOH and DDB, who are always permitted to join any seminar and studies in other countries in relation to illegal drug abuse! Why don't they put it in the MDACA? President Digong is thinking about how to resolve the problem "?! Can you really do work there in MDACA, Secretary Ubial? Well, declare you early while there is a fund. You might raise your hand when you don't have funds and then you will shout "I gave up!" Thank you, Madam Secretary, "centerpiece" program of President Digong "that.

Marcos, who was initially appointed to the citizenship for 20 years using the iron fist. Because of the help and unity of the citizens, it was managed to be possible that it was impossible to kick out the dictator from power. But 28 years have passed after that incident, Filipinos seem to have no ego that became a good result of the historic event. Since then, until this time of President Noynoy, the country has already been the country and not count the elections, but the people are still in poverty. Back to normal and when corruption in different branches of the government and the evil spirits and behavior that we turned away before will come back and seems to be worse now than before. It is really a waste because we have not used that opportunity brought by the people power so that our country has been locked in poverty and chaos in our country. After we were happy to go away, we went back to his old practice and forget the word help and unity.

In the consecutive "bombing" in Mindanao last week, the children's children prevailed in the imagination of some of our countrymen. There is a suspicion that one of its allies is Napoles or its allies in the government. So that the media will keep the issue from ten billion pesos in scandal which is currently being feat by the public. In money, connection to the government and experience of the former military officer who is the wife of Napoles, what we can say is. However, it might be too much "extreme" this thing as a solution to their problem! There is also a suspicion that this may be a type of destabilation not to struggle with PNoy like the chaos during the time of his mother, but also a non-stop quake on his tenure. For if the bet of the palace is preparing to be preparing for 2016, Mar Roxas will prosper in the triate of Binay, Erap and Enrile! Hmile, Enrile? If possible, it seems like you have a mixture of "paranoia" that seems to be the definition of this! Hehehe. Just a moment, it is not the "justification" by Angregarding Sam du'n in their earlier warning against terrorism that caused the destruction of many of their embassy in the whole world? May, but that is if there is a deep step that is being cooked by aydol Barrack Obama and his CIA! There is also a suspicion that MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari is already having a tantrum because he will finally lose the charisma if he will let the "peace agreement" of the government and the MILF group. Possible! But, Nur is able to stomach many innocent civilians to die and get hurt just because of pride or ambition in power? Can it be done? Yes, it turns out that the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighter or BIFF is not owned by the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighter or BIFF. Hmile, the difficulty is to hold the words of Ameril Umbra Kato because the course of This brain is still unlikely to be MORE likely than clearing IT! Huh! As of now, almost all of us are all espoused because we do not know anything. Aside from the commentary on the series of bombings there in the "land promise." But only one is sure, some demons will benefit from what they did! Each of them! Whoever you are, stop it, okay! PNoy might be touted and thought of declare Martial Law!

Aside from GoT, he also worked as Conan in The Hobbit of prequel at LOTR film series of Peter Jackson. And now he will be part of Enca, so there will be a connection with what he is doing. Even if he can see the things like him, she knows that the Kapuso will have their own gift. "The Filipino creativity is world-Class.

That's why she accepted the project that this is because it is a Good move for him, aside from enjoyable. He was able to work in Thailand, China and India, so if he will add the Philippines to his return as an actor, he will bring the larger audience when he comes to America.

Daenerys Targaryen or Mother of Dragons of GoT the peg of the New character Amihan (Max Collins), the diverse sister of Your queen Minea (Marian Rivera). Amihan was riding a flying dragon Amihan when he was shot in the scene. It was just a guest role and Max died immediately as Amihan, that's why Minea's tribute to her second child. Beauty is the queen of Liverpool, who was able to immediately stop the bad diaries as Adhara (Sunshine Dizon). The Your queen is brought to her womb is the second child of her husband (Dingdong Dantes), the leader of soldiers of Sapiro.

The greedy Hathor will get the bride of Adamya so they will be more powerful, with the leadership of Arvak (Roi Vinzon) and Hagorn (John Arcilla). Direk Mark Reyes is in tears by Encantadia. He was emotional because after three failed attempts, last year, the remake of PET project was already given a signal signal. Direk Mark is grateful to GMA who trusted the very expensive show, which according to him, is already level up this 2016. They have worked with the original Enca that they are together now. According to the director, like that, he is not a job for him but a vocation. This cannot be done if you are not dedicated.

Direk Mark said, this is part of the Philippine Pop culture and even back then, the Enquirer is not gone, that's why she also wanted to return it for the new audience.

First is because the benefits of some service, even in food, medicine and other Eclipse of the elderly are 60 years old. But do you know the story that is given to our beloved senior citizens is being abused? We said that they were abused because they usually carry the grandsons and grandmother to pay for a grocery or gift.

I do not want to be good but the company is pitiful because when it comes to the day, they closed and they are selling the very big story, it will be given to the seniors who are usually used by children, grandchildren or other relatives, IDs to buy discounted donut. At the moment our fellow countrymen who lose their jobs are sacrificed because of the abuses done by some of our countrymen. That's why I hope this can be seen by some of the companies that will walk in order to correct or if not, implement a little restriction for the welfare of the future of their personnel. I want to assert that we are not against the benefits that we cannot stomach; the abuse of some of the benefits that should be just for the needs of our grandparents, mother and father. Anyway, it is very hard to help those who take advantage of the benefits for our senior citizens, it is better for the companies to act. Give to what is right, but make sure that they recognize the requested story because if there are opportunist relatives of seniors who use the preview of grandparents, grandmother, the companies who do not care about the elderly who are asking for stories when this is the law's statements.

More than SWS, Pulse Asia Mas big is the number of those who voted here compared to those answering to the sery which is being held by Pulse Asia and Social Weather Station with 1,200 "respondents" only. Whatever it means, Bro, you will take care of you. But the election in Yahoo Philippines is open to the public, while it's just a garbage that will be made out by SWS and Pulse Asia. Does it mean that the election in Yahoo Philippines is more believable than the "election" in SWS and Pulse Asia? All of you are the answers or own beliefs and we do not scope it. But what is clear, no one is talking about any mistake here. As long as the election ended, it seems like a month. With oneself, the camp of PNoy is being sent to debt. Overall, Filipinos want to stay in the asydersson of Ninoy and Cory. And this is what caused the news of the news on PNoy's second term. What will be the voice of his boss, maybe he will follow it. He said, hopefully PNoy will not replace Benigno Simeon Aquino III in his position to start 2016 until 2022 and more. Because PNoy's party does not bet in 2016 because the masses is given a chance, the masses would not bite him. If it will be bitten, "he will be bitten by truth in the election so that he will not enter Malacanang. REMATE survey Access survey has been made by our newspaper Remate regarding staying or not by PNoy in Malacanang. Our question in the past week is: Is it right to change the 1987 Constitution so that President Aquino will remain in position? If you were able to find a lot of text, Bro, you will be surprised with the reaction. Many are in favor of PNoy. But more are against PNoy... this is aside from anger towards the Constitution so PNoy can do what he wants to stay in Malacanang. In our conversation with the results, including what we cannot release because of the limitation on the time and space, around 75 percent are against PNoy while only 25% are in favor of him. If you want, there is a way to travel by PNoy in the countries in Europe in these days, what is he about the issue of term extension. Daughter of tokwa, he replied: "If you want, there is a way." And until now, he continues to consolidate his boss's voice. Who really is his boss, Bro? Many are doubting who is her boss. But many are saying something. His boss is his personnel who are ready to give him everything that will be able to pass towards his likes of ignorance. RETOKE SA Constitution is the most effective in the 1987 Constitution for the term extension. It's because the 1987 Constitution is saying that it is a way for this toke. One of the Constituent Assembly or the form of congressmen and senators as a duty to change the Constitution. It is possible that they will take it together with resentment or separate, depending on what they want because they want to ignore the meddling of the Supreme Court here. If this happened, it might not only be an extension of the change. They Are trying to make a documentary on the government's system and disarm the presidential system. "When this happened, Bro, there was no election in 2016. And PNoy will become a prime minister who is most powerful in the Philippines. Because of the excessive bribery of the lawmakers, the Prime Minister of PNoy will also be a lifetime and the term of his KKK or asungot will also be a lifetime. Hehehe. Martial law could also be included in the number of causes in my beloved Philippines from the kidnappers for ransom from the Abu Sayyaf and the New People's Army, the bombings will be repeated and blamed for all those "caused by martial law. This is easier for the term extension because the end of the gun of the military and the police will be used for staying in the power of all those who are thirsty for power. It brought her too much!

And this is even more efficient to go to tourists in China. But according to the report of the China Daily, it is more Chinese national who is threatening the neighboring country of South Korea for the similar beauty service. So, if there are a lot of tourists who go to China to make sure, more Chinese people go to South Korea for the more advanced technology of beauty collective surgery.

The children and teachers of the alternative schools of Lumad in Mindanao are dismayed that they cannot be protected by Education Secretary. Armin Luther's military attack Save Our Schools (SOS) Network, groups campaigning for the protection of schools from the military attack, which seems to have been hesitant to protect the children. According to the reports of abuse by soldiers in their communities and schools. Talking to a conversation yesterday, December 2, the SOS Network to LuMinister about the represented by the department memo which is allegedly used by the military to represent their schools. But according to Madella Santiago, tags of SOS Network, it seems that it is just the same way that agreement with LuMinister in the negotiations of the group to Assistant Secretary. Tonya Umali last week. "This is the first face of Secretary. This is after two years of negotiations with the officials of DepEd. But after a while, he said that we still need to give him the complaints of military abuse in schools in Mindanao, "Santiago said. In a conversation, LuMinister listened to the complaint of teachers and issions from the Tribal Filipino Program, alternative Learning Center for Agra tural and Livelihood Development (Alcadev), Salugpongan Tatarning Center and the Rural history of the Philippines with schools in Mindanao. They announced that the military left the schools of indigenous people in Mindanao or convince President Aquino to leave or prohibit the military to use Catholic schools. "I try to convey the issue but I do not know if I will put an end," Luther wrote in the group. He also said that the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) should answer the issue of the funded school of the rebel New People's Army the alternative schools of the Lumad by the secretary to fix the documentary on the complaints and give them a copy. He will also call for special meetings of the Inter-Agency Committee on Children in Armed Conflict (IAC-CIAC) to table and discuss the complaints. Born last year was the IAC-CIAC, by virtue of the Executive Order 138, to focus on charges of violating the rights of the children, during the time of the armed conflict. This is composed of government agencies together with the AFP and DepEd, but in the leadership of the Council for the Welfare of Children. According to LuMinister, this is the right agency to resolve the cases filed by SOS Network. "Our agreement (SOS Network), DepEd will lead and we will be a bridge to reveal all their documents and statements and we will turn it back to this (Europe) Inter-agency," he said in midfield. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The secretary also insisted that there is no need to have a new memorandum. It is said that there is only a need to add or amendment to be strict in implementing Memorandum 221. "Actually, he is not a new memo, because we have an Eclipse of 221 (because) the basis has been presented there: First, non-private, NGO, or the public to enter the guidelines," Luther said. But there is a exemption for "non-military activities" like "Brigada Eskwela" and needs to be according to the guidelines. For SOS Network, this is unlikely because part of the counter-armed program of the government is the "Brigada Eskwela" and other civilian-military operation. It seems that DepEd abandoned his responsibility to protect the children. According to the separation source of Pinoy Weekly, he does not want to mention any name, it has been given a copy of the documentary on the complaints of Thailand. In the truth, the Inter-agency gathered in October and the case of Salugpongan was included in the table. Also, there is a separate mechanism of the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) for the "six child rights violations" stated by the UN and included in the Eclipse of 221. According to the said informant, he was given a copy of the IAC-CIAC. The organizers are wondering why the response of DepEd is not taking the action and repeated response of DepEd in the cases. "It is disheartening," Secretary said. LuMinister in dialogue. After he learned to listen personally to the child and teacher, he will pass the process of the bureaucracy in resolving it, "said Gabriela Rep. Emilia de Jesus, who also sat with a conversation. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. De Jesus also said that LuMinister needs to face the matter because the security of the children and teachers are at stake in a conversation. It is said that LuMinister did not have the safety of them in his refusal to leave the military in the community. "He should show his strength as secretary of DepEd, who is for the achievements of the child. "We will hold him accountable for the department if something happens to these children," he said. The SOS Network added that although they are disappointed, they will pass it to the department the documentary about the violations of the mixar and insisted the trash of the Eclipse of 221. "We will do our part and we are expecting that it will also be done by Secretary. "His commitment and not to pass it to other government agencies is the resolution of the problem that we put on him," Santiago said. The SOS Network of Manila, the campaign of Lumad and human rights groups in Mindanao to bring in Manila is the issue of widespread violation of human rights in Mindanao.

He is the sibling of Eulogio "Eli" Castillo, one of Morong 43 who is still detained in Mamburao Provincial Jail despite the release of his other companions.

The killing happened while a Peace Pilot launched last December 13-15, 2011 in two provinces of Mindoro who attended by various sectors in the entire island as part of the commemoration of the International Sunday human rights. The LDGC- NPA Mindoro strongly condemned this murder. Guillermo is a picture of a simple citizen whose only intention is to live a decent from his own efforts in work to back up her family while his duty is being implemented as a farmer.

Many lives are changed and the super typhoon "Yolanda can still change." His effect is not only to the people but also in institutions - including the Armed Forces of the Philippines or Armed Forces of the Philippines and the modernization of this will probably be. It can be recalled that the leadership of the government is focused on the so-called "minimum credible defense capability" or the ability to defend our country. Even before the typhoon Pablo has arrived, "Ondoy," etc., the AFP is the main expected to snatch and save the victims. But Yolanda "is unusual" - not only because it was publicized in history as the strongest typhoon and its extensive damage that brought the Philippines on the map of the world but also because of the biggest gathering of the countries that brought help or / and equipment to assist the Philippines. That's the deprivation of the government's ability to respond to the calamity, with such an intense and expansion of damage. Although the AFP immediately respond to the first hours of the death of "Yolanda," the equipment used to be humanitarian and Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR). There is a need for more ships, airplanes and helicopter to send help not only to airports and airports but directly to barangays who are affected by it. This is the big challenge to the government. Due to the cut bridge, they hike a tree, post, and cable that passed through the roads, and destruction of communication - still lack of assistance, 10 days after. With the influx of many help and equipment from different countries and private organizations, the very big needs of the victims will be solved. This calamity is a lesson to see what our government should have, including the AFP, to answer the calamity. This means an additional funding for the Philippine Air Force trucks and helicopters; Philippine Navy sealift vessels; and 6.6 Trucks of the Philippine Army. In front of numerous threats to security and freedom of our territory in the West Philippine Sea, the government slowly buys some fighter jets, attack helicopter, multi-purpose attack craft, missile ship, and radar system to increase the external defense capability of the country. But the tension is not subsiding, the declaration of China broke his new Air Defense Identification Zone (AIDG). In China, China, all entering the zone (make the north of Taiwan; South Korea; and South-west Japan) need to introduce themselves and follow the authors. That's the East China Sea (ECS) territory, which is affected by South Korea and Japan. The launch of their airplanes and bomber were asked to launch these countries, including America, against the declared government of China and sending the latter of his aircraft carrier in ECS. In front of a new announcement on the North west of the Philippines, it is not impossible that we will be affected by the conflict. This can advise more than the desire to fulfill the "minimum credible defense capability" of the Philippines. This is in front of the feel of "Yolanda" for the equipment of AFP for HADR. That's why the funds are not pulling each other again because the 140 characters that need to be used for defending our territory and the one to hold Independence and insecurity in our limits. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Hopefully our leaders see the same needs and give priority to the strengthening of the country that cannot depend on other sectors of society. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Push for what has been delayed and it is just proper that the modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines should be implemented.

We're going to get a lot MORE. Tweet We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. There are some people who were only injured in the previous storm Gareth. In the province of Quezon that happened when there was a tornado in the town of Jomalig. Of course, there are some who understand the house but they are still thankful to the Lord for the lack of casualties from them. Let us be thankful and nobody has died while we are still being treated. Severe traffic this Saturday brought by typhoon Gareth in Manila, the traffic got tangled. It's a good Saturday and the millions of students in elementary and haul are not inflated which are usually bished by their tremendous vehicles and public. But the point here is that traffic is severe. It is good that the authorities continue studying how they will fight the severe traffic, especially the flood that is the source of it. How can the people help solve this problem? Different kinds of help May will be able to do some things to help the flood and traffic as well. First, report to the authorities the deliberately sharing holes of the drainage just to earn in a school school or so the citizens will be forced to ride a surge or tricycle. Second, is it possible for the people to arrest the tricycle drivers with the surge, tricycle and motorbike who are collecting payment for expensive fares in time of flood? Third, how will they fight the creation of a swimming pool on the flooded roads so if there will be a vehicle that will give them a dealer? Fourth, can the police and traffic enforcers can push through the middle of the road? We are saying this because if the traffic is voluted because of the flood, the police and traffic enforcers are disappearing. Fifth and for motorists, as long as we can condition is to condition our vehicles and make sure that we have enough diesel and gasoline so that we will not stop or going crazy over time of traffic and flooding. Sixth, we are pointing at each other to throw the garbage to those who should be covered and not anywhere. Remember that even small garbage like uploaded cigarettes can also return. These are just small things, Bro, but they will be double or will be able to do this to the people. The only difficult thing to do is "a pushing for the police and traffic enforcer to fix traffic because they are disappearing. New leaders but the government officials have a lot of responsibility or work in the problem of flood and traffic. Now that there are many growing management in our government, what are our expected answers to these two problems mentioned? Are they going to be the same with the rumor that they have no quarrel against traffic and flood? Hopefully, in their pledge on duty yesterday, the traffic and flooding will be included in their immediate care. The advice of the new leaders in different positions in the government are being attacked in the position and exchange of people in them. From high positions up to the police, they have been attacked and replaced. But we want a new leader to say how they will fire traffic and flood. Just how fast they were fired from the firing of the people of their opponents who are taking their position, this is also how they can solve the traffic and flood? I hope! The two problems that we mentioned are very conscious. For example, workers are tired of their job, they are tired of too much travel. It burns especially those standing in the packed buses. Do you know how hard it comes to standing passengers, especially on the parts of women, the traffic in 2, 3, 4 or 5 hours and evening or dawn when they go home? And will you also learn how to walk a kilo of kilometers in flood and holes of roads if traffic is not moving? Or you senators, congressmen, governor, mayor and other officials, speak and act quickly against traffic and flood.

Poverty, caused by the increase of crime November 12, 2014 Written by Vic Reyes Published in opinion Read: 8055 many of our countrymen who do not think but spread fear and fear in the public. They are spreading rumors through social media. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Recently, reported on social media that there are already confirmed cases of Ebola in the Philippines. Like what is expected, the gossip gave fear to many people in the country. With the number of netizens, including the child, the gossip quickly spread. It is natural to be afraid of the public, it is not unknown to everyone who is very deadly in Ebola. In fact, he killed a scarcity of 5,000 people in some countries. Most of those who died from the disease of Ebola is in West Africa. How can you not be afraid, except for the said disease, almost half of those who are suffering from the virus are glaring. The alarm, we have a lot of workers working around the world, including those in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Justice Secretary Leila de Lima said that those who have been spreading through social media can be imprisoned because of the Ebola virus. De Lima ordered the National Bureau of Investigation to find the people behind the spreading report that the Ebola virus is in the Philippines. The Department of Health (DOH) denied the said online report. The report has been viral for several days. The scheduled arrival of Filipino UN Peacekeeper contributed to the fear of the people from Liberia. The Eclipse will immediately be brought to Caballo Island for the quarantine of 21 days. After 21 days, they were only sent to their respective houses. The quarantine is aiming to ensure that the UN-eeper from Liberia has no Ebola virus. After 21 days, the Armed Forces of the Philippines will be given "Heroes" Welcome "by the Armed Forces of the Philippines over the remaining 19 months of the Aquino administration, it is better to address the attention of the cow in poverty, unemployment and non-stop increase in price of goods. Let us not forget poverty is the number one reason why the crime in the country is increasing. Many people have committed crimes because no one is feeding and buy medicine for their loved ones. Until there is the poverty and lack of work, the government will find it hard to stop the increase of crime and corruption. Because of poverty and lack of good jobs in the country, most of our countrymen are forced to find work abroad. Another painful truth is that many parents, especially in the government, are compelling their daughters, who are married or just look for a new foreigner. Sometimes, we can't blame the youth who agree with the elderly foreigner. Even if you are educated, you will find it hard to find a good job and good salary. If you find work, they are still actual. It is rare for those with work. Before the new employee completed the six months, he removes it so that he will not be permanent. We repeat, until the poverty is there, there are also various crimes. Are we right, President Aquino? Complaints and reaction: MMDA, you might have to put the footbridge here in EDSA / Munoz. In front of the chapel of Iglesia Ni Cristo. Concerned senior citizen of QC.

MATERIAL_BASE-1B_76834563 Paris attack in Philippines We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. The government and the people should not be relying on the threat of terrorism in any part of the Philippines. It might be repeated, for example, the forehead is the same bombing of buses and different parts of Metro Manila and bombing in Light Railway Transit in Blumentritt, Manila. As well as the bombing of a ship of Super Ferry 14 that the place where around 120 people died, including many students and teachers, outside Manila Bay while traveling the ship from Manila towards the Visayas and Mindanao. The bombing of the said ship was the worst made of terrorists in all countries in South East Asia, especially in the ocean. 400 + dead in record from the year 2000 to 2007 only over 400 people died. Maybe the number of those who are killed might be double if the victims of terrorism will be included in the year 2008 until now. Included among the victims who kidnapped the ransom, those who are beheaded and being shot, especially in Mindanao. If the tremendous fear of citizens and disappearance and destruction of livelihood and the future of thousands, but any million citizens, children of tokwa, terrorism is really serious. That is why, until everyone can do it, the bombing and shooting of the terrorists should not be repeated. And if you cannot stop it, a little and small are the victims of crooks. They do not choose the soul because they are being victimized and they seem to be forced to ensure that they are innocent and innocent. Do not deny the authorities, especially the military, who are not members or supporters of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, the encountered and killed in the fight in Mindanao in the past few days. Among those who were killed were two Indonesian men who could have trainers "terrorists." The flag of ISIS is allegedly being used by those who were killed to be confused by the authorities in the steps of those who were killed. However, the citizens should not just believe in the statements of the authorities in the number of failed statements of them on the matter. If it is not a failure, it is intended for a statement so that it will not alarm whoever has interest on the matter while there is a solution to the problem. It is only then that they are telling the whole truth if the journalists and citizens who know about the events are being monitored, for example in the investigation of the Congress or the reports of the United Nations. Americans, PRANSES, caution and cooperation against terrorists is really needed because of the existence of hundreds or thousands of foreign targets. The foreign active in defending their "Mother organization" in other countries, like ISIS, is located in Iraq and Syria. Americans, Pranses that killed 130 people in the Paris attack, Russell sold 240 people through the bombing of civilians in Egypt, Arab and others. An example of a referendum to the foreigners, the bombing that happened in bali, Indonesia, which killed hundreds of foreigners and not Indonesian. It ran and hid from my beloved Philippines is one of those who made a bombing in bali and nothing else but Marwan was the one who killed our Special Action Force 44 and wounded many other policemen of SAF. A crowded place to remind the authorities, be careful in crowded places. Because these kinds of places are the common target of terrorists, there are foreigners or not. Malls, churches, fiasco, bus station, train, ships and airplanes themselves. If these cannot be avoided, being observant, quick communication and strict cooperation with the authorities. Remember this: The authorities cannot take care of the fight here. They need the citizens not only in the actual struggle of tackling but also their intelligence before any attempt for terrorism, while this is happening and after the incident. It is a good example of the Paris attack that everyone is active in following the footsteps of the terrorists from Paris, France up to the countries Germany, Belgium and others that were conducted after the arrest of the police conducting the said attack.

In the data of the Alliance of concerned Teachers (ACT), national alliance between teachers in the country, with more than 1.95 million youth expected to enter the SHS and the remaining almost one million will go to private schools. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Meanwhile, the "voucher system" is being served as a "voucher system" to give assistance to the parents: A government of P16,500 pesos to P22,500 for students who will go to the private SHS. But there is no assurance that it will be accepted by everyone. According to Marquez, who is also a teacher in advised High School, "the salary of our parents, of the workers is not increasing. What happens is that the ability of the citizens to get the services will be lessened. " "If the K-12 push through, the pair of colour (will be) another privilege for our student. "Education should be the right," Marinas said. IT was on the other hand, suggesting that teachers now feel the danger brought by the implementation of reform. Teachers in elementary school were worried about the closing of their school, which was built by the SHS. The butcher Elementary School in Quezon City, for example, is set to be transferred to the nearby Jose Abad Santos Elementary School because the school will be made. "We will be an Eclipse. Instead of joining the facility, what they are doing, they will be transferred (the students) so that they will save. "The parents and teachers, even if we have complained, the principal said there was nothing to do because he decided to" go out, "one teacher said. "If they really say that there is enough funds for K-12, there is nothing. "They are looking for schools that they can buy," said one teacher from General Licerio Geronimo National High School. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. They are also complaining about the lack of Pilot testing of the program posted on the transition period of 2016 until 2020. In the transition period, the number of students in college will fall. According to the first data of the Commission on Higher Education, the more 78, 318 teachers and employees of the whole country are in danger. But the new data released on 25, 090 is very worried about the worries of critics. "We are questioning the basis of why they are not" the figures, "said ACT Teachers Representative Antonio Tinio. It is also removed from the outline of the reform of the Filipino, Literatura and Philippine Constitution in college. The Mother tongue will be used in the first set but English will be in an indoctrination after grade 3. "Our history as one of us race and a country are dismissing and will not point to our youth. "This is the same national language," says Benjamin Valbuena, teacher and national chairman of the ACT. "The students' call to dismiss the restrictions that will not respond to the needs of the Philippines, said Asis. The first time for Raymond Palatino, chairman of the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan-Metro Manila and former representative of the Chamber of Kabataan Party-list, is exposed to the pro-foreign orientation of K-12. One reason in enforcing the program is the work of those students of training and ability to get a semi-skilled job. According to Palatino, the technical vocational courses that are assigned to the needs of the strength of other countries - caregiving, copyright, housekeeping, tailoring and others. The program will also be given to the students at the age of 18, when they will work legal. "Inaccurate name is K-12, this is TESDA in high school. "Our students are given skills not to become globally competitive and to develop our own industry, but also for Manpower needs of other countries," according to Palatino. "Instead of posting it in March, we will still wait for two years. And then after grade 12, someone is waiting for a job with us. How can they say "that is now, even College graduate, unemployed. "The fall is a call center agent, or the jobs that are not suited to the course where they graduated," Marinas said. As a resolution, the aim of the drastic national alliance to tackle not only the ranks of teachers in the city, as well as in the provinces. The ACT initially passed the petition which contains their complaints about K-12. The stop K-to-12 Alliance will also lead the form of the curriculum for Basic education - according to them, will come from teachers in different parts of the country and will pass through thorough study. "We all live together, in Congress, in court, on the streets. "While there is no decision (the Supreme Court), and even if there is still a decision, we will not stop until we won't succeed," says Valbuena. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

In the invitation of our graduation day, people need to know what is happening in our industry. 'When you know him, of course, IT's one of the most busy This office because they're under secretary if he has a plan for the department of Agriculture. As of now, there is really a terrible problem of our apple grader that we are living in art, all the backyard raisers and whatever you are really weak now under the secretary so what your office is doing to not.

They are really in accordance with the policies that are presented by your office, this is what I put on it first. So that the exploitation of people will be forgotten. To the customers? The one thirty five is what we set for a thrifty person and we do not want that in the Production of me, it is up to 60 Plus. There is a deficit of 70. Because of the love of the buyer. What will be categories like before are two thirds of pesos. Oh. I went down the chick of twenty-fifty but that is still high when you think about it because he regularly takes twenty pesos. So now I am kind and all went down. But now they post now. Production? In one kilo, maybe the older brother of sixty one is probably up to one kilo. That is why our vendors are the ones who will really be affected. We should remember that he is really annoyed. There's a bet there are a lot of videos to enter. Which was the phone last few weeks. Fltt; ttt; Editing by thirty six days of my group so if they will return it in February they saw the beauty. The pipe, so many of you entered together now, we have a problem that we are going to have a program that is going to be a program that is going to go home, but it's not all that there will be a lot of supply that is going to go home but there will be a lot of supply low when there is a few supply of low prices. Other sponsored chicken says forty to fifty-five in the only amount of chicken in the farm gate price, that is why they wish that they will lower their chicken. You know that it is easy to say lower when we put it down before it will increase. Your problem is also the problem because I can easily get poor escape. Because if you have raised an example, it's because you will go to the west because we are all okay, but how come the time that the cost of Production of how will happen to the MMFF has increased. That is why I said some parts are not used for the protagonist of this person to take advantage of this day. The value to the Birit Quiapo is the best of that when I talk to them as another leader, my salary but I said to them. You should have a program not to join the bun.

They will just reconcile with them that is why we are invented by some of the chicken. I said to him that in twenty thousand twenty million to invent chicken now, if not if that is the same time, the price will come up so the best ingredients I will kill. They talk to reduce their Production by twenty five percent in the bubble, but the pork is not too affected, because we have a minimum price of one eighty five, there is a lot of dollars because it is the first not even. It is too high here in us that is why it is too much but now I am playing in the room sixty one eighty. Diane is beautiful, it means that all sectors are earning but it is obvious that until now, there are still those who have come to imported, especially those who have no preparation for this because we have found big things because we have found big reasons here because we have found a huge impact on our backyard. Just like this, I said, we have the volume of information ten percent and baton. Production of the lttt; ttt; ttt;: Ten maximum ended And then this is the parts that we say.

Number one when it comes to hail example, we cook a kilo of cook for a local time. Angel from the process The twenty percent were lessened. Ah. So, it is better for you to host it.

Tire as I am imported even the eighty. Six ltt; httt; That is why the unit is watching so cheap, you can't get the people buying imported but if you Can register the Carbon you can see, the local time is better.

Before, I said what is important to us. Let's see. There are vegetables in regulate but put a good conversation with the producer. That is why we are giving the right data to them before so that they can find out how some of the Filipinos are doing it because if we are mesmerized, you know the attitude of Filipinos, most of whom we can make sure that the weather will come too much, which is why we are going to buy so much.

Posted by: Jerry Yap on January 24, 2017 in opinion We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. There is a saying that the cunning and corrupt leaders have a saying so that a group needs to divide the rule tactics. But hopefully this is not the reason of the case filed by Manila Vice Mayor Maria Shiela "Honey" Lacfirst-Pangan against the group of majority floor leader Councilor Casey Sison together with 17 councilor of Manila. VM Honey filed a petition to stop the implementation of P14-billion city budget for 2017 after it was discovered that the budget of his office was released. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. But Judge Armando Yates of the Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 173 filed a petition for the temporary restraining order (TRO) because of lack of merit. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. According to Lacinitially there is a "unauthorized action" which is being done by some people "particularly the committee on appropriations. The budget of other departments including the Office of the Vice Mayor, City Administrator's Office and the council, should not consider the hearing, according to the vice mayor. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. That is why he was surprised when he saw his office was "out of P360 million allocated to Job orders, contractual employees, office supplies and donations. Well, that's why it turned silent "then cut off his budget! "That's a big mess"! The elderly said, do not bother the kitchen of the kitchen if you do not want trouble. One more thing, isn't VM Lacfirst-Pangan is the presiding officer of the Council! What became the reason why VM Honey felt relieved of his bribe "I mean" councilor! Is it really when it comes to the topic of money "then someone will fight each other and have a fight? It seems that we can smell the chance and early politics in the Council of Manila. Who will lead VM Honey's budget? In the majority floor leader! Who ordered to cut off? We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Anyway, hopefully the city council would realize that while they are in chaos, there are people or groups that are happy. What is the use of the city council? None. Maybe that might be the cause of their defeat in the next election because they do not do anything but fight in the treasury of Manila instead of giving service to the people. Just a request for the Council of Manila, do not be uto-uto! We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

MATERIAL_BASE-1B_17274401 For J, a new acquaintance. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. By Marjohara Tucker, I am really shallow. I do not want to receive expensive gifts, flowers or any kind of shape. I said, there are only two things that would like to laugh at me: No matter what kind of chocolate and pub - "the small white cloth that can be bought on the sidewalk. And yes, rice. It's because my friends agree to not eat rice whole week. That's why I will just wait for that after the week and finally, I have eaten rice again. They are giddy with each of them. That is what you feel when you see it. Or they're talking to. It is shallow, but happy. This is not similar to what I am feeling when I am in a rally or that is why he is talking about issues in society. Or "I Can teach workers, or talking to farmers." There is also a different kind of feeling "that is the happiness of moral, happiness that makes feelings. Maybe it is more correct that I feel giddy when I see it. "Those who want that I can stop every time we run our eyes, or I will receive a message from you. "I know that there's nothing to do with that," I'm not the same thing, but I'm really happy. You're getting tired of that. Because he is always thinking. Between the tasks, my smiling face surfaced, and I will also smile. The other day, I did not notice that I was just smiling while riding the MRT. I looked at the bad man in front of me. Why did I costly your feeling for you? The truth is, it is not yet known. Maybe because you are just happy to talk to you, and you are very open to things. If possible, we can no longer end our conversation. But it is also happy that even for a moment, it is bad. I do not know if all the excitement that you will give to me is going anywhere. I also cannot read what is in your mind. Or maybe I just don't really want to read. Because it is also scary. My friends said that I am going through five phase because I am going through something like me - discovery, happy phase, rejection, acceptance, and moving on. And IT's really happening, so maybe, I'm afraid. I am in a happy phase now, and if I am, I do not want to leave this phase. And because I do not have anything else to do but write, I will just let all my request to you. I have tried all the gimmick to express the feeling - from being a terror and sensual until he is in front of him and quickly. Now, it seems like what I want is like a gimmick, her older brother who will leave roses in the guard of Vinzons for one of the artists of Kule. Older brother who has a good smile, in case you read it and even if I read it and there is a little hope for you, it is just a celestic in front of me. Just leave KuoGuard in Vinzons. I am waiting and hope. Hopefully, there are all giddy things. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.

First, he was removed before being used as' ostracization 'wherein the people who chose to stay in Cadet Corps after being sentenced to guilty verdict was given a' cold treatment 'of all cadets. In exchange for this, many tried to make a system like 'Remination' where the offenders are given a touring punishments and allow them to join the Academy. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. For some reasons or another, they also had a problem here and that's why decided to do the separation from the Academy for the burial of the Honor Committee trial.

According to the part of the interview with Colonel Rozzano Bran, the Commandant of Cadets, in the Philippine Daily Inquirer, "The procedure agreed upon by the Honor Committee is that in a 7-2 or 8-1 vote, the committee members will go into a jury Type executive session termed chambering." We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. Col. Brit added: "It is like an additional explanation where all of them would go to the ante room and discuss what are the reasons why they voted guilty or not guilty. This has been their procedure since they started fourth-Class year until first year and everybody accepted it conscientiously. " We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. According to a junior officer who is a former member of the Honor Committee, no one was forced to return the secret ballot after the said executive session. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. "We are talking about the point that can be used in the decision in the letter of the final vote that has been standard in the decision of the Committee.

We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. 2.

But for the reason that we will turn out on January 29, the feast of San Juan Bosco in our parish, I ought to advance now our celebration of Bible Sunday. Why will Biblia is important to our Christians? What is the meaning of Biblia? There is one grandmother that reads Biblia and while he is reading her grandchild. The child was amazed at her. She came closer and asked: "Grandmother, I know what it means to Biblia!" The old man was very happy and asked: "What, that's my grandchild?" The child replied: "The meaning of the Bible is about five letters: Basic Information Before Leaving Earth! When will you leave this world? " What will Biblia? What is the right reading and understand this? Where should this be used? In the past few days, a lawmaker used the Biblia as proof that God is allowed to death penalty because his Son, Jesus, was sentenced to death penalty. Is this kind of thinking? The truth is, even in the logic (logic), I cannot see the place to stay at this kind of reasoning! In Response to boxing, This is a big margin of punches, instead of an opponent, the referee was hit! What should be considered in the reading of Biblia? "There is a" Bible Christian "who loves to use the Bible to know what the Lord wants to her especially in solving his probe. Sometimes her business was bankrupted and like his habit, he will consult the Biblia. He took it and closed the page. He was shocked when he was greeted by Matthew 27: 5 saying: "Don't go out and hanged himself!" He was scared and asked the Lord: "Lord, this is what you want to do? And he tried to look again. While his eyes were closed, he opened the Bible and his index was able to catch Lukas 10: 37 saying: "Have you got to do so," he almost passed out of fear when he opened the holy book. What greeted his conversation: Juan 13: 27, "whatever you need to do, do it immediately!" And you know that probably the next... he committed suicide! The Bible is not like a "book of prediction" which is telling Our fate. This is also not like the "Best Seller" book at the National Books store. This is not only contains history or standards in good life. The Bible is the word of God! This is the book where God expressed his love and loyalty to the people in giving us safety. In the Edinburgh we saw how Jesus was able to study the entire signings! The Bibiliya is what was intended by Jesus to us in the current season. Do I have an hour on reading the Bible? Maybe there is a "summer price" in the Bible I was able to buy or the amount of dust because I do not find her in its place! If I persevere to waste a lot of time reading the Wattad, why is it that a page of Bibiliya is not long term read? They said: If you want a way... if you do not want, there is a reason! Let us make a habit every day reading the Bible! Let us remember that in prayer, we talk to God. In reading the Bible... He is talking to us. When did you let him talk to him? But it is not just enough to read Bibiliya. It is more important to reading is the word of God's words and gender. There are christians who are fabricated because they can just mention from memory of their capitalists and berries. The question... are they living with them? Even if it is your head from the first page until the end but you did not injure and expression of gender, it is just for you to "wang" who is making noise that there is no good thing to do with the safety of your soul! Read, blocking and gender! This is the way to be called the real "Bible Christians." There are three ways to make God's words in our daily lives. We're going to get a lot MORE.

It can be recalled that the government of PNoy appointed more than P400M for the reward of the arrest of the leaders of CPP-NPA-NDF.

We're going to get a lot MORE. Many are talking in my last column that I said that Senator Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos could change and straighten out the mistakes of his parents during the time of martial law. Some of our readers said that I have written the column because I did not experience blogging by the Marcos dictatorship. What should be said, Bongbong admitted to the sin of his family and asked for forgiveness to the people. I am saddened by these comments because it is clear for me that this is a kind of closing mind. First, the big part of the Filipino people experienced blogging during the time of dictatorship and we are together in this part. But I did not close my mind to identify a leader with a good enough to change our society even if he is. This is a matter of progress in the country and not my personal feelings or experience. The sin of his father or mother should not be given to the child. I have an opinion that they will say that they will get rid of their parents because of the mistakes made.

MATERIAL_BASE-1B_20467725 Witnesses: Hopefully, hopefully... By Jimmy Canton August 13, 2016 a good news was made by Hidilyn Diaz, who welcomed him on Thursday afternoon at the airport in his arrival from Rio de Janeiro. Everyone thought that he will finish his joining the international competition after the silver medal last Sunday. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. But he said, he is ready to continue his career and join the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. But before that, he will enjoy the P5 million reward and a house is a lot. He plans to buy a vacant lot beside their house in Zamboanga and will let the youth in their area will be tested, which will be tested that brought him to success. P5 million for his plan is lacking, but surely there are good people who will help to push through what he wants to happen. Hopefully Diaz is not fed up in his difficult training so that he will join the Tokyo four years from now. I remember what happened in 1996 when Only Velasco was home with a silver medal from the Atlanta Olympics. She invited showbiz and because of her intelligence in comedy, she was given a Break. The thing is, Only does not return to boxing. The dynamics in showbiz liked to be far from the trend in boxing where he needs to wake up early to jog and training, where he needs to maintain his weight, where he needs to sacrifice every day. Not long after, Only forget boxing and chose a colorful life in showbiz. Sometimes, he got tired of boxing. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. IT was a shame, because that was just 21 years old and I hope IT was ripe for him to join the 2000 Sydney Olympics. I hope that this is not what happens to Diaz, that would surely be the Athlete of the Year of the Philippine Sportswriters Association. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE. We're going to get a lot MORE.
