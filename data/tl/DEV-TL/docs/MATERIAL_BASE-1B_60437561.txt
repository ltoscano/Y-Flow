By Elech Dawa June 10, 2016
Tinapik si Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano bilang honorary chairman sa pag-organisa ng Philippine Superliga (PSL) ng FIVB World Women’s Club Championship sa Oktubre 18 hanggang 23.
Sa meeting nina PSL chairman Philip Ella Juico at PSL president Ramon ‘Tats’ Suzara noong Miyerkules, all-out support si Cayetano matapos tanggapin ang posisyon na ibinigay sa kanya.
Ayon kay Cayetano, hihilingin nito kay incoming President Rodrigo Duterte na mag-isyu ng executive order para pakilusin ang vital government agencies tulad ng Philippine Sports Commission (PSC), Department of Tourism, Department of Health, Philippine National Police, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority at Bureau of Immigration habang dinadaos ang week-long volleyball festival. Dagdag pa ni Cayetano, ire-request nito sa President-elect Duterte na maging guest of honor at personal na i-welcome ang mga players, coaches at officials ng club teams na Brazil, Thailand at Italy.
“This is such a prestigious event. The world will be watching as we open our doors to eight of the world’s best club teams,” pahayag ni Cayetano. “Rest assured that the government will throw its full support behind this exciting endeavor.”
Sakto ang pagkakalagay ni Cayetano sa board dahil malaking boost ito sa local organizing body ayon kay Juico.
“At least we’re now assured of government guarantee,” sabi ni Juico, former PSC chairman at presidente ng Philippine Amateur Track and Field Association.

“With the honorable Senator on board, we can now smoothly run this world-class tournament knowing that the government is behind us. This is major boost in raising the profile of volleyball in the country.”
Kinumpirma ni Suzara ang pagdating ni International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) president Ary Graca kasama ang ibang key officials ng world-governing volleyball body. “He told me that he wants to meet our newly-elected President,” ani Suzara, na miyembro rin ng Asian Volleyball Confederation at ng FIVB. “We had a meeting in Japan two weeks ago and he was very eager to go here to serve as guest of honor and meet our President.”
Walo sa mga best club teams sa buong mundo ang lalahok sa nasabing tournament.
