Rose pinamigay ng Bulls
June 24, 2016
Pinamigay ang binabagabag ng ilang taon nang may tama sa tuhod na si Chicago Bulls playmaker at former NBA Most Valuable Player Derrick Rose sa New York Knicks kahapon (Manila time) via six-player deal.
Inaasahan ang ilang paggalaw sa team sa bisperas ng NBA Rookie Draft lalo’t naghahagilap talaga nang makakatulong ang Knicks makaraang sumablay sa 70th NBA 2015-16 season playoffs.
Padpad bukod kay Rose si fellow guard Justin Holiday at ang second-round 2017 NBA Draft pick sa New York buhat sa Bulls kapalit nina center Robin Lopez at guards Jerian Grant at Jose Calderon. “Knowing Derrick as I do makes this trade a hard one,” bulalas ni Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf. “Everyone knows him as the local kid who became MVP for his hometown team, but not everyone got to know him like I did.

While he is a terrific basketball player, he is an even better person with a tremendous heart.”
Napunitan ang oft-injured na si Rose, 27, sa left anterior cruciate knee ligament noong 2012 playoffs kasunod ang tore sa meniscus sa kanyang right knee sa kaagaahan ng kampanya noong 2013-14.
May average si Rose na 16.4 points at 4.7 assists para sa Bulls last season.
“I wish him the best of health for the remainder of his career and I want to personally thank him for everything he did on the court and in the community during his time with the Chicago Bulls,” panapos ni Reinsdorf.
Balak din ng Bulls na i-trade si guard Jimmy Butler, sangkot ang Boston Celtics at Minnesota Timberwolves pero malabo na ito ngayong nagalaw na si Rose.
