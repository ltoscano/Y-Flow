[26.650]
<hes> ito po yung <hes> one week celebration po ng <hes> para po sa Armed Forces ninyo .
[33.490]
<hes> it was actually <hes> law na po which is the Republic Act number ten six six four .
[39.890]
<hes> it is an act <hes> declaring <hes> the last full week of August as the Armed Forces of the Filipino People Week .
[47.210]
so nag-start na po siya mula last Sunday until this <hes> (()) until August thirty one .
[54.126]
okay so yesterday I was able to interview Captain Frank Sayson where in he he told me about this <hes> music video entitled Hanggang Mamatay kung saan of course this is in part pa rin of the celebration of Armed Forces of the Filipino People Week Week .
[67.092]
this to actually recognize yung mga living soldiers natin yung mga living heroes na hindi na nakikilala ng generation ngayon .
[75.631]
so this is actually to create public awareness so nag-collaborate yung National Heroes Day and of course yung Armed Forces of the Philippines para ma-recognize yung mga <hes> Filipino soldiers natin .
[86.924]
yes tama ka diyan Miss Diane pero <hes> hindi lang po ang living heroes natin it is also a tribute f- -- <hes> for our past .
[94.260]
past and past heroes yung mga veterans natin and <hes> sa mga naging contributions nila sa national security nation building and <hes> social economic <hes> development for the well being of the entire country .
[109.350]

okay while <hes> we -- kasi 'no we've done our -- our mission really is to provide educational assistance sa mga sundalo -- sa mga anak ng mga sundalo nating killed in action .
[131.240]
and aside from that we really feel that it is parang it's imperative 'no on our part to also highlight yung sacrifices kung ano ang ginagawa ng mga sundalo natin ngayon .
[141.190]
and one way I mean basically this is our way of giving back and expressing our thanks and gratitude for their service and their sacrifice .
[149.715]
