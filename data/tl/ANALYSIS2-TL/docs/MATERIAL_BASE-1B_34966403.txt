ating lahat .
[0.719]
ayan oo well you consider as a first female pilots 'no .
[5.190]
ah talaga nga naman ano .
[6.728]
eh papaano po (()) %incomplete
[7.856]
ano ba yung motivating factor bakit -- bakit baba %incomplete
[10.919]
hindi naman po kayo sa -- sa attack helicopter ?
[13.870]
ah no .
[14.634]
after our graduation we're both assigned sa Philippine Air Force Flying School as Instructor Pilots .
[21.049]
yeah .
[22.640]
so ma'am kasama ba kayo magpapalipad doon sa mga <foreign> 'di naman ?
[26.490]
hindi naman actually I am designated as a parader ngayon pero alternate parader ako .
[31.309]
dito lang kami sa baba .
[32.293]
okay so wa- -- what it feels like pag nagpapalipad ka ng mga -- ng mga gano'n may mga formation ?
[39.118]
may -- may (()) sinasabi si Colonel Musiko kanina sixty nine formation of the trainer <hes> aircraft papaano it gagawin ?
[49.250]
(()) actually <hes> there are detailed <hes> pala -- fly by pilots and they trained -- they were trained to do that .
[58.560]
and <hes> Colonel Hernale can expound on that more .
[62.230]
dahil sa unit niya galing yung ano yung mga magpapalipad na 'yon .
[65.629]
oh Colonel Hernale ikaw daw .
[67.097]
papaano -- papaano natin buo -- may mga fear eh di ba ?
[70.596]
paano baka magka- -- sabit-sabit paano ?
[72.678]
well it's a ano na nga 'yan resulta ng magandang training ng ating mga piloto .
[79.443]
so before this activity before <hes> this activity they were trained and <hes> they have practiced for several <hes> a couple of days and <hes> ito yung mga seasoned pilots na magpapalipad .
[93.956]
they are the mentors of their education and training command .
[97.190]
teka ma'am sabi n'yo couple of days lang ?
[99.349]
tama ba 'yon at least months man lang ?
[101.710]
<no-speech>
[102.420]
<hes> hindi naman inabot ng gano'n katagal .
[105.107]
siguro kung sabihin natin mga two weeks ang practice ng piloto natin .
[109.090]
okay ma'am where'd you experience that before ?
[111.132]
yeah yes when we were instructor pilots at the flying school we used to fly <hes> formation and flyby during <hes> activities like these .
[122.330]
okay ma'am <hes> sa ating -- sa inyong dalawa ano ba ang dapat gawin para maging <hes> successful female pilot ka katulad mo ma'am ?
[131.330]
well I guess ang kailangan lang is determination and <hes> you really have to show your -- your <hes> your -- your -- your <hes> <no-speech> <hes> will .
[146.245]
will -- your will para gawain 'yan .
[148.900]
it's -- it's really just like before hindi ito open sa mga babae .
[155.564]
it was only during our time when Hit was offered to female like us so <hes> yung aming pinagdaanan ni Colonel Hernale is <int> something na talagang <hes> -- talagang parang kasi novelty kami eh .
[172.835]
so when we started all eyes are on us .
[176.379]
but -- but -- but we were able to hurdle that at 'yon nga parehas na kaming colonel .
[182.050]
Colonel Hernale <hes> mayroon na ba kayong nasubukan na na piloto na talagang matatakutin pero gusto talaga niya maging pilot eh .
[188.686]
how did they overcome that at pa- -- papaano ano yung motivation ninyo para sa kanila ?
[194.060]
<hes> yeah I have encountered the mga ilang estudyante din na makikita mo na may fear sila but siguro kung yung ano ng ano %incomplete
[203.336]
<hes> actually the motivation of the instructor pilot to do that ay malaking ano malaking bagay .
[208.457]
actually <hes> I was an instructor pilot for several years until now .
[212.550]
so ang ginagawa ko lang siguro you have to know the person .
[216.928]
even the family na pinanggalingan niya dapat malaman mo kung papaano siya pinalaki .
[222.074]
and then kasi as an instructor pilot you should have -- you should also be parang psychologist ka na pag-aaralan mo yung behavior ng isang tao so 'yon ang pinakamalaking <hes> papel siguro na ginagampanan ng isang instructor pilot .
[237.329]
may mga fear ba na no'ng naging female pilots po kayo eh hindi ba dumating sa point na tipong baka ma-assign kayo sa mga war torn areas mga gano'ng bagay ?
[250.070]
actually <hes> <no-speech> 'yan yung isang bagay na na hinangad din namin na maranasan noong araw kaya lang <hes> after our graduation we were <hes> we were designated at the Air Education and Training Command .
[266.126]
but after that <hes> -- after my stint as instructor pilot I was assigned as a transfer pilot and I flew the the -- the Fokker the -- the F Twenty Seven .
[277.645]
yeah that was the last plane that I -- <sta> that I flew .
[281.485]
naku ma'am ako naman <hes> after a while sa Air Education and Training Command I was assigned with the headquarters sa Philippine Air Force and the short period sa Presidential Air Lift Wing and I am back again sa <breath> <hes> <int> Air Education and Training (()) Command .
[299.436]
but before that I was the -- assigned as the <hes> group commander ng isang tactical operations group sa Lucena City .
[307.635]
'yon maraming-maraming salamat .
[309.575]
