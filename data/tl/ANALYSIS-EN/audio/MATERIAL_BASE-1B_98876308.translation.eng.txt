who would think that in this cold place in Baguio ice cream is also popular .
but not just simple ice cream because it is accompanied by nachos partnered with favorite souvenirs from Baguio like strawberry peanut brittle and with bonus blueberries .
look I already posted it in Instagram .
insta-hit .
it is an ice cream sundae that is called dessert nachos because they have gimmicks like this .
because usually right for nachos the first thing that pops it's chili salsa .
so for a twist let's make it something sweet .
which is why we thought why not with vanilla ice cream and the fruits available here in Baguio .
yes .
it has caramel sauce right ?
yeah with caramel .
how tasty .
the nachos it's deep fried .
was able to meet .
thank you .
the strawberry and blueberry is rightly mixed .
and then the two sauces I don't -- I thought it was caramel only but it also has blueberry sauce in it .
what do you use for your chips ?
the chips is homemade .
yummy .
yummy .
the chips and the extra text -- texture that's what makes it good .
the one that has texture .
every time we go to Baguio we probably don't think of looking for ice cream .
but I promise that this sundae I've tasted is one of the best .
