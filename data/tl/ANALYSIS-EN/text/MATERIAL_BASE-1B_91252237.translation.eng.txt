you're extraordinary.
express your uniqueness and talents; and if you are able to do this, you have trust in yourself that you are extraordinary and really different.
be honest to yourself and most importantly, believe only the truth.
not raw or not short.
not inadequate and also not in excess
no dirt, speck, or even a tiny mark.
but only which is pure and perfectly true
because this is where it mirrors who you are and the character you possess.
here is your integrity and well-cared-for reputation.
if this is not within you, you are part of those who have gone astray and a burden to the society you are a part of.
instead of a solution, you even add to the problem.
if you want to have an exemplary character, it is important for you to find out and heed the tiny voice that constantly commands you.
here is your primary critic; critical, faultfinder and reproachful.
it is packed with conflicting opinions, and if you are indifferent and conforming to any idea that it represents, you don't have control or any suppression on the outcome.
it is too late even if you regret it.
each of us has the power to choose.
and choose right over wrong.
however, we rarely use it.
every time we are in danger and hopeless, that is only where we fumble to decide.
when we actually have enough time to prepare and avoid any imminent danger.
often times, what makes it difficult to do the right thing is the stubbornness of pride.
insisting even if it's wrong just to prove that you have word of honor and stand.
this is useless and hollow hypocrisy, even if the heart shouts for humility and acceptance of wrongdoing
we all make mistakes, that is why a pencil was created with an eraser.
best of all, accept the mistake so it can be rectified.
for as long as it is hidden and covered up, the sin only intensifies.
because we don't want to be criticized, we become blind to the opportunities in front of us.
our self-esteem weakens and we lose faith to go on.
