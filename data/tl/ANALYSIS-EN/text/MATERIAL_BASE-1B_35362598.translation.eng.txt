DSWD blames the LGUs in slow Bicol relief by Jun Tadios January 5, 2017 the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) has blamed the local government units (LGUs) in the delay experienced in the sending of relief goods to the places devastated by typhoon Nina particularly in Bicol.
nevertheless, Secretary Judy Taguiwalo clarified that the government is not neglecting the sending of relief goods to the places devastated by typhoon Nina.
DSWD was alert in taking action in the places hit by the typhoon last Christmas and guarantees that each need of the victims of the typhoon is given in accordance to the mandate or covered by the aide that their department can give.
there might be incidents that the arrival of former relief goods is slow, this is already in the level of the local government because they are mandated to distribute to the affected barangay or place.
this is a reaction of the DSWD in the statement of Vice President Leni Robredo on the slow arrival of aide to the victims of typhoons in Camarines Sue which is the hometown of the vice-president.
"even before Nina has taken a landfall in the affected areas, the DSWD has prepositioned the food packs in addition to the respective food packs of the LGUs because they have each their own calamity funds. so, the DSWD should not be blamed in this kind of incident because we are pro-active and always ready to help our countrymen who are celebrating Christmas while there is a typhoon," the secretary said.
nevertheless, the DSWD asks for an apology if there are said delays in the distribution of food packs from the national government.
"this is a challenge to us. this kind of incident actually is present, so, we should not allow this to happen. we are here to help our fellow countrymen and our mandate to serve them is our top priority," asserted by Taguiwalo.
