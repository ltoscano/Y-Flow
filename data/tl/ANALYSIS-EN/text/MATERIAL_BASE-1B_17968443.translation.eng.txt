not leaving the Philippines just yet is Miss Universe 1993, Dayanara Torres, one of the judges in Miss Universe, even though the pageant is over because she still has a lot of Pinoy artists to meet up with who she worked with during the span of her career.
Yari (nickname of Dayanara) wants to meet with Cesar Montano, Aga Muhlach, Pops Fernandez, the group Manouevres, Ariel Rivera, and Martin Nievera.
Yari worked with Pops, Martin, Ariel, and Manoeuvres in ASAP.
on the other hand, Dayanara remains beautiful and while I was looking at her recent photos, she has similarities with one Brazilian model who became an artist in Manila, Daiana Meneses.
for sure, flattered and excited are those who previously worked with Dayanara in ASAP to meet and talk to her.
Dayanara and Aga got together in the movie, Basta's Kasama Kita and Type Kita Walang Kokontra with Cesar.
