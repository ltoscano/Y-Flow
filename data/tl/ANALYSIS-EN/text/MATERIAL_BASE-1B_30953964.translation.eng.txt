Jana, already happy with Ejay by Allan Diones
November 2, 2016
like Aljur Abrenica and Kylie Padilla, Kapamilya hunk Ejay Falcon and former Kapuso star Jana Roxas were also spotted in Japan last All Saint's Day.
turns out Jana Roxas is the Jana Prince Stefan was saying in the podcast interview of Mo Twister that was his friend whose current boyfriend is Ejay.
Jana is Prince's friend whom he shared with how he really likes the machismo of Ejay, that next time they went to the gym Jana was already with Ejay and the two were already dating.
Jana also gossiped to Ejay that he was the type of Prince so Ejay teased gay Prince whenever they saw each other in the gym.
Jana is the product of StarStruck batch 3, the same batch as Jackie Rice.
Prince is also from StarStruck (batch 4, together with Aljur) so the two are friends.
before Ejay and Jana went to Japan we saw a photo taken when the former members of StarStruck had dinner and joining the group pic was Ejay, because he is dating Jana now.
our latest news about mestiza Jana is she is dating a non-showbiz guy with many tattoos, and we knew they were dating for a long time and were already planning to get married.
obviously the said guy is absent, whom Jana was in love with and crazy about for a long time.
26-year-old Jana is fabulous because her current boyfriend is Ejay.
the last linked to Ejay is Ellen Adarna, which seemed to have ended up nowhere.
we are not sure if Jana who was absent from the scene for a long time plans to return to showbiz or is happy to be dating Ejay Falcon, whom her gay friend Prince desired.
