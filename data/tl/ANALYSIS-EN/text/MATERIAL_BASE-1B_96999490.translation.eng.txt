August 18, 2016
Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) collaborated with former President and current Manila Mayor, Joseph Estrada, for a project to promote sports and distance youth from drugs.
"we had a wonderful meeting with former President Joseph Estrada, and he wants us to plan a sports project for the youth of Tondo," said PSC chairman, Butch Ramirez.
"he (Estrada) is really bent and very serious on promoting sports to the youth to keep the children away from drugs."
Erap proposed to organize a comprehensive sports program in Manila, which will be the anti-drug campaign for the youth of Tondo.
"sports is for the human development of everybody, and one of the effective ways of shying away the youth from the menace of drugs and other vices," Ramirez added.
this is only one of the programs Ramirez plans to impart to the Local Government Units of the country.
"we want to partner with the Department of Interior and Local Government, and all the LGUs under the agency for the nationwide implementation of a genuine grassroots sport development program, where our kids and youth will have the chance to equally participate," Ramirez finished.
San Juan City hints to be the first LGU in the anti-drug program with more than 400 admitted drug dependents to join the Zumba of PSC Fun and Games in Parke, PLAY 'N LEARN in Pinaglabanan Shrine.
