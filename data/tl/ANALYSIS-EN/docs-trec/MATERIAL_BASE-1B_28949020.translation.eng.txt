respect January 22, 2017 the issue on the plan of the Department of Health (DOH) to distribute condoms in schools particularly to those in fourth year high school continues to heat up.
in fact, DOH secretary Paulyn Jean Ubial was not the only one attacked in this action but also some lawmakers who oppose the DOH's planned distribution of condom in schools have been threatened.
squabbles on this issue that get ignited further on social media due to exchange of opinions or beliefs on the planned action by the DOH cannot be avoided.
our appeal to the two arguing sides of the planned DOH program is to let respect prevail.
let us respect the opinion of each other because we have our own opinions on this issue.
because we have our own opinions, it is very important that we respect and recognize each one, because we believe there is no right or wrong on this issue.
it's just that when deciding on this issue seen by the DOH as a solution to resolve the problem of the ballooning number of cases of HIV, AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases it is important the decision of the majority will be recognized or considered.
we wish for the DOH's success in their goal to prevent the spread of the said types of diseases but hopefully they will learn to recognize the view of the majority and use that as their basis for implementing the programs so they will not be criticized as part of abiding by the democracy we possess.
