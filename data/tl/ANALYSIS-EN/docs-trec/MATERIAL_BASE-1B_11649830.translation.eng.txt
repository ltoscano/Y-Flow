love and other tragedies
verse 7
do not believe everything
that comes out of my mouth.
because on nights like this,
worry fumbles
and the tongue hesitates
in looking for words
to perch on your ear.
a laugh can be a whisper,
and silence can be
restless screaming.
words can also balance:
how you will answer,
how you will shoot up
consecutive letters
without certainty,
especially when the evening is as deep
as doubt.
I will assure only one thing
to you and your friends,
that if you will swat your hand that is blocking,
there may be a palm waiting
that is hiding and embarrassed to let go,
hoping that your closed fist
will open up like an honest request,
and dreaming to hold on.
-Mykel Andrada
grammar of tragedy
-inappropriate metaphor, wrong
translation of two different languages, last
syllable of a verse forced to rhyme, old
poem erased by time, never
no longer readable.
I tried to fit in
your meaning at the end of the sentence,
in the narrow space after the period,
in the hesitating curve of the mark
for questions, in the cursed line
of the exclamation point.
I will place the
dissonant letters of your name
in my title, embellished
with adjectives and adverbs, glimpsed
by shadows with their own universe
of grammar connecting our
two disconnected clauses,
poem erased by time, last syllable
of verses without rhyme, wrong
translation of different languages, metaphor
not appropriate: you.

refugee
it is difficult to find oneself
in the middle of a dark forest.
how can we leave
everything in order to be safe?
just a while ago I was being chased
by the barks of dogs and the eye of a flashlight.
before that, I quickly traversed
without looking back the bridge
separating our enemy nations,
past the stray tents on the road,
the idlers drinking by the store,
the deep snores at midnight
and the weak melody of foreign songs
carried by the smoke from the fire of early-
morning sweeps of the elderly.
and now, I am in front of the door
of your city to take shelter.
I turned my back on my shadow,
disowned my old surname,
condemned the worshipped
ancient idols, separated
from the light worshiped,
together with the memories of old secrets,
old letters and burned documents.
I surrender to you my history
and the legends of my origin.
allow my new
nationality to be your name.
-Carlos M. Piocos III
assumption
you know, I received a lot of teasing
from the rose that you sent
but I told them
this is rare so for sure, I will keep it.
I placed the flower on top of my desk
so that I see it when waking up and falling asleep
I also fight melancholy every day, you know
but like what I always say
enough for me are the stories and dreams
that we share
every time we have an encounter
even if separated for activities
let us be confident in ourselves.
the flower was already dry when I talked to you again
deep inside I thought, here you are again
you miss me, maybe we won't see each other anymore
I am worried too, you know
especially it isn't red roses
our relationship
there are times of doubt and danger
in those ones separated like us
they consider thorn and enemy.
I am trying to be strong now
but when I am alone
together with the rose that you gave
my tears fall too, you know
while reminiscing their latest report
in your last message that someone is following you
up to now
I still don't know if we will see each other again
or if they will show you again.
I assumed, this is easy
in our actions from morning until night
news of victims of state violence come
but it is different it seems, it is still different
when a beloved is taken
a companion and partner is missing.
but I try to be strong, certainly
if we see each other again or not
I will remain here
where we started
dreaming and loving
because if they think we will stop
we will be silent
in searching for you
for justice
that is what they assume.
-Maria Cristina Guevarra
embrace
and the soles of my feet are freezing
but my palms are damp.
are they confused by the new climate
and hour, and time, and the switching
of light with always a hint
of dark and chill in the afternoon?
many falling leaves
on the streets properly mortared
and the houses, almost similar
even if you know that the residents are different,
different races, different tastes in food,
different dreams and languages disturbing
and mine, my tongue is always waiting
to exclaim, mention and say without pretense
words like inin, or rice that is
scalding to the tongue, forehead sweat sticky and hot and humid
the salt of sweat, the sea inviting us to a
wade through the warm water and sad
skin of the sea, of the air, like the blow
of wind rising to distant regions that I know
is the sky, and most of all, the touch of lips at night
left by a lover and love when darkness is approaching
from the east.
it is almost nighttime, beautiful are the falling
and growing plants, flowers, buds, and the paths I walk through
when coming home, in running to sweat or passing through to go along
someone's own garden, finding the gentlemen,
the blink of waves, the wit of beauty, the city and the city of hard work
and the disgust of the unexplainable feeling of disorder,
of crowding, competition, insults, and smell of newly laundered clothes
in the nauseating city of people, in that world
where the setting rust-colored sun always has a smile
or travelers of every journey and passengers at all times need to be careful.
but now, while waiting for the next poem
and play in ordinary time, while longing for
the only true friend I will let sweat
my palms and soles of the feet while it is chilly
and reminiscing a type of

fourteen boys
1 here's to the boy who
waltzed my way out of a dark, empty street
and who drew me maps and taught me
geography (this city is our city, this river is
our sadness, and this restaurant is where you
taught me how to recognize the language of
every pulse of a heartbeat)
2 here's to the boy who
lectured me on an introductory course to
first loves, and him who is the sole flame to
a harvest of dead branches, keeping me
warm at the dead of night-the time I think
of him, and his small eyes and his sunset touch
and his hurricane breath and his ugly enunciation
of the words goodbye, farewell.
3 here's to the boy who
played me guitar songs through his silence,
us naked on his bed,
more naked on mine.
4 here's to the boy who
wrote instead of talked, and whose eyes
were signal fires telling me how lost he felt,
alone on an island while I am
a thousand miles above him,
seeing him as a tiny dirt-pixel,
but loving him all the same.
5 here's to the boy who
slept with me on the cold, tiled
floor somewhere at a province
he's always loved, while he whispered
me stories that reminded me of
my own childhood, and whose
closeness was like a run-on
sentence never perfected.
6 here's to the boy who
I wished
I have
never met.
7 here's to the boy who
I fell in love with inside the confines
of a movie theater, keeping me close
to spaces in which light was absent,
as if I were his least favorite secret.
8 here's to the boy who
held my hand against the backdrop
of a bookshelf, whose palms felt like
the pages of a badly-written novel.
9 here's to the boy who
smoked with me behind a dingy
shopping center, early evening,
as our lips tasted of apologies
and as the cold air felt like
a blanket that was ready to
separate us at once.
10 here's to the boy who
knew how to touch me like
his fingertips were lit like a birthday
candle, and whose smile
was like a big occasion
worth celebrating.
11 here's to the boy who
was like a Ciudad song-
"my emptiness".
12 here's to the boy who
had pictures of himself scattered
on the walls of his room
and also on the corners
of my memory and on the
closed gaps of my heart.
13 here's to the boy who
distanced himself far enough
for me to miss him
until the day that I die.
14 here's to the boy who
made me carve our initials
on wet cement, as if our
love was made of stone.
