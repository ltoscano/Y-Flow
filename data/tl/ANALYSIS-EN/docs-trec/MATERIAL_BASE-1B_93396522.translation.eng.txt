City of Antipolo, Rizal, November 19 - almost 50 swine backyard raisers are given a free Swine Production Seminar by the City Government of Antipolo in Sitio Boso-Boso, Barangay San Jose last October 20, 2016.
managed by the City Veterinary Office, the said program is in partnership with Excel Feeds Company and Metro Drug Company that has an objective to teach those who are in swine business with additional knowledge for their business to be successful.
livestock farming is one of the primary livelihoods of the residents of Sitio Boso-Boso.
according to Antipolo City Mayor Jun Ynares, the local government wants to help the citizens who are in farm business through the implementation of seminars where they can learn knowledge of a more effective production of livestock.
taught to the swine backyard raisers are the new technologies in swine farming from making the piglets suck the milk to the raising and propagation of these.
