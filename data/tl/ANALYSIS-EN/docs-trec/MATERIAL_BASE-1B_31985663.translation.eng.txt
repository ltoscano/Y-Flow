Davao is being attacked by dengue mosquitoes by Al Jacinto, Malou Cablinda August 3, 2016 Zamboanga City -- Davao City major Sarah Duterte-Carpio is supposedly alarmed by the increase in the number of dengue cases there after it hit more than 4,000 cases since January.
the number of casualties have also reached 25 so she is hammering the City Health Office (CHO) to find a way to stop the increase of dengue cases in Davao.
the mayor supposedly also warned yesterday that she will not release the Christmas bonus of some employees of the CHO if the number of dengue cases will continue to balloon.
Carpio's attention is focused on the Tropical Diseases Unit of the CHO who is responsible for controlling dengue.
earlier she warned that she will fire some CHO employees if they do nothing about dengue spreading to different barangays.
