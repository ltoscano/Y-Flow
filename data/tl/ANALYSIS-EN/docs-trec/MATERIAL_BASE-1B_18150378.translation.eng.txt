Puerto Princesa, Palawan, May 9 (PIA) - the Commission on Elections in Palawan is confident that election on this day will end properly despite reports that some vote counting machines (VCM) had mechanical trouble at the start of election.
according to Provincial Election Supervisor Attorney Percival Mendoza, the back-up VCM in Palawan is enough in case the said machines have mechanical trouble.
Smartmatic technicians are also on standby in clustered precincts to give technical assistance to the Board of Election inspector.
also yesterday a secured digital or SD card for the VCM in precinct number 23 in Barangay Ipilan in the town of Brooke's Point arrived.
the COMELEC discovered that the VCM did not come with an SD card when they did a final testing of the sealing recently.
meanwhile, before six o'clock in the morning the line of voters in different voting places in the city of Puerto Princesa has started to grow.
also noticeable is the presence of the police and members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines here.
senior citizens and the pregnant were given priority to vote first.
Palawan has a total of 433 barangays, 583,057 registered voters and 514 voting centers. (OCJ/PIA4B-Palawan)
