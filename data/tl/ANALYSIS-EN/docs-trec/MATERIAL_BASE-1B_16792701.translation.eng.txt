because the classrooms that can be used will decrease time for studying will decrease .
there is a shortage of classroom and what I caught up with is the grades one two and three had three shifts of classes where our students are short of two hours every day .
<no-speech>
teachers did all sorts of solutions .
okay very good .
okay arms -- the classroom was divided for two classes .
<no-speech>
ah that somehow there is a problem with noise .
and that is what the teachers complain the noise from the other side can be heard too on the other side .
<no-speech>
they also erected four tents for the students in grade one .
some have classes on stage .
the home economics room conference room and computer laboratory were also made into classrooms .
there is an effect .
regretful because you cannot do the regular activities that we do everyday .
there is also just one gate that can be used so entry and exit of the students is a challenge .
<no-speech>
whose bag is this ?
the quality of education is affected .

it was on July twenty fifteen when the public works of Manila visited the building based on their inspection the foundation of the lot where it was built on was weak .
this is also the belief of one expert in a separate inspection that was done .
say for example this part of the building would settle .
you would notice that if it leans sideways there would be an inclination when -- the building or building becomes clear and it could possibly continue .
if it continues the worst case is this building might collapse .
<no-speech>
which is why it is better not to use the building in the meantime .
<no-speech>
according to Engineer Allan Deboso one of the organizers in constructing the building in twenty ten there is no problem with the project .
(()) temporary (()) him .
you also have a supply of (()) Styro only cement plasters and some of those are (()) cement which is not part of the building's structural trading .
which is why in our opinion it is structurally stable except for the middle of the two buildings that needs to be fixed .
in that place ?
<no-speech>
yes .
since it is allegedly possible that the project was not overseen properly .
<no-speech>
the cost of fixing the building would allegedly reach thirty million pesos .
what happened before was that it was already done for the Leaning Tower of Pisa .
they hinted that they injected soil into the part that was sinking or like it's a stabilizing agent but it's apparently continuous .

this April former Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim was pressed with charges by the ombudsman regarding the defective building at Rosauro Almario Elementary School .
among those who were pressed with charges are former city engineer Armando Andres former project inspector Allan Deboso and the former owner of New C_C Barcelona Construction Corporation who is Carlos C Barcelona .
according to the complaint there was a connivance among city hall officials so that the contract can be given to New C_C Barcelona .
we tried to get the view of former Manila mayor Alfredo Lim but he declined to give a statement .
supposedly the construction of the building was rushed too .
January twenty-nine twenty ten was when New C_C Barcelona was given the notice to proceed with the project .
three months after this the project was completed .
it's a shame that the building was erected for a very good cause to respond to the shortage of classrooms but after three years or more than three years of use it quickly %incomplete
