August 15, 2016
Zamboanga City - a police official heading an anti-drug operation is dead after getting shot by two armed men while on his way back to his home in Tacurong City in Sultan Kudarat province in Mindanao.
according to the police, 46-year-old Senior Inspector Orlando Guira immediately died due to bullet wounds in his body after he was attacked by suspected hired killers who quickly escaped aboard their motorcycle this Saturday evening.
the wife of Guira luckily escaped death when she just rode a tricycle on her way home and if not she surely would have been involved.
confiscated from the area are bullet cases from a .45 caliber pistol.
it was discovered that Guira was a member of an anti-drug special task force in Cotabato City, but still not known is whether the death of the official is an act of revenge by drug lords.
police investigation on the incident continues.
President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the police and military, and other law enforcement agencies to strengthen their campaign against drugs.
the police have killed hundreds of small-time drug pushers and users in the whole country since Duterte sat as president, while big-time drug lords caught by the authorities are alive.
