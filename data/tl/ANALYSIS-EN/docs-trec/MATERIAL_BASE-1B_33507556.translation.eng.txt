according to him, the adjustment to a lifestyle there has become easier for him when he has become a member of the various organizations there, included here is a church group where he is one of the organizers of the mass which uses a Filipino language.
that was the start for him to feel the desire to build and compose an organization aspiring to support and guide our fellowmen who are needing help and support.
