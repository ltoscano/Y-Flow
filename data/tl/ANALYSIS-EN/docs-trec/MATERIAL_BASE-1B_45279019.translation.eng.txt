the image of Saint Mary that is claimed to be tearing up is the headline of local news papers here at Macrohan in Southern Leyte .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
since this news circulated just as expected the devotees and curious swarmed all over the parish of Baranggay Ichon where the crying Saint is .
<no-speech>
Mary mother of God pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death .
(()) in grace (()) the talked about icon is the Mary Mediatrix of All Grace .
this is inside the Orna or glass case .
with a height of seven feet and made of fiber glass .
on the right cheek of the Virgin you can see the mark of liquid that is assumed by many to be the tear of the Virgin .
you can see what seems like dried drops of tears .
I believed that it was a miracle because I felt inside of me that she was indeed crying .
I became happy I became sad .
I can't say .
(()) me .
<no-speech>
some of those who came wiped their handkerchiefs on the case .
some were even taking selfies .
<no-speech>
to show the said tear of the Virgin they lighted up the face with a flashlight .
<no-speech>
but many of those who came are hoping to be blessed if there is any with miracles brought by the Virgin .
like the couple grandma Anunciacion and grandpa Porferio who bore hours of travel from Cebu in the hopes of having the crying Virgin treat the acute arthritis of Nanay Anunciacion .
(()) .
(()) .
(()) .
grandpa Porferio wiped his handkerchief on the glass of the icon and wiped it on the calf of his wife .

<no-speech>
seven year old Mila not her true name shared that she offered flowers at around four in the afternoon last May three when she saw the Virgin tearing up .
I was scared because it was my first time to -- see -- only people are crying .
Saints don't cry .
I saw that it seemed real but there was no light I didn't even hear a sound .
her eyes seemed alive and she's crying .
<no-speech>
it reached Father Ervin the Assistant Parish Priest of the parish .
what I really saw were drops of water falling from her eyes .
seemed like tears I really saw personally what the children were saying .
questions were added on the doubts and wonders of Father Ervin on the tears of the icon of Mary Mediatrix in their church .
we placed the icon here on the second week of January .
so the people who are going to church on the ninth day of novena mass before the feast will look here .
it's an open glass or not easily opened because we have the key .
<no-speech>
according to Father Ervin no one can easily open the orna of the Virgin because it's locked and the key's hidden .
there's no caretaker that cleans the icon as well because it's inside the glass which can't be easily dirty .
I even told the children that maybe it's just a joke .
but when I personally look at the icon while I was going there I felt guilty .
I tell myself why is she crying ?
what did I do wrong ?
what did -- what did really happen here why is she crying ?
it leads me to pray more right ?
it leads me to reflect the beauty of faith .
if humidity or sweat is suspected liquid why would it appear on the cheek ?
nevertheless they're not in the right position to say if the tears are true or made-up .
Father Ervin and I have no authority no capacity to declare this phenomenon as we recall right ?
it's the task where all of the Bishop to initiate an investigation (()) it's an investigation that will tell if it's worthy of belief or not .
in the records of the catholic church only one Virgin has been certified in the history .
<no-speech>
this is the Weeping Virgin Mary of Our Lady of Akita in Akita Japan .
it was in year ninety seventy-three when Sister Agnes saw the weeping Virgin and after fifteen years the statue was known as miraculous .
<no-speech>
the statue of Virgin Maria of Ichon visited by tourists was given by a group of devotees from Davao in the year twenty twelve .
it came from Lipa City in Batangas .
<no-speech>
this is not the first time the statue of Mary Mediatrix of All Grace was talked about to be miraculous .
<no-speech>
in year nineteen forty-eight in the convent of Our Lady of Lourdes of Mary Mediatrix of All Grace in Mount Caramel in Batangas it was said that the icon appeared successively in front of a nun Sister Teresita Castillo .
according to them the Virgin of Mary Mediatrix has showered fragrant leaves or petals of red roses multiple times .
<no-speech>
but it was year nineteen fifty-one when this testimony of Sister Teresita was declared as non-supernatural or not considered a miracle .
<no-speech>
because of the controversy the convent was temporarily closed .
it was in year nineteen ninety-one when the case of alleged apparition in Batangas was reopened after it was learned that there were irregularities on the investigation before .
until now it's an ongoing investigation of the Vatican .
<no-speech>
meanwhile we showed the weeping Virgin of Ichon to some experts .
in the long time that I've been making saints I have never seen a weeping icon unless it was faked .
it was showed how it's possible for an icon to weep .
they can drill a hole in it just really small .
they can let the tear fall whatever they used -- fell on the Virgin they can put a hose inside .
<no-speech>
and put water for her to tear up .
<no-speech>
second put petroleum jelly or whatever we'll use a blower for it .
this will serve as the sunshine .
the heat of the sun right now is so intense that it drips .
melt drip .
because of intense heat .
<no-speech>
but according to Father Dennis and Father Ervin .
it doesn't mean that this phenomenon although not yet declared may not be declared as a miracle would not be able to evoke in them and in us a feeling of the -- of the presence of the Holy right ?
that's why I said here after having seen the tear you may be lead to pray .
well and good .
lighting a candle to pray for people you love but do ask for your prayers .
as I've said many places are under persecution ethnic violence that we do not know but if you pray for them at least we'd be able to help them .
I don't know .
we'll face the issue as it is and as it will come right ?
when it's gone it doesn't mean that our faith would be gone .
no .
our faith does not rely on the tears .
<no-speech>
right now the bishop of Leyte has appointed someone to lead the investigation they will conduct regarding the alleged crying of Mary Mediatrix .
in the history of the Church there were many claims about the crying of the statue and then the experts with the Bishop form a team and team would investigate the incident and they -- they would find out later on that it was a fake .
<no-speech>
if they needed to conduct a thorough and more scientific investigation .
he called a commission in order to -- to deal with this incident whether it is supernatural or or -- or not .
<no-speech>
although this has not happened yet the believers stands firm even now .
