differential of AFP/PNP held off and issues on Pacquiao fight
retired police and military pleads, begs, implores, and kneels because their expected money for Noche Buena is currently a living for the followers of Satan!
what we're pointing out is the "differential" that amounts to more or less P7,400 for each that is still not being given out!
according to the complainants, there's information that some officials of Crame conspired to maintain the funds in the bank, to benefit from the interest!
at this point, we're giving a chance to the agencies responsible for the release of "differential" of retired police and soldiers to release it before Christmas.
if not, we'll investigate which demon is behind this deceit, and we'll skin them, brother, alive!
promise!
and we'll tie those animals, headfirst!
why can't we move on from this, the defeat of our national fist?
for that reason, the game was lost for Pacman and Bob to get money in the next game.
in that sense, the hit that knocked off Pacman wasn't actually hard!
son of a bitch, can't you see that Manny grimaced!
why don't you try getting a hit from Marquez so that you'd know!
your abdomen might swell from the impact of Marquez's "dynamite"!
according to Pacmom, the reason behind her son's loss is his change of religion or his deviation from being Catholic!
why, aren't there Catholics who lose?
there are lots!
for that reason, he's not wearing a rosary anymore.
hmm, I think, brother, even if Pacman romances with Rosario, Magdalena, or Alma, if the hit was really that strong, surely, you'll be knocked out!
why are we only blaming Rosario?
hahaha, even if we say that it was only luck, in other words, that was really a loss.
and it only proves that luck is more dominant than fortune!
