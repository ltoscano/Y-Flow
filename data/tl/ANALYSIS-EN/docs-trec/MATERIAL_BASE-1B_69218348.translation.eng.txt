Jojo and Mar
Amba's briefs by Roy "AMBA" Seneres
two more years and we will have a new President.
it appears that only Jojo Binay and Mar Roxas have the political machinery that can seat them in Malaca√±ang.
but what the people should ask is where will the campaign funds of Jojo and Mar come from?
it is estimated that a candidate for the presidency needs 3 billion pesos.
is Jojo a billionaire?
many are saying yes.
but where did his wealth come from?
before he became OIC mayor of Makati, he only had one car, a beat-up Volkswagen.
Mar is allegedly rich because he is the grandson of Don Amado Araneta who owns Araneta Coliseum and wide tracks of land.
he is a Filipino with Spanish blood.
where did the wealth of Don Amado come from?
was he or his ancestors given wide areas of land by the ruling Spaniards before the Philippines became free because of the heroism of Bonifacio and many others?
what baffles me, after our heroes overthrew the oppressive Spanish colonial government, those who became rich were people with Spanish blood, Araneta, Ortigas, Zobel, Ayala, Aboitiz and others, instead of Filipino families.
so the 2016 elections is the battle of two rich people.
the other has a big question mark on where his wealth came from, while the other one came from his Spaniard grandfather.
but it is certain that major businessmen in the Philippines like Lucio Tan, Henry Sy and other kings of contractualization will also give a huge contribution to the two presidential candidates.
donations will also likely come from gambling lords, drug lords and others.
so, contractualization, jueteng and proliferation of drugs will continue.
whoever wins from the two, is the loss of the country.
