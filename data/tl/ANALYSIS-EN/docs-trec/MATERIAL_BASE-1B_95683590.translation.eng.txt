having a college diploma is said to be the key for a more successful run in life but according to a study of CHED or Commission on Higher Education it is additional advantage if you are a graduate of what are considered the top three universities in the country .
for example if you are a graduate of U_P you will wait just over a month before you find a job .
job hunting is more than two months if you are from Dela Salle and Ateneo de Manila .
compared to three months or more if you are a graduate of other universities .
for -- but in the end supposedly the most important is still strategy and perseverance to snag the desired job .
you know it's true why why you were able to find a job quickly right Badeth ?
one month only right ?
less .
but you know that's that's what hurts because sometimes when they look at your resume the first they look at is the school .
you cannot qualify for the interview .
you haven't even dressed up yet .
but I know that they look at others too supposedly what's important to them now is the extra curricular activities that you did .
aside from your academics .
you know -- you know I had a job in an -- administration office of a corporation .
really before the application they segregate the students who are graduates of specific schools from those that are branded .
that's where they base the priority .
the others not seen and given opportunity because they graduated from generic universities are pitiful .
what they could afford .
but you know I believe that especially if they're a product of public school they're really determined .
many are really skilled in abilities if we are just talking about abilities .
