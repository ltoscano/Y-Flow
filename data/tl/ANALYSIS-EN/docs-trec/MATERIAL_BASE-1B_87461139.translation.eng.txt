editorial: push peace forward!
December 22, 2016 numerous chaos in various parts of the world now is saddening.
many lives are lost because of the differences of ideologies and faiths.
many citizens are evacuating from their only home and country just to preserve their lives.
refugees without shelter.
many take chances in travelling the seas but not fortunate to cross safely.
more saddening that not all countries are receiving them in welcome.
until now, while many nationalities, similar to us, are busy for Christmas and meeting the arrival of the New Year; they, who are driven away by war from their own homes, have no new homes where they can celebrate these occasions.
some of them might not have Christmas because of a different faith, but the parting of the years is celebrated by everyone, whatever be the race and religion.
we are so fortunate here in our country that we do not have this kind of chaos.
no suicide bombers, no war created by ISIS and Muslim extremist.
if there is a part in Mindanao which is tainted by this kind of chaos, our armed forces ensure that they are in control of the situation.
at simple glance, we do not count hundreds in each explosion or severe firefight of bullets and mortars.
the airstrikes have not been disrupting our sleep.
hope that we learn how to be grateful for this big blessing.
but as creations of the Almighty God who have compassion for others, it is our duty to become instruments of peace, not only this Christmas and in our own society but at all times and to anyone.
using social media, we can spread peace and love, not only to our fellow countrymen but also for other races, especially to the victims of war in their own country.
if we cannot do anything for them, a prayer is a big thing for their safety and for peace in their country.
