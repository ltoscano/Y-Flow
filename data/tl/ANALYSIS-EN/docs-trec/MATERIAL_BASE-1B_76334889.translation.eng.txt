luckily no one was hurt in the explosion .
meanwhile the M_N_L_F or Moro National Liberation Front and the B_I_F_F in North and South Cotabato have allegedly joined forces following the signing of the last annex of the Bangsamoro Framework Agreement .
live from Cotabato City Chino Gaston has a report Chino .
Jessica an improvised explosive device exploded again in the province of Maguindanao and despite -- we believe that its real target were the soldiers our news team as well as our other colleagues at work were almost involved .
(()) .
together with the other members of the media we accompanied the convoy of the Second Mechanize Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army in Mamasapano .
this afternoon they were heading to Rajah Buayan one of the areas controlled by the military and where they will launch an offensive against the B_I_F_F or Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters .
but in an instant %incomplete back it up back it up bro .

stay here .
stay here .

we are following several soldiers who are entering here at Rajah Buayan when this explosion happened on this stretch of road .
and you can see that there are black things in the middle of the road which are bomb particles that were thrown and part of the road that was destroyed .
luckily nobody was hurt in the explosion of the suspected improvised explosive device which allegedly used a one hundred five millimeter howitzer bullet as its main charge .
according to the military this is already a desperate tactic of the rebel group .
because they want to send a message that they are still a force to reckon with but in a very those those -- those terroristic activities terroristic ways indeed .
they don't even have military capability anymore .
at the same time they want to retaliate right ?
but overall this is a very desperate move on their part .
before this there was also an explosion of an I_E_D at Datu Saudi-Ampatuan last Saturday wherein six soldiers four civilians and two journalists were wounded .
despite the consecutive explosions the military is hoping that the situation in Maguindanao will go back to normal .
allegedly they already besieged the hideouts of B_I_F_F .
