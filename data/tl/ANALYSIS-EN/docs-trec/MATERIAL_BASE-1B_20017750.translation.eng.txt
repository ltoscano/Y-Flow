stop!
while continuing to be angry, you also continue to punish yourself.
maintaining anger is like catching red-hot coal with the intention of throwing it to the one you are angry with; you yourself are scalded and eventually will burn.
a problem that should not be bothered with anymore, instead create a solution for it.
a problem is not talked about, but made a solution for.
the right way is to inform the concerned, anything that angers or troubles you.
while you are carrying its weight, you are troubled further, and eventually it will harm you.
if you have no concern about the happenings in your surroundings, it is only proof that you have accepted and allow the violence, the corruption, the immorality happening.
because if you are truly angered, you will reveal it and boldly announce your real sentiment.
for whatever you want you can find many ways, and if it is something you do not like, you can make many excuses.
so you will be known for your actions, and not for your words.
it is easy to speak and deliver sentences, but what has more ground is where were you when your country needed you?
in front of the television and crazy over an actor.
pastime is basketball and entertainment is politics.
it is not surprising that you are left behind and angered when in difficulty.
whereas what should be blamed is your selfishness and lack of answer to the laments and calls of your country!
what are you jealous and angry about?
the success of others or your own failures?
