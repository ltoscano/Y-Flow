okay Chef enter .
the unique roll and food should not be difficult to make .
what I will teach you today will surely guarantee that you could do this at home .
come let us start .
milk plus hot dog plus old bread plus vanilla syrup plus egg yolk plus maple syrup plus butter plus cinnamon powder equals French toast hot dog roll .
<no-speech>
lets get our stock bread .
let's trim off the edges .
<no-speech>
to become more durable we need to fold the bread with our hands or rolling pin if we have it at home .
next ingredient which is our hot dog .
we could also put butter if we want it to become buttery but personally I won't because later we will also use butter in our next step .
<no-speech>
in a bowl we will make a French toast butter using fresh milk and egg yolk .
do you know how important is the egg yolk in this recipe ?
it helps bind it this will be that one that seals it .
for the appetizing aroma put some cinnamon and vanilla syrup .
<no-speech>
this is our assembly .

can you guess what we can be made with milk plus pancake plus egg plus oil plus sausage plus cheese ?
yes to another breakfast recipe which is sausage pancake rolls .
first step we will cook our sausage .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
we will do this first in this step because we want its fat to be rendered so its taste will go to our (()) .
<no-speech>
beat the egg and add nutritious milk .
don't forget the salt and pepper ah .
<no-speech>
cook this in a pan then set aside for the meantime while making the pancake .
<no-speech>
if pancake mix will be bought egg and milk are only needed to be added there .
let us pour the mixture to our non stick pan .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
okay after we cook out pancake it is ready for assembly .
first step is our scrambled egg our sausage our cheese .
what is the cheese for ?
for creaminess of course .
<no-speech>
for one hundred ten pesos four servings can already be made in the pancake dish which is perfect for kids .
we have plenty of leftover adobo in our chiller .
we can definitely use it in our next recipe .
tortilla wraps plus leftover adobo plus mayonnaise plus lettuce plus tomato equals C_L_T chicken lettuce tomato wraps .
<no-speech>
basically assembling is what we are only doing .
we will just take the leftover adobo we'll just spread it .
<no-speech>

<no-speech>
we can also mix mayonnaise into it .
<no-speech>
because it is rolled the vegetables are unnoticeable to picky little kids .

transfer it in a bowl when cooked .
we need to speed up the process a bit because while the meat is still how we will put the quick melt cheese for it to melt and to incorporate it (()) .
<no-speech>
put some pickles on this or cucumber soaked in vinegar to balance the taste of meat .
let's put them in the middle .
<no-speech>
to make the lumpia wrapper stick the most reliable to use is no other than egg white .
and it's cooking time .
my tip for the mothers it's away .
we will put something like this so that the splash will go that way and not towards us .
<no-speech>
for the sauce simply mix the mayonnaise tomato paste paprika and garlic .
<no-speech>
it has a sweet and smokey taste .
