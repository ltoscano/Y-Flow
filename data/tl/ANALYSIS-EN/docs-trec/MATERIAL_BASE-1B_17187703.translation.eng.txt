UST discussion: the university's care of the national language
by managing editor - February 1, 2017
the effectiveness of using Filipino as the main language in universities became a hot topic before among academics.
in the 1962 issue of Varsitarian, the main editorial stated the suggestion to spread Filipino as the everyday language inside the university.
this coincides with the superior use of English especially in academic discussion due to the American colonization of the Philippines.
according to the article, the university would have been a good place to mold the understanding of the youth, particularly the Thomasians, about the land they grew up in.
it also contradicted the belief that our native language may be antiquated so it should not be used anymore.
"language cannot be compared to a chair that has rusted due to prolonged seating, so it should be replaced with a better one.
it does not have shape, color, or form," it stressed.
the editorial even suggests, the university serves as the second home of students to prepare their futures as members of society.
if the use of Filipino will be maintained and it will begin in universities, native languages will surely remain alive in the future generations.
