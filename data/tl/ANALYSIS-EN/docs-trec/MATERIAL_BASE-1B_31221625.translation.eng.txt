it has been two days since Ronald Llamas has been silent .
and as a matter of fact it's hard to finish the eight eighty D_V_Ds .
as they say marathon -- that is a marathon .
marathon not what I was telling you senator earlier okay it was mentioned to me yesterday that it's a close friend of Secretary Llamas I'm not talking about someone from the congress and I'm talking about a guy .
he said the close friend of Secretary Llamas Secretary Llamas is really a senator and colleague the one you mentioned earlier down to earth and in fact the two companions of Secretary Llamas on Sunday -- the one being asked have we seen this ?
that's his child .
his two children really one oh -- once a month -- it's like they buy bulk -- it's like they buy bulk because it's the family's way of bonding watching D_V_D instead of asking the driver and bodyguard they go to those places themselves that's -- that's one side of that .
however on the other side what the Optical Media Board is saying is even if you catch Secretary Llamas buying pirated D_V_D in action he's not violating any law you can't just take them so come let's just buy D_V_D is that it Senator Alex ?
I'm -- I'm sure maybe it was even mentioned by Tunying earlier in D_Z_M_M to raise your hands if you haven't purchased D_V_Ds .
I'll tell you honestly that when I'm with my children I'll be forced as well when they tell me Papa I want this .
you can't do anything when someone approaches you for example while parking someone approaches you and tells you boss just for my first sale .
oh and if you're nervous Senator Alex to get caught while you are buying here I'll read this to you .
the purchase of pirated D_V_Ds not used for commercial activities does not entail a liability .
if you won't sell your purchased pirated D_V_D you have no liability .
that's what the law says said Attorney Coco Padilla .
oh my I don't know perhaps it's about time to revise add maybe an amendment for the O_M_B campaign to improve right ?
we're against -- pirates but because our law is apparently weak it's also useless .
but that -- but that is not the priority of the president which means this incident might even help Secretary Ronald Llamas to really fix the campaign against piracy .
because it is really true nothing is really happening -- let us admit that and not because no one is doing it .
it's getting -- numerous .
while arresting the -- the O_M_B so but it seems the pirated D_V_Ds have multiplied .
oh geez so not that the priority of the president nothing nothing nothing .
I have many -- I am busy it appears like that .
ah nothing nothing .
