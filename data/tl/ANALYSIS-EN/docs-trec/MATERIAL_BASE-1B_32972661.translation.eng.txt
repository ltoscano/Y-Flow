what is said? Alfred, already excited to make a scene in Encantadia! by Rose Garcia October 23, 2016 the congressman of District V of Quezon City Alfred Vargas admits that even in his three terms, he has really made public service his priority and this is very evident in his district and constituents, he still misses the show business.
especially acting which is really his passion.
so Alfred plans that every year, he can make even just one movie and one TV project.
in 2017, he will make his Cinemalaya entry "The Teacher Who Does Not Know How to Read" which will be directed by Perry Escaño.
Alfred is happy when director Mark called him and there is a possibility that will become a guest in Encantadia.
tomorrow, October 24 is Alfred's 37th birthday and instead of having a grand party, a week-long celebration will happen, where he will conduct different outreach and activities so more will be helped on.
Home Sweetie Home had a Halloween special theme which was aired last night.
John Lloyd Cruz (Romeo) thought that he saw a parking boy in the parking, only to find out that this is a zombie!
part 1 of the HSH episode last night and the second episode next Saturday.
special guests are Ellen Adarna, Sam Pinto, Queenie Rehman and Leo Priscilla.
