in the island of San Salvador in Zambales .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
fourteen year old Alfie woke up groggy .
<no-speech>
preparing for a day of diving for marine resources that is the source of their livelihood .
<no-speech>
mother Elenita was busy on the other hand on the packed food they'll bring in the sail .
<no-speech>
she narrates that Alfie is the youngest of ten siblings however only four of their children is living in the island .
<no-speech>
good morning .
good morning .
oh my that looks delicious .
<no-speech>
what time will we dive .
in a while around nine .
nine .
just after Alfie who stands as the man of the household while his father is in Aparri sailing .
<no-speech>
their means for additional income in the house is catching aquarium fish which is brought to Manila .
it's also my desire to to dive .
<no-speech>
they didn't stop me .
pity because he gets old sometimes .
sometimes he gets sick and now he can't carry -- heavy things unlike before .
<no-speech>
he's having a hard time .
I pity him .
that's why -- that's why I help him with the chores if -- heavy I help with the task .
<no-speech>
.
he borrowed one hundred pesos for gas for us to be able to sail .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
(()) .
<no-speech>
so how long will that be ?
we use one liter in two days or about two days .
<no-speech>
that is frugal too ?
yes .
it is very good value for money .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
.
<no-speech>
fishing is prohibited at the front shore in San Salvador even from nineteen eighty-nine this was made in to a marine sanctuary .
<no-speech>
we even need to cross the other island to catch fish .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
Alfie prepared to cross the water .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
one old mask and flippers made of wood are the only things of Alfie to do diving .
<no-speech>
holding breath under the sea is his style to catch aquarium fishes .
<no-speech>
using one small net Alfie chases the fishes to catch it .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
it is called to us (()) as only .
even all of children here also do that .
no one gets sick .
for that also helps us -- strengthens the -- .
strengthens resistance brother (()) we .
<no-speech>
in a short while I almost cannot view Alfie in how far he swam from our boat .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
the middle of the sea is rough and stony .
<no-speech>
Alfie dived more than ten feet .
<no-speech>
here he can freely dive and catch aquarium fishes .
<no-speech>
seems Alfie does not run out of breath when he dives .
<no-speech>
you should not have -- you have not breathe much because the bubbles are like -- they are afraid of the bubbles .
so you really you hold your breath .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
aside from the small net he is holding he has another net laid on the sand under the sea which serves as a bait for the fishes .
there are fishes there in the depths because of more space there .
you move around compared when you are on surface when you do that it is there .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
Alfie is also looking for a Harlequin shrimp .
he can sell this for twenty pesos for each piece .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
like playing simply .
like he is very familiar on on the territory .
just playing catching fish but if if you will look at that he is in the middle of the sea .
the waves are strong .
you do not know what you can hold .
you do not know what is dangerous or poisonous .
so if you really think about it what he is doing is really dangerous .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
Alfie moves very fast in -- in underwater .
<no-speech>
he is chasing those fishes .
he has -- caught a lot .
me I have tried but really difficult .
the high low I cannot control I do not know when I would rise when I would lower down then you would still need to catch the fish .
it is difficult .
<no-speech>
brought by the strong waves I have deemed it necessary to rise .
<no-speech>
I have risen now because it is too tiring and I feel like dizzying .
I do not know if my baggage earlier is too heavy or the way -- way I breathe but Alfie there until now still fishing .
seems so tireless .
have made it a playground .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
Alfie dived the whole afternoon with his mother Elenita .
<no-speech>
uh I already know his the what well his ability in diving .
he is used to it .
because I will not allow him to dive like that if I know he won't be able to bear it .
<no-speech>
if Alfie is catching aquarium fishes in the middle of sea mother Elenita is only diving in around six feet .
she puts starfishes sea urchins and other small fishes in her pail .
<no-speech>
the starfish they are able to sell for ten pesos and above .
while the sea urchin they can make it their dish .
<no-speech>
these mother and son are doing this even if some parts of the ocean of San Salvador is a marine sanctuary .
<no-speech>
the local government has also prohibited the fishing and catching of aquarium fishes before .
<no-speech>
later on they have just permitted because those who live in the island of San Salvador has no other means of livelihood .
