Armed Forces of the Philippines declared that there are no more threats of terrorism in Bohol and other -- claimed tourist destination in the country .
this was said by A_F_P spokesperson brigadier general Restituto Padilla in the conducted press briefing at Malacañang after the bloody encounter of military and Abu Sayyaf group in Bohol .
the armed forces is and the Philippine National Police is happy to inform you that the threats we face in the island of Bohol and the other unconfirmed report -- reports that have been coming our way as well as to the public regarding dangers post by terrorists in our tourist areas is already addressed .
<no-speech>
the Bohol incident manifested a very deep seated plan on the part of terrorist to sow discord and to target high value individuals where they can earn a lot from .
two of the hunted of Abu Sayyaf group are already identified by the military .
we know who they are generally in what area and effort is still being done to pursue them .
but as I mentioned a while ago the assessment of the central command particularly the one given to me by the general Oscar Lactao is that this two are fighting for their survival so they don't post any serious threat anymore .
the counterintelligence of the military is allegedly not stopping despite the involvement of police officer Maria Christina Nobleza with the Abu Sayyaf .
but at present A_F_P remains firm in the discussion .
so the effort of counterintelligence in checking our ranks for any possible informants or those who can be working with the enemy never ceases never stops .
so it's done in a twenty four seven basis it is continuing and it is focused on specific areas that commit possibly threatening to our security .
A_F_P put a deadline to end the Abu Sayyaf including the Maute group until July .
Padilla also confirmed the deliver of surrender feeler of Isnilon Hapilon one of the leaders of Abu Sayyaf .
that is just our self-imposed deadline to adequately address and degrade the capacity of these groups .
so we have also been pushing and claim and saying all along that the solution to all these problems is not purely military .
we are not the answer to all these problems .
what we are trying to push is a comprehensive approach that will go down to the roots of all these problem and address it adequately .
currently there are only three hundred left of the Abu Sayyaf from the five hundred and Jolo remains as their fortress .
