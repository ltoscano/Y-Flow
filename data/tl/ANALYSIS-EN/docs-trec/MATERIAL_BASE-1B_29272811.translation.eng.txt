a system of "whatever comes" in marriage
"marriage is not like a rice that you feed in, and when you get burned, you can spit it out," the old ones said.
not only to some but many young people have fallen to danger, to separation from their support in life or spouse, because of familial problems that they are experiencing because they are not ripe to wade through a married life.
their children are suffering, losing a real father and mother to guide them, but when they cannot endure each other, in the difficulty of carrying out the married life.
in our observation of the current times, those who are getting married are becoming younger and younger.
the one in your service has a question to lovers.
do you have a sufficient age and ability to raise a family?
have you finished your studies and have a stable livelihood?
or, you are giving difficulty to your parents because they are going to raise your new family, and you are going to live with them?
how will it be, when you are short of money, because you have not finished school yet and does not have a livelihood?
where are you going to get the rent for the house, payment for electricity, water, food for the every day, various expenses, especially in the time now, the kind of lifestyles seemed to be higher?
we cannot tell the words "whatever comes," because, surely, this will cause our lives with uncertain future which will bring anyone to danger.
so for the youth, even those in the right age, who are dreaming of wading through a married life, but has not stable livelihood.
pray and ask guidance from God before you decide on your tasks.
do not hurry, there are many opportunities which will arrive in your life which will cause relief, happiness which you will never ever regret until you get old, because you have done what is right.
