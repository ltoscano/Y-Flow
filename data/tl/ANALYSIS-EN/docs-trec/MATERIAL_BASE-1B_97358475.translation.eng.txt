extreme flood is the result of the continuous rain since last night .
classes are cancelled to almost whole Metro Manila and to some neighboring province .
but just like before the problem again is the belated suspension of classes of the students which is now the job of the mayors .
Mia Reyes tell the story .
past eleven o'clock last night heavy rain poured .
immediately the flood water rose to some parts of Quezon city .
at the Cubao Aurora underpass the water was leg-deep .
at Talayan village the creek overflowed .
<no-speech>
but because of the continuous rain the flood at V Luna street in Pinahan village was waist-deep .
this taxi could not overcome the water .
it broke down in the middle of the street and was almost submerged in the flood that reached the hood .
the other cars no longer attempted to enter the street .
two submersible pumps from the M_M_D_A were used to suck the water on the street towards the creek at Nia road .
the M_M_D_A stated that aside from stagnant trash there were rocks as large as hollow blocks that were blocking the drainage .
there was also a building foundation that was seen blocking the flow of the water .
let us refer that to our legal -- legal of the M_M_D_A what the sanctions are so that they will understand that what they're doing is wrong .
in the nearby school of V Luna Flora Ylagan high school there was confusion regarding the suspension of classes .
this father was drenched when he fetched his child around nine o'clock in the morning .
Lito Mijares even rushed to the principal's office because the cancellation of classes was allegedly unclear .
I told him to contact the principal's office .
tell them you said there was an announcement on the T_V -- on the radio station that there will be no classes at Flora Ylagan .
the principal's office said there was no declaration from them yet .
<no-speech>
but the principal placed the blame on the Quezon city government .
the main problem at Quezon city aside from the very large seemingly no coordination right .
the Palace apologized for the late announcement .
it was possible that the L_G_U who are mandated to decide on the suspension of classes are still new to this .
in the protocol released by the president at only four thirty in the morning the mayors should have suspended the classes .
but DepEd recommended that it should be decided by ten o'clock until four o'clock of daybreak if classes will be suspended or not .
but in the end it is still the parents decision if they will have their children enter or not .
