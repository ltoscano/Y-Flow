the role of Joyce Ching in the new Kapuso afternoon series, Despise All.
Joyce has mixed feelings in accepting her character.
according to Joyce, "at first, I just had fear.
because I did not want it to appear fake.
"because of course, I haven't been pregnant yet.
so I don't know the feeling of how it feels to have a dilemma that I might be pregnant.
that is where I felt fear.
because I want it to be just natural when we do those scenes."
in its teaser, her lips-to-lips with Kristoffer Martin was a huge hit.
Joyce already left behind her sweet image.
she will wear a two-piece swimsuit on the show.
"I'm a swimmer here and since I am a rebel here, I'm a rule breaker. so while all my teammates are wearing one-piece swimsuits, I wear a two-piece swimsuit," said Joyce.
aside from Kristoffer, Snooky Serna, Eula Valdez and Ariel Rivera are co-stars here.
