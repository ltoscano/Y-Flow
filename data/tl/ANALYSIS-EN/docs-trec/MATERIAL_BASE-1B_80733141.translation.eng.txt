Secretary De Lima, man of the hour.
strike while the iron is hot.
Leila de Lima, Secretary of Justice, is now the man of the hour because many consider de Lima as the winner in her fight with Iglesia ni Cristo.
Iglesia rallied at Padre Faura and at the corner of Shaw but the one million people, whom its leaders promised, did not come.
aside from this, their appeal to have De Lima ousted from position did not also push through.
is this a sign that the followers of Iglesia are not that many anymore?
De Lima is planning to run as a senatorial candidate in the coming election.
there are some who are saying that the vote of Iglesia as a block is important, which is why there is a risk that she would lose in this election.
there are some who say that it is already time for De Lima to run for vice president under the ticket of Mar Roxas, who is saying that it is also the time to have a president from the Visayan region again.
even if Iglesia manages to accumulate one or two million votes against De Lima, it seems that this sect will still be short of votes.
those who are not members of Iglesia have a strong sympathy for De Lima.
De Lima should take advantage of this chance before this issue cools down.
it is said that there is Catholic backlash, aside from the Born Again and other protestant groups, and this is what Leila needs to take care of.
before this controversy even cools down, the wheels of justice need to be put in motion or turned so that the cases of the Iglesia ministers regarding the alleged serious illegal detention can be resolved.
whether De Lima will win as vice president will depend on her ability to beat Senator Antonio Trillanes or Alan Cayetano or even Chiz Escudero.
I have a feeling that Iglesia will not vote for Trillanes.
it is also probable that many Catholics will not vote for Chiz because he allegedly seems to be pro-Iglesia.
