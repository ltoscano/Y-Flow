bad news my siblings the Commission on Higher Education approved the tuition free increase of more than two hundred colleges in the whole country .
what's also tragic is that it's like us parents are just going to be surprised because the CHED declined to reveal which schools they gave a go signal to .
Gerard Garcia tell the story .
Mercy doubles her hard work in selling food to have something to pay for the tuition in college her seventeen year old child is taking Business Administration .
we work hard everyday so somehow we also earn fare for my child .
but starting this June people like Mercy will have a more difficult time .
because Commission on Higher Education has already approved the tuition increase up to ten percent of more than two hundred private colleges .
thirty-three here in N_C_R .
that's why the twelve thousand that Mercy pays every semester will be added with one thousand two hundred pesos which could have been used to buy school supplies for her child .
they shouldn't have increased the tuition fee so that the students and parents don't have a very difficult time .
the Kabataan party list condemned the tuition-increase .
access to college education might diminish .
that's why we're anticipating that there might be an increase on dropout rates .
but CHED insists that tuition-increase underwent due consultation with schools and parents .
it's a necessity to also increase the salary of our teachers .
they can apply for CHED scholarships as long as the student's grades are high and the parent's earnings won't go higher than thee hundred thousand pesos .
it's possible that there will be a higher number of colleges that will increase their matriculation in the opening of school year this June .
but CHED assures that the tuition of state colleges and universities won't increase .
