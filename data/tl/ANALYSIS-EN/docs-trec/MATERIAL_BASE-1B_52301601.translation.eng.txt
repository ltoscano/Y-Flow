according to DOH-Mimaropa regional director (RD) Eduardo Janairo, this is to ensure the safety of our fellowmen visiting resorts.
at present, up to 336 people in Palawan have passed the five-day DOH WASAR Training.
the number is more than half of 500 people targeted by DOH-Mimaropa for the region.
the latest training was held in the town of Coron where 17 people passed on May 23-27.
through knowledge of WASAR, RD Janairo believes that the trainees can immediately help those drowning.
aside from this, the dangers faced by rescuers or rescuers will decrease whatever the condition of the water may be: calm, full of waves, flood or river.
the DOH WASAR Training or training of lifeguards and emergency responders is part of a bigger program - the Health in Tourism - launched by DOH-Mimaropa on March 24 in Puerto Princesa.
