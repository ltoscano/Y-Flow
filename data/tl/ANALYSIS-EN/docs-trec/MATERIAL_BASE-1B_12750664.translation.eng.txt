the thieves scheme at the port, dismantled!
Bureau of Customs Commissioner Ruffy Biazon already found the two masterminds of hao-xiao who were believed to be the mastermind of the syndicates that was dismantled recently by the said agency.
the shameless pretentious employees who work in Aduana have their masks finally worn off.
it was exposed that one of them was an alias Rene and had been an extortionist in Aduana who introduced himself as Biazon's relative and acquainted to Biazon's wife.
but even the shadow or fur of this shameless alias Rene is never known to Biazon, instead, he is firing the accomplices of this alias Rene.
discovered in the investigations that the damn alias Rene usually drag the name of the presidential adviser to his syndicate to be feared in Aduana.
Rene is usually seen roaming at Customs and is seen to suddenly appear on occasions where the said commissioner is invited.
a lot consequentially thought that the two are very close but in reality, this is the way of alias Rene to make everyone believe that the commissioner is his relative.
so when Biazon learned that Rene is the mastermind of the shamelessness in the Customs, he immediately commanded Enforcement Security Service Chief General George Alino of his arrest.
it was noted from the intelligence report of the BOC that the reason why Rene was able to scheme is because he was protected by two Customs officials, alias "Teddy" and "Jojo K.", who were former military.
