in this rehabilitation facility in Antipolo drug dependents are spending part of their time for therapy in drawing and coloring .
according to a non profit group a partner of the rehabilitation facility art therapy is a big help for them to diagnose the condition of the patients .
this is also where they can share what their feelings .
so now so through art they can express whatever they feel .
so for those things which they cannot say they cannot put into words they can put it through a drawing and then they can express whatever they feel .
<no-speech>
there are some written by their family and some that still seems brokenhearted .
after drawing they will meet to explain their creations .
the group Center for Christian Recovery aims to help drug dependent people who wants to change .
they also wanted to show President Rodrigo Duterte that they still have hope and there are other -- solutions to suppress the problem in illegal drugs .
I am a witness of the people that changed .
it's difficult for them .
they really want to recover but it's really hard .
if we will end their lives we will not be able to give them a chance to understand life more .
apart from art therapy there are also counseling programs for the drug dependents .
there were some patients that called and asked for the president to not to kill them because some of them still has the desire to change .
hopefully our president will take action on this .
we still have a chance to change .
it's not too late .
