Puerto Princesa, Palawan, August 25 (PIA) - the farmers of Barangay Marangas in Bataraza, Palawan recently received the Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOA) from the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR).
this was after DAR succeeded to pass to the 63 farmers the ownership of the 43 hectares of land, which was formerly owned by the Agro-Marine Industrial Corporation, under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform (CARP).
"like a thorn was pricked out of us, seemed impossible, like a dream that we can finally farm the land given by the government to us," said Allan Bello, President of the Boli Ponti Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries' Association (BPARBA).
the Association is composed of farmers whose primary wish is to be asserted in the government that the ownership covered by CARP be given to them.
only this July 28 until 29, DAR officials went to the places along with the troops of the Philippine National Police (PNP), Marine Battalion Landing Team (MBLT) 12 and few personnel of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) to lead the farmer beneficiaries and to settle safely in the said land.
the farmers immediately started the building of temporary shelter in the place after the ownership of the land is passed to them which is granted by the government.
according to DAR, in the total of 206 hectares of land under CARP, in accordance to Republic Act 6657, about 193 hectares is already distributed to the 151 farmer beneficiaries.
the other part of the land is determined as inappropriate for agriculture.
