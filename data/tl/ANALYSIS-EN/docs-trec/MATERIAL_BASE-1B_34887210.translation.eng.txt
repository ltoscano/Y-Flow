the floats of the movies Girl Boy Bakla Tomboy and Pagpa Siyam Na Buhay are also present .
and of course the float of My Little Bossings won't be missed where a cute house is used as a design .
the star contestants in the film festival are happy for the reception of the people for their floats .
and the viewers can expect to enjoy in the movies that they have starred in .
of course we have prepared this for a year .
and uh very excited and very proud of My Little Bossings uh Bimbi and Raiza and of course my original Little Bosing who is Aiza .
my sisters said that it is already a fact and six years old he already made that first movie and they said all of them when Bim is crying they are also crying .
