to God and to Cesar glorify thy name by father Edd B. Lleva
the Lord enthroned Ciro to conquer the countries
the Lord opened the country gates for him
he was called upon to help Israel who is serving the Lord's chosen country
the Lord said: "I am the one and only God." worship the majestic power of God.
Pablo reminded us that we should commemorate the fruits our faith in the presence of the Lord which was brought about by love and strong hope in Jesus.
the Pharisees were discussing how to entrap Jesus parallel to his words regarding tax.
"teacher, we know that you are righteous and you teach the whole truth on what God wants man to do.
you do not favor anyone because in your eyes all men are equal.
what do you think?
is it according to the law to tax Cesar or not?" Jesus was aware of their ill intention of trapping him so he said: "give me the tax money." he asked whose image and name is on the dinar.
they answered: "it is Cesar's" "if that is so, give to Cesar what Cesar is due and to God what God is due."
in our current times, we are required to pay tax to the BIR for our commodities, businesses and hard earnings.
what's Cesar's is Cesar's and what's God's is God's.
why are we so stingy to God, especially us Catholics.
we are following Jesus in that we shouldn't give tithes but voluntarily give alms.
other religions are required to give their tithes.
even other groups of Catholics are making the collection of their tithes compulsory.
why?
let us also ask ourselves.
are we giving the right amount of tax to the government and are we giving God our absolute worship, honor and repentance?
are we accounting the right amount of tax to the country and are we giving enough contribution to the church.
"what's Cesar's is Cesar's and what's God's is God's.
