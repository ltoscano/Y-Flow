Filipinos have no regard for history - the Red House
yes that is correct!
it seems that we really have no regard for our history so it is just all right if things related to it are destroyed.
in fact it seems we have forgotten the monstrosities done during the time of Marcos.
anyway, this post of ours is about the Red House in San Ildefonso, Bulacan that at present is eventually being destroyed and will disappear from our sight.
why is it important?
let us watch the video so we can find out what the Red House really is.
Red House ...
it is saddening to think that because of others' continuing destruction of the Red House it will gradually disappear, I thought it appropriate to upload this video so we can remember how important the Red House is to the history of our nation.

how can the municipal government of San Ildefonso or even the provincial government allow for a historical location like this to vanish?
will they do nothing to stop or care for it?
doesn't the state have an imminent domain that can be used.
like what our companion from the blog Republika Natin says, "come let us take action for our country".
observe its pitiful appearance now.
doesn't it make you grit your teeth?
hope that you will share this issue and make it known to the authorities.
