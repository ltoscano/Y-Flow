Zambales fishermen now sail in WPS by Jojo Perez September 3, 2016 fishermen of Zambales city rejoiced China's permission for them to fish in Scarborough Shoal in West Philippine Sea (WPS).
the approval of China for fishermen to sail in Panatag Shoal is the result of President Duterte's meeting with Chinese Ambassador Zhao Jianhua yesterday.
in the interview of Abante with fisherman, Ruben Correa of Masinloc, Zambales, he said that after a long time of prohibiting them to continue their livelihood in WPS, they're very grateful to President Rodrigo Duterte.
"it has also been a couple of years of tiptoeing just to fish in Panatag (Shoal), although we didn't want to gamble before because we were afraid of the coast guard of China," according to Correa.
