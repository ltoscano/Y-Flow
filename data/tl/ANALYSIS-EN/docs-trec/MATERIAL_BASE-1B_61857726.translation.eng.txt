PNoy is a great example of gun possession
although he is the highest official in the country, president Aquino did not hesitate in issuing a 'gun ban exemption' to the Commission on Elections (Comelec) last Thursday to continue carrying his personal gun.
however, the agency clarified that as the highest leader of the country it is not necessary for the president, commander-in-chief of Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), because the gun ban is not there to suppress the operation of the military.
since a gun enthusiast, president Noynoy wanted to always carry his personal gun that he uses for his practical shooting.
there is only one meaning behind the actions of the president - he is one responsible gun owner.
president Aquino did not take advantage of his position to violate the law.
it is definitely possible for him to not get an exemption for the gun ban together with the members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) however president PNoy showed to the nation equality and to not use biases.
for president Aquino, the total gun ban should not push through because this could make way to worse chaos in the country since responsible gun owners would be restrained from carrying their things and only bad elements are the ones left carrying guns because they worry about nothing if they ever got caught for carrying firearms without enough documents.
bad elements logic would be, if ever they get caught, they can always bail themselves out.
as long as they will not be revealed to be protecting syndicates.
