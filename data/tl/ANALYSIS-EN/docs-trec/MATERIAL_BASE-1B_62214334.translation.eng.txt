January 14, 2016 City of Koronadal, South Cotabato, January 14 (PIA) - even though the celebration of the 76th foundation anniversary and the 16th Hinugyaw Festival of Koronadal City had just finished, the city government's preparations are again on the way for a few important activities to be held here this year.
this 2016, according to Koronadal city administrator Cyrus Urbano three national events are set to be held here in the city.
first of these is the National Schools Press Conference on the 22nd up to 26 of February.
an estimated 5,000 delegates from all the regions of the country are expected to arrive here to participate in the annual schools press conference headed by the Department of Education.
the Private Schools Athletic Association (PRISAA) National Collegiate Games scheduled on the 2nd up to 9th of April will happen here too.
in the description of Urbano the PRISAA meet is the National Games of the private schools of the Philippines.
aside from the two mentioned, the city administrator also confirmed that the National Bible Conference will also be held in Koronadal City.
Urbano emphasized that holding national events here is an opportunity for the city's economy to grow.
in earlier interviews, City Treasurer Marloun Gumbao explained, that even if the city government spends for the execution of these kinds of events, the expenditures return to the city treasury because the guests participating in the said activities will also spend.
it is also a good opportunity to attract investors because the guests themselves will see the opportunities to do business here.
Koronadal City is the administrative seat of the SOCCSKSARGEN Region.
