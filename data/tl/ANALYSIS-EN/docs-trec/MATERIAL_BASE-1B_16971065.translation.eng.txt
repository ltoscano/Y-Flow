many say that just as Ian ages that's when his career his blooming.

"actually, no.
it's just that my friends really tease me, "hey, it's like this and like that."
just as I'm getting old, that's when it became like that.
it's like I'm not affected, I just don't take it personally.
it just works.
I've been doing this for my whole life.
used to having a camera there sometimes, like that, with attention.
but I do not take it personally because it's just work," he declared.
