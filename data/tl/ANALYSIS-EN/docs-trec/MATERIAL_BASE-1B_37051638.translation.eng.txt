in opinion
was the health secretary not thinking when she said that next year they will start giving away condoms in schools to prevent the continuous increase in cases of HIV/AIDS among the youth?
as early as now, objection can be felt not only from the Catholic church but also from parents and different groups against the plan of the DOH.
why the department is not properly focusing on information campaigns about HIV/AIDS and the problematic root causes like premarital sex, having multiple sexual partners and correct family planning, either through natural ways or through the use of contraceptives.
the DOH should not have pressed on with their plan of giving condoms to the youth in schools because it will only worsen the situation and give ideas to the children that having sex is okay because they have condoms or sex is okay as long as they are protected.
we can see the DOH's strong advocacy to control the spread of HIV/AIDS in the country, but not through the distribution of condoms only.
education is still the best response and defense against the continuing increase in cases of this deadly disease.
