Anthony pleas to fellow athletes July 10, 2016 NBA star Carmelo Anthony pleaded yesterday (Manila time) to athletes to "come out" and "demand change," after a police shooting that killed two black men and five officials who were also officers of the law in Dallas.
Anthony, the New York Knicks forward focused on the unprecedented third men's Olympic basketball gold medal in Rio de Janeiro on August 5-21, expressed his message on social media encouraging athletes to call for change in a system he called "broken.
point blank period."
"I'm calling for all my fellow athletes to step up and take charge.
go to your local officials, leaders, congressman, assemblymen/assemblywoman and demand change.
there's no more sitting back and being afraid of tackling and addressing political issues anymore."
five officials were killed, and seven police officers and two civilians were injured in Dallas last Thursday night in a sniper-style attack on the peaceful protest against police brutality that caused the death of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota.
Anthony, 32, stressed that his advocacy for social justice is much more important than staying silent and scared of turning away sponsors.
"we can't worry about what endorsements we gonna lose or (who's) going to look at us crazy.
I need your voices to be heard," Anthony carefully stated.
the 14-year NBA veteran insisted, he agrees to lead the movement but up to the present nobody has shown interest.
"I'm all about rallying, protesting, fighting for our people.
look I'll even lead the charge, by any means necessary," he even shared in his post.
"we have to be smart about what we are doing though.
we need to steer our anger in the right direction."
"our anger should be towards the system... we have to put the pressure on the people in charge in order to get this thing we call justice right."
