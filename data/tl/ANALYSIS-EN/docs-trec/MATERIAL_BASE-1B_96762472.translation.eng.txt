Filipinos always follow the trend and because a model-like face is a trend some of those who have fatty face with prominent jaws turn to technology for a solution .
this is the latest now this is the R_F with cavitation which can make the face smaller and firmer .
seems like those who are in middle-age like a face-lift without a surgery .
for the children they seem to lose the chubby cheeks .
and before it is painful to cut off some flesh cut off from a healthy cheek and face because of modern technology it is painless now .
it is not frightening because it does not have a wound .
usually we make them undergo a facial first because for example if they go straight to R_F or cavitation they might get pimples .
of course he's massaged we remove the whiteheads blackheads first .
in one treatment change can already be seen .
but supposedly if they want the face to thin down they need to undergo three to four treatments .
it can be for women for men for children for old people because it's really non-invasive .
it has no side effect .
they can see the changes in their face immediately after the treatment .
