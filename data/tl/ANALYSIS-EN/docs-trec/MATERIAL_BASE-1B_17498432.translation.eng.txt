because of fireworks in almost 600 victims of fireworks this recent New Year, majority of them came from a poor family.
most are squatters or some reside in adjoined rooms for rent in the city, especially in Metro Manila.
why do you think is that?
even in accidents, the people struggling in life are showered with misfortune?
they almost can't afford food for Noche Buena, but they still get to be unlucky and have relatives involved in accidents?
I found the answer when I got to a place of squatters in Antipolo last Tuesday or a day after the New Year's eve.
here are children happily playing with fireworks, and even had no slippers while their parents, without care, are talking to each other.
in the streets, you can see a pile of garbage from the fireworks.
if these people just put aside the money they used for clothes of their children instead, or even things for school, the money spent on fireworks would have been used for significant things.
wrong choices, wrong priorities.
this is the reason why many of our fellowmen can't escape from the quicksand of poverty.
this is a reflection of their wrong perspective about how they properly run their family.
for them, the noise coming from their lighted fireworks are enough happiness.
for them, the noise of fireworks will shoo away the misfortune, and not their ability to strive and exert effort to escape poverty.
they didn't think that they do this yearly, and yet their misfortune still continues.
what's bad is if the result wasn't a cut finger, it would be their shabby houses in ash, burned just because of some useless fireworks.
