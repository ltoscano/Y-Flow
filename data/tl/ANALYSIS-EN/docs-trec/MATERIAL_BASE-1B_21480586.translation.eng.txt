push this! Pauleen shouted angrily with an AlDub fan (it seemed) because of Patricia!
"so, could not be our friend
Patricia because "you just thought so"
and, Alden with her?" -Pauleen
by Glenn Regondola September 20, 2016 Pauleen Luna-Sotto could not stop to react in the innuendos of a critic where she is accused of being fake in voting for Alden Richards and Maine Mendoza love team.
because in reality, Pauleen really bets for the Eat Bulaga co-host Patricia Tumulak,
in a post by someone @bet_bat, Pauleen was indirectly hinted, based on the picture where the wife of Boss Vic is smiling while the two are singing. she said, "eyes who are always watching #pauleenlunasotto
"the best friends of Patricia Tumulak will be mad."
Pauleen answered this, "are you okay, sister? prohibited to watch? Hahaha! you!" it was followed by the EB host with, "do you have a problem with me?"
the critic has also exchanged messages with another netizen supported by Pauleen.
because of this, the wife of Boss Vic could not avoid to answer with a longer message.
"I seriously do not understand what you're talking about. it is difficult to talk to a person with a closed mind and listening and believing only herself. so, did she mean that we cannot befriend Patricia because she just thought they are together with Alden? we should not notice her because you do not like it?"
"sorry, our manners are not bad and moreover, we are not liars. believe what you want to believe. we are happy here. hope you are too. God bless."
also in the comment section, Pauleen only received support from various netizens and criticisms received by the negative netizen.
serves her right, yes?
