nightmare in Juan's town tweet nowadays, it feels good to sleep because of the slowly cooling temperature as summer ends and the rainy season takes its place. that's why everyone is at ease.
But why are Juan and Juana dela Cruz suddenly awakened from their slumber because of the daily struggles they face?
why else? they are constantly reminded by the continued rise of oil prices which causes an increase in the prices of commodities, services such as electricity, water, and education.
the people are deeply concerned about what's going on in their motherland.
however, they've done nothing to urge the country's leaders to solve the problem of the people.
are we contented with always being dictated and continuously accepting the said development of the government?
The government has shown no proof of the Philippines' growth and development.
the only things growing are the pockets of the government officials who do nothing but engage in corruption.
What should the people do in order to stop the nightmare that disturbs their deep slumber?
They must act.
but how?
Start by raising the children to love the country.
prioritize the welfare of the majority and not oneself.
Teach them that stealing, like what the puppets of the government do, is bad and, most of all, listen before passing judgement.
nowadays, if you're an ally of the Aquino administration and a member of the Liberal Party, you are automatically safe from any accusation by witnesses in the hearing of anomalies such as the "pork barrel scam."
from there, it can be seen that our leader has no love for the country even though he insists on the "righteous way," because he allows his country to fall into despair along with the people.
It can also be seen that the leader takes thieves under his wing because there are accusations that go unnoticed and, instead, his opponent is emphasized.
that's why one day, it won't be a surprise if the Philippines falls by drowning in debt and poverty.
