tonight let us learn how difficult it is to become a cadet either for a man or woman .

<no-speech>
good evening .

this is what we call a reveille for the cadets need to wake up to prepare their things .
but sometimes there are cadets who really sacrifice to wake up at zero four hundred or zero four o'clock in the morning for their preparation to be more intensified .
<no-speech>
this is not easy that is just fine for one normal civilian .
this is used with a hanger to really flatten the bunk he sleeps on and also needs to iron his bed to be in order and does not crease .

<no-speech>
(()) good morning (()) .

here at the P_M_A we have different culture .
especially in -- the way we eat .
one of these are -- one of the differences here is the way the underclass eats or especially the plebeian and the upper class .
<no-speech>
the upper class men are first class cadets or those who are in their fourth year at the P_M_A .
second class cadets are in the third year .
and the third class cadets are in the second year .
the fourth class cadets are those in first year .
they are also called as plebeians .
if you are a plebeian you need to learn how to know yourself first .
and you need to learn obey followership .
until when if you learn how to follow you will know yourself .
lead one group .
and if you are already in the first class you are now expected to lead the whole cadet core of the Armed Forces of the Philippines .
<no-speech>
we also have what we call as head up or chin where the plebeians tilt their heads and pulled their chins backwards .
this is to correct their posture .
because when still a civilian the cadets are not really that conscious about their postures .
<no-speech>
the plebeians are also serving the Firsties or the fourth class in eating .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
each movement of a plebeian is quick but detailed and meticulous .
<no-speech>
the first thing he does when he sits down he needs to fix his utensils .
he is going to get his rice which will be arranged fixed in a half moon .
this is to instill in him that -- all things need to have an order .
<no-speech>
after that then he could get his dish where he needs to shred first .
then after that he needs to move the fork first then he will sit down in attention .
next is he will get rice then he will sit down in attention then he could eat the -- rice and will return to he will put his self in attention again then he will return the fork then he will chew and that will be swallowed .
.
<no-speech>
they are memorizing information about their upper class men -- upper class men such as name of place birthday this is our way to train or sharpen their memory and become attentive and they are focused even on the smallest thing .
<no-speech>
this is the reason why even if they have long been gone from the P_M_A those who came from this institution still know each other .
<no-speech>
shouting or reproaching of the upper class men to the plebeians are just normal .
it's to train them how to cope up in a situation which is slightly chaotic .
when -- everything is chaotic everything does not know what to do you because of what you learned here at the P_M_A that is on your amount .
that trouble whatever is thrown at you you can still stand to make a decision because your mind has not been affected .
all cadets are going through this .
they have to put in mind first what their upper class needs before they eat .
because time will come they will also arrive on the stage that they will be served at .
<no-speech>
after eating they will return to the barrack before their day starts .
then they will face the police call or inspection in all rooms of the cadets .
is this room all right ?
.
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
if there are mess here in the rooms and all of that will be reported if there are violations that will be committed such as loitered things .
the shoes should be aligned .
the bunks our sleeping quarters should be in order as they have fixed it .
then those should be ironed out before the cadet goes out and be on duty .
.
demerit or deduction of points to a cadet if he has not cleaned or organized the room or things .
.
<no-speech>
it is important for the cadets to follow these regulations to remain inside the P_M_A .
even if you're in first class -- or fourth class there are designated areas to clean .
example in our room that is personal responsibility of the -- of each cadet to the room .
the lives of the cadets revolve around discipline .
this becomes the guide %incomplete
