go with the flow
let go and let it be, so there will be a result ... but if you meddle with it and tried over again,
this is pointless.
I have already experienced this, when you're riding a raft and it is carried away by the current and you fell, don't resist the rush of the current, instead lie straight on your back, float and allow to be carried away, kick and swing your hands and go with the flow, this will bring you to a silent place for your safety.
but if you relentlessly swing your arms and kick, you are resisting the fast current.
in the long run, you will be deprived of strength and even hit the rocks.
this will cause you harm; to be wounded and lose consciousness to drown.
this is also how life is explored, there are many heavy things or situation with no simple answer or solution.
we need to let time set the solution.
it is important that we accept the truth that there is nothing we can do with things that don't concern us and are uncertain.
instead, let us long for everyone to have blessings and on the path of good for everyone.
nobody knows why a thing or situation happens in our life.
if this is a blessing or curse, the only one who knows is the great creator.
keep an open mind in life, because it deliberately and continuously reveals your fate.
this is the key to be at peace amidst the furious surge that is thrown at you by fate.
if you are faced with a serious problem beyond your control and ability, the wise solution here is to get carried away by the current.
