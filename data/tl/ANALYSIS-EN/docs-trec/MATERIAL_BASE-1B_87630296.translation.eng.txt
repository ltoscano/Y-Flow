because of the persistence of the media President Aquino was forced to answer the question about his ex-girlfriend Shalani Soledad who is engaged to Pasig congressman Roman Romulo .
according to the president the two are a very good match .
the president prays for the two to be happy and have children that the country can depend on .
he already bought a gift but he's not sure if he'll be able to attend because of his busy schedule .
<no-speech>
so we hope that this will be what the union of Roman and Shalani will be able to achieve that they have found the right person in each other .
what is the message ?
so our emphasis is always been to strengthen a family .
we believe that a lot of the solutions to the problems that ill the country will be best addressed by a family that is strong united and is nurturing and caring for the children they bring into this world .
