(()) to everyone who's watching you .
how is your assessment of day one of back-to-school sir ?
<no-speech>
you know I am somewhat behind with the real events in Metro Manila and other parts of our country because I preferred to go here in Maguindanao to check what is really happening here .
so what I often got are reports and in general it's somehow all right there is the occasional problem in different schools but I am thankful to God that in general it looks like the first day of classes is okay .
yes .
-- Brother Luistro please excuse me but I know that last year you said that we don't have a shortage of classrooms .
something that is somewhat difficult to believe for many because when you see the average classroom size right -- the number of students per classroom exceeds fifty .
so what can you say to that secretary ?
<no-speech>
Jessica you know when you look at it overall because we we look at it in general for our country .
our classroom ratio now reaches up to thirty-eight or maybe forty-two right ?
our real problem is there in the cities wherein our residences are too congested especially when we have illegal informal settlers or relocatees that were not really planned right ?
but you know wherever in the N_C_R we can say that when we started we still had schools with three shifts .
but now I am sure that the worst is only two shifts or we have one left in the N_C_R with three shifts but only in grade four and we are building a classroom there right ?
our shortage that we noted in twenty ten of course every year we have new students .
we have classrooms that break down and of course we were also hit by Yolanda .
we have other problems there but what's important is that we were able to solve the shortage we were working for in twenty ten .
do our schools have new needs ?
more .
we also have programs for that .
yes .
Secretary Luistro the transferees from private schools that went to public school because of high tuition uh ?
that one you were able to input that because -- there seem to be schools whose number of enrollees blew up because many transferred .
maybe that's the one not included here in the input of our classroom ratio ?
<no-speech>
maybe these are the late enrollees but they were not %incomplete
