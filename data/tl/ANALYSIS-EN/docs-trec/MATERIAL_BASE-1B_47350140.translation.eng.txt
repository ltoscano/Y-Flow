many has taken notice now of the behavior of some City of Dreams casino and hotel representatives there at Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) terminal 3.
whenever they are at NAIA terminal 3, the hotel representatives seem to act as if they already bought the airport.
maybe if the CCTV cameras were reviewed at the said area, nothing else will be seen but them positioned at the arrival customs area elevator upon descending from the Immigration.
other hotel representatives complain, why are they only allowed until the lobby or even outside but those from City of Dreams have special treatment inside terminal 3.
they were totally standing there like they have the right to come up to arriving passengers.
why is this so AGM Vincente Guerzon!?
