Senator Sotto's mustache is thick Kennedy's daughter herself expressed that Senator Tito Sotto should ask for apology for his plagiarism of the speech of her father, former US senator Robert Kennedy.
but the comedian senator just laughed it off due to the logic that they had translated it to Tagalog.
you have really thick skin, senator, so shame does not affect you!
fuck, my friend, that is the second incident that Senator Sotto has been criticized with plagiarism but he even has the guts to brag!
your skin is really thick, Senator Sotto.
because of this, some groups have already filed an "ethics complaint" to the Senate to clarify if "sotto-copying" is really okay.
but Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile said, senators are "immune" regarding their speeches in senate.
so let us expect that they also have become "immune" to feeling shame!
let the whole world nickname some of our senators "sotto-copiers" because they do not know how to create their own sentences!
that, my friend, is how low the dignity of some of our honorables are.
