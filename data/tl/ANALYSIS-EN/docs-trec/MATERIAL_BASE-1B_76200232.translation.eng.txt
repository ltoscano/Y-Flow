Ramirez is a guest in PSA
June 28, 2016
after a long time, the incoming Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) chairman William "Butch" Ramirez will be a guest again to the weekly Philippine Sportswriter Association (PSA) Forum this morning in Shakey's Malate.
the Davao-based sports executive is expected to reveal his plans and programs in what can be called as his second term in the government sports agency.
Ramirez accepted the offer of President-elect Rodrigo Duterte last week to hold the PSC again, where he had been a chairman once (2005-2009).
the 10:30 a.m session can be heard in DZSR Sports Radio 918 and will be presented by San Miguel Corp., Accel, Shakey's and Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp.
