CBCP will open chaplaincy in Jordan by Noel Abuel August 16, 2016 the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) Episcopal Commission on Migrants and Itinerant People will open a chaplaincy in the Middle East particularly in Amman Jordan this year.
according to Balanga Bataan Bishop Ruperto Santos, chairman of the commission, this is the result of their meeting with Bishop Paul Hinder, the Vicar Apostolic of the Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Arabia last year related to the plea of many Filipinos to add Filipino priests there.
because of this, the bishop appealed to priests who want to join the apostolate and have a ministry in Amman Jordan who are ready to serve the overseas Filipino workers (OFW) who flock to the churches there.
