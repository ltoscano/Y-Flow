they are the kings of the sea in La Union .
the altitude of waves reaches up to fifteen feet .
especially every August until January .
and now Junvi and I will prove that we can be surfer dudes .
<no-speech>
Junvi let's go to the beach Junvi .
what can you say overreaction .
Aljay -- La Union -- finally we've arrived after five hours from Manila .
La Union -- La Union .
the surfing Mecca of the north .
everything is ready the surf boards are already there .
but where are the waves ?
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
what -- what wave do you have here ?
seems like our trip to come here was a waste .
what was our trip for if there are no waves I don't know .
that's why how what will we do here .
what a bummer .
<no-speech>
hey boys .
hey girl .
hey hi girl .
(()) .
beautiful .
your surfboard is very thin what -- what will we do with that ?
you know since there are no waves now don't worry .
yes why ?
if why -- why ?
there's always an option of course as a surfer and there are no waves it's slightly depressing right ?
I'm sad .
this thing called paddle board .
paddle board so here because -- (()) -- we'll board there .
is that what we'll ride ?
are you good at balancing ?
how do you reach that ?
(()) .
it's not everyday that the waves are good so today incidentally it's flat but I give them alternative assignment right instead of surfing we paddle boarded .
our surfing guru the celebrity guest tonight is the surfer chick slash survivor castaway Mara Yokohama .
<no-speech>
Mara why are you good at surfboarding ?
how long have you been surfboarding ?
surfboarding ?
yes I'm good at surfing because my dad built a surfing school here in La Union .
wow is that you ?
Yokohama -- Yokohama yes you know three weeks ago I bought that .
really ?
yes four .
you should have called me .
tires .
you should have called me so I could have treated you .
such a shame .
are you ready now ?
yes sure game of course before you are taught paddle boarding I will give you the basics in surfing too in case there are waves later like that .
there there is already a wave Junvi .
ah there is already one as far from there (()) our wave there there's a wave already .
so are we allowed there already ?
that is possible ?
that's already possible just like that ?
if it's close but you can stand too ?
ah sure sure sure .
sure sure .
so Mara -- yes (()) ready ?
ready .
it's survivor already .
let's go .
let's go .
let's go .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
so this is what you call a paddle board .
paddle board .
it's bigger than a normal surfboard because you need to balance more easily .
the bigger the board the easier it is to balance .
ah the bigger the board huh alright .
so are you game ?
harder we fall -- the bigger the board the harder you fall yes I'll give you the basics already .
<no-speech>
we were taught how to paddle or paddle the board using the hand .
you are standing just balance here by the center .
yes sorry sorry how is the paddling -- you cannot use your hands right ?
okay okay .
so here is your hand it's the one you'll use to paddle .
ah like an extension of the hand .
like that so like you are already kayaking just like yes right exactly standing so two sides should be should be while paddling ?
it's possible too possible too just one side just one side .
Mara also taught us a standing technique .
when you know how already we will race .
ah races -- ah race you know that's just like a bicycle right ?
it's the same principle of the bicycle you should just get your balance there as soon as you learn it and as long as you practice it you will get it too .
if considered what is called the paddle board is just simple .
you just need to stand and paddle on top of this big board .
<no-speech>
this sport started as an alternative to surfing .
<no-speech>
there are no waves but that does not mean we are not allowed to enjoy .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
looks like we bit more than we can chew here Jun .
just standing on the board is hard .
at first I taught them in the sand they were able to do it properly .
when it came to the sea they had some difficulty probably because of balance .
