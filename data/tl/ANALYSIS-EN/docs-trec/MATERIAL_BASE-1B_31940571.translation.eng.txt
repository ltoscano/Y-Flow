(()) aah aah the N is four because that number is -- an exponent with an exponent those were the exponents that are needed to be multiplied so twelve divided by three four .
so Nathan's answer is correct that n is equals to four .
I grew fond sir of math when I was in grade one because sir when I understood it I become quicker already sir in addition subtraction and the others as well sir .
that was when I understood that I have something to show when it comes to math .

he is Nathan Arthur Banatao grade six student of U_P Integrated School he is one of the leading students in Professor Solsa's math class .
compared to other students he gets higher scores .
and as I've said earlier he is one of the students that could answer correctly and fast .
he's a quick thinker .
if he will be compared in his level now he is more advanced .
<no-speech>
Nathan has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or A_D_H_D there are instances where he has difficulty concentrating in his studies and becomes really active .
that is why he regularly takes medicines during class .
it increases my focus so that I am not like -- there are times when I am not able to drink my medicines I often stare at nothing and randomly stands .
<no-speech>
oh yes Nathan .
A_D_H_D is a condition wherein it is difficult for a child to focus his attention on one thing .
difficult very very difficult because of that .
it's high according to his test results he has high impulsivity .
that means that he acts without thinking .
but on the other hand you can be very generous he is very loving to his siblings he is wise and not pretentious -- he's a cowboy .

Tom created a system in his house .
<no-speech>
so here's the checklist that we use every morning .
<no-speech>
actually this should be for Nathan only .
this is Nathan's only but because there are four of them siblings that are already studying so all of them each have their own .
so first of all here because it's difficult to wake Nathan up and uh also what I use here for motivation is play time computer time .
I learned this from the parenting seminars in A_D_H_D that said it should be structured because the minds of children with A_D_H_D tend to wander there needs to be something that he sees that will guide him so I will start with this .
we are here in our house and I will now show you my medals .
this my first this medal .
this one is grade three .
this is gold in MTAP this is (()) along with my other classmates here .
we won gold .
and this second one was in Singapore .
I got the gold .
uh it's like this shows the highest .
this next one was in India uh that -- International Math and Science Olympiad .
I only got the bronze .
<no-speech>
Nathan already has nine medals .
Nathan's dad finished in Computer Engineering that's why he serves as his son's personal math teacher .
but Tom thinks his son is better than him .
whatever those principles are he know why he's doing them .
often we don't -- uh -- uh -- agree .
it's okay with me that he's usually right and I'm wrong .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
now I'm now going to my training in (()) near Arellano .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
Nathan's training is every Saturday .
