no rest.
no rest.
(Jn. 5:1-16)
it's important to rest
if we have a lot of work and many things to do, we will get tired.
we need to rest.
if we think too much, we will get tired.
we need to rest.
when we have too many problems and get burdened in life, we get tired.
we need to rest.
the body gets tired, the mind gets tired, the heart gets tired.
in our tiredness, we must rest.
the Lord knows this that is why he commanded to have a day of rest.
this is very known to the Israelite.
because of this they became strict and should be followed.
they even gave laws for this to be followed.
but there is still much more higher and important than resting.
this is to help those who are in need.
for Jesus, to help others and those who are in need especially the poor and voiceless in the community is much more important than rest.
being a Christian is 24/7.
working the whole day is not an excuse so we could skip praying.
being busy the whole week is not an excuse for us not to go to church every Sunday.
we having problems is not an excuse for us to turn our backs on other people.
when we get tired, we should rest.
but tiredness should not stop us from doing good.
