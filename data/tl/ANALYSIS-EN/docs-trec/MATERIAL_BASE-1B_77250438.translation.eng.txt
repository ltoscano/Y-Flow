yes Mariz .
rain or shine is the current scene here at Loyola memorial park at Marikina but plenty of our fellow countrymen came here to visit the grave of their loved ones who passed away .
Mariz included in the people buried here is master rapper Francis Magalona who was visited by some of his fans .
also laid to rest here is the actor Jay Ilagan and even the veteran actress Nida Blanca .
vehicles here can enter and people said that even on November one vehicles are allowed to enter .
here is our interview .
but because on Monday there are classes it is unsure if tomorrow so .
<no-speech>
Mariz arriving here also is D_I_L_G secretary Mel Senin Sarmiento .
he went around in a surprise to observe the preparation of the cemeteries .
so far the preparation he saw was all right .
here is his statement .
surprise I'm really very used to this activity when I was mayor and I always preferred to check the surprise and look at the it's difficult if we will say .
meanwhile Mariz cleaners and groomers of tombstones are the majority of those in Arkong Bato Public Cemetery in Valenzuela City it is in one the cemetery is five hectares and all of the graves are apartment type .
already painted white because the city hall is supposedly the one that painted .
there are already police assigned there .
four portalets are placed that can be used by the people who are expected to arrive later at night up to tomorrow .
some of those G_M_A News talked to said that they already visited the tombs of their loved ones today to avoid the many people tomorrow .
it is more solemn if there are fewer people .
others have relatives they will visit in other cemeteries so they went here first .
here are their statements .
<no-speech>
because when there are many people and and we visit four dead in separate cemeteries .
I do not want to go together with many people .
and then tomorrow I still have to go to Holy Cross .
<no-speech>
Mariz here in Loyola Memorial Park in Marikina there is no -- untoward incident noted by the authorities .
earlier Secretary Sarmiento also saw confiscated lighters but the sharp objects and other -- illegal objects there are still no -- confiscated here inside the cemetery Mariz .
thank you very much %incomplete
