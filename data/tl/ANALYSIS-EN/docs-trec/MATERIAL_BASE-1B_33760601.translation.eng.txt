the authority also monitors the level of water of the dam in the country especially now that thunderstorm Buchoy has already entered the country .
Angat Dam the primary source of water in Manila is still far from overflowing and can still catch water regardless of strong rain .
from Bulacan reporting on the spot Dante Perello .
Dante ?
<no-speech>
yes Raffy .
the water of Angat Dam here in Bulacan remains on normal level .
<no-speech>
in the last record of Napocor as of ten in the morning water elevation is at an estimate of one hundred eighty-nine point ninety-six meters this is far from the spilling level which is two hundred seven meters and two hundred ten meters critical level .
that's why Angat Dam doesn't need to clear water actually it can still catch plenty of rain .
it's slowly reducing .
even there is we already have experienced rain not that much to rise .
what have made it to rise higher is the simultaneous rain which is generating a bad weather similar to a typhoon the Angat Dam is set to undergo a rehabilitation forty-three years past after it was built on the last seventies decade the approved fund of the Department of Budget and Management is point seven billion pesos through the mandate of President Noynoy Aquino .
the bidding of the contractors will be on the coming month .
and the project is expected to start on April next year and will be finished on the year twenty sixteen the slopes of the dam will be lessened because it is too steep and will add a spill way .
M_W_S_S had assured that the supply of water in Metro Manila which is taken here will not be affected while the rehabilitation is being done .
the three year project is a result of six month study and examination on the structural integrity of the dam .
because according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology or PHIVOLCS the dam is on the West Marikina Fault Line and can last a seven point two magnitude earthquake .
they have also discovered now that it has a splay or root under the main dike of Angat itself .
but there is nothing to be worried about .
because the materials used in Angat Dam does not easily break or crumble due to the movement of the land .
<no-speech>
PHIVOLCS also clarified that the dam has no clefts similar to what is reported .
the PHIVOLCS has been saying that connected to -- of the West Valley fault but this is far from the two hundred meters there on the dike .
so still until now %incomplete
so no -- this will not be affected if there would be a repeat of that seven point two earthquake .
<no-speech>
Raffy the unstoppable illegal logging and mining around Angat Dam Watershed is compromising the dam according to the M_W_S_S .
that is the hot new from here at Angat Dam .
