before the launch of donating the 'Alpabasa sets', there were 100 kinder and 100 grade 1 teachers that underwent training workshop to learn how to use 'Alpabasa sets' which they will use as their new teaching styles in their schools.
the 'Learning Lion Alpabasa tools' is an innovative game-based early reading program that will give joy and give knowledge to students through what they want to do most, especially children who loves playing.
every school will receive 'Alpabasa sets' (Kinder and Grade 1), 45 workbooks, 15 books, teachers' Kit, Poster, QC Childrens' Code Primer and Child-friendly QC Primer.
Learning Lion aims to share the project to other schools in the whole country thru giving free workshops and teaching tools that students need.
the 'Alpabasa series', aside from having a series of books, games, flash cards, worksheets, and original songs that can be used daily, is a big help to kinder and grade 1 pupils' reading of Filipino words at a young age.
