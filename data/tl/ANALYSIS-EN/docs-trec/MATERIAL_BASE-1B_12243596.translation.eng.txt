the term 'national athletes' should encompass all athletes including those who are differently-abled, as they undoubtedly deserve bigger incentives and benefits," said Angara, author and sponsor of Republic Act 10699.
Medina, 46-year-old flag bearer of the country in Games, is the second to win the Paralympic medal for the Philippines, after powerlifter, Adeline Dumapong who won bronze last 2000 in Sydney.
