Pacquiao also has a reward for Hidilyn by Boyet Jadulco August 10, 2016 weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz may have failed to nab a gold medal in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, but boxing icon and senator Manny Pacquiao is still ready to give a cash reward to the Zamboanga City athlete.
earlier Pacquiao promised to give five million pesos to any Filipino athlete who will bring home a gold medal in the Rio Olympics. Pacquiao almost ate his promise when he talked to Diaz and fit the silver medal from carrying 200 kilograms in the women's 53-kg category of weightlifting.
she is also the first Filipina and Mindanao native to get a medal in the Olympics.
Diaz will not go home empty-handed from Pacquiao because he will give even a little from his own pocket.
"let us not announce it," Pacman requested about how much he will give Diaz.
together with this, Senate Minority Leader Ralph Recto ensured that Diaz will still get the five million peso incentive under the National Athletes and Coaches Benefits and Incentives law or Republic Act 10699 even if there are still no implementing rules and regulations (IRR).
"even with no IRR, that is automatic, as written in the law," said Recto despite doubting if the incentive is tax-free.
"first and foremost, her five-million peso prize should be tax-free. the half that will go to the coach should also be tax-free," stressed the senator.
