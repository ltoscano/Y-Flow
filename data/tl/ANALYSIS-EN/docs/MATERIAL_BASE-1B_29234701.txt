<2>	July 28, 2016	July 28, 2016
<3>	Biglang umarangkada sa PSL ang F2 Logistics team.	the F2 Logistics team instantly accelerated through the PSL.
<4>	Bago lang ang kumpanyang ito sa mundo ng sports pero malakas na agad ang impact nila.	this company is new to the world of sports but immediately their impact is strong.
<5>	Yan ay dahil na rin sa nasa line-up nila ang mga sikat na players ng DLSU Lady Spikers na nag-champion lang kamakailan sa UAAP tulad nina Mika Reyes, Ara Galang, Kim Kianna Dy, at Kim Fajardo.	that is because the famous players of the DLSU Lady Spikers who were recent champions in the UAAP like Mika Reyes, Ara Galang, Kim Kianna Dy, and Kim Fajardo are in their lineup.
<6>	Pag nanonood kami ng PSL, kapansin-pansin talaga ang pagdagsa ng mga fans ng F2 at sila ang pumupuno sa San Juan Arena.	when we watch the PSL, the rush of F2 fans is really noticeable and they fill up the San Juan Arena.
<7>	May mga fans rin ang ibang teams tulad ng RC Cola pero kakaiba ang suportang ibinibigay ng mga La Salle fanatic sa F2.	other teams like RC Cola also have fans but the support given by La Salle fanatics of F2 is really different.
<8>	Kaya naman hanggang ngayon, hayan at wala pang talo ang F2 team sa PSL.	which is why up to now, like that, the F2 team still has no losses in the PSL.
<9>	And I am sure na tuwang-tuwa ang management ng F2 sa nakukuha nilang popularidad.	and I am sure the management of F2 is really happy with the popularity they gain.
<10>	***Iniakyat na agad sa DLSU Team A ang ex-NU junior standout na si Justin Baltazar.	- ex-NU junior standout Justin Baltazar is immediately promoted to DLSU Team A.
<11>	Na-injury sa ACL si Jiboy Gob kaya kailaÂ­ngan siyang palitan din agad sa lineup.	Jiboy Gob was injured in the ACL so he needed to be quickly replaced in the lineup.
<12>	Kaya mula Team B ay in-elevate na si Baltazar na last year ay siyang nagdala sa NU Bullpups na nag-champion sa UAAP junior division.	so from Team B Baltazar who carried the NU Bullpups who became champions of the UAAP junior division was elevated.
<13>	***Iisang player agent ang may hawak sa dalawang PBA players.	- a single player agent handles the two PBA players.
<14>	Pero balak niyang pagpalitin ng teams ang dalawang ito.	but he plans to switch the teams of these two.
<15>	Yan ay kung papayag ang teams na may hawak sa dalawang players na sina N at J.	that is if the teams handling the two players N and J will allow it.
<16>	Hindi raw kasi masyadong nagagamit si N sa team niya ngayon.	because supposedly N is currently not used much in his team.
<17>	***Maka-isa o dalawang talo pa ay on the way out na ang import ng isang sikat na PBA team.	- one or two more losses and the import of a famous PBA team is on the way out.
<18>	Feeling ng management, hindi sila magtsa-champion kung siya ang import nila.	the management feels, they do not become champions if he is their import.
