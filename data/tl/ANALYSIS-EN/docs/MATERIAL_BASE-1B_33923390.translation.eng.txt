top caliber athletes will be sieved by Ramil Cruz
December 15, 2016
the 60th edition of National Games in the year 2017 is coming, but you can only count with your fingers its amazing products, like Asia's fastest woman, Lydia de Vega-Mercado, former Southeast Asian Games most outstanding athlete swimmer, Eric Buhain, former national 400meter/100meter hurdles record holder, Reynato Unso, and ex-SEAG long jump queen, Elma Muros-Posadas.
it was still in the decade of 70s when the names of the four athletes emerged; and up until the last edition of Games in Albay this year, they remain to be standouts in the yearly sports fest.
no one got to follow their steps.
Philippine Sports Commission will interfere with the competition for the student-athletes of region 18 of the country to discover the likes of the caliber of de Vega-Mercado, Buhain, Muros-Posadas, and Unso.
National Games is a grassroots sports program.
but why aren't there newly-developed world class athletes like Lydia, Eric, Unso, and Elma in the past editions?
"so we in the PSC, being part of the management of Games, will revisit what should be done to Games," statement of PSC Chair, Butch Ramirez, the other day.
one of Ramirez's wishes is to bring back the Games to PSC.
