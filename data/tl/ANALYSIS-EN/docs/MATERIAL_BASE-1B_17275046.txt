<1>	PAUMANHIN NG PH NAVY PAUMANHIN o “Letter of Apology” ang ipinadala ng Philippine Navy kaugnay ng hindi magandang karanasan natin at marami pang iba sa “convoy” ng Navy at Philippine Marines kamakailan sa kahabaan ng SCTex papasok ng Subic Bay Freeport.	apology of the PH navy or a "letter of apology" was sent by the Philippine Navy to us and to many others in relation to our unpleasant experience on the convoy of the Navy and the Philippine Marines recently at the length of SCTex entering the Subic Bay Freeport.
<2>	Ito Ang Totoo: ayon kay LCdr. Marineth R. Domingo, director ng Naval Public Affairs Office (NPAO), ang Navy sa ilalim ni Vice Admiral Jesus C. Millan, flag officer in command, ay nagpapasalamat sa isinulat natin dito sa ating kolum na nagpaabot sa kanilang atensyon ng insidente.	this is the truth: according to Lieutenant Commander Marineth R. Ocampo, Director of the Naval Public Affairs Office (NPAO), the Navy is under Vice Admiral Jesus C. Millan, flag officer command, is thanking for what we have written in our column which sent an attention to them on the incident.
<3>	Magsasagawa aniya ng kaukulang hakbang ng pagtutuwid, indoktrinasyon at “briefings” kaugnay ng inasal ng ilang Navy at Marine personnel na pinuna nga natin.	according to her, an appropriate step of making it right, indoctrination and briefing will be conducted in relation to the conduct of some Navy and Marine personnel which we criticized.
<4>	Naniniwala naman tayo, gaya ng sinabi natin sa artikulo, na ang inasal ng iilan sa naturang “convoy” ay hindi sumasalamin sa pangkalatan ng Ph Navy at Marines.	we believe, similar to what we have said in the article, that the conduct of the said convoy has not mirrored the whole of the Philippine Navy and Marines.
<5>	Gayunman, marapat rin na ito ay hindi palampasin upang hindi naman makasira sa napakalaki nang pagsulong ng ating Navy at Marines bilang mga indibidwal at organisasyon.	nevertheless, it is better not to let this pass so that it will not destroy the huge advancement of our Navy and Marines as individuals and organization.
<6>	Samantala, ang Ph Navy ay ginawaran ng “Family Values Award” ng The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints nitong nakaraang linggo dahil sa mga programa at panuntunan nitong nagbibigay-halaga sa pamilya.	meanwhile, the Philippine Navy is awarded with Family Values Award of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints last week because of the programs and regulations that give value to the family.
<7>	Ito’y pagpapakita na ang hanay ng Ph Navy at Marines at bilang organisasyon, ay tunay na sumusulong.	this is showing that the ranks of the Philippine Navy and Marines and as an organization is truly advancing.
<8>	Mabuhay po kayo!	long live!
