<1>	Halaga ng CPRBy Zaldy Perez July 6, 2016 Sa wala ng panahong pagkamatay ni Blackwater player Gilbert Bulawan, lalong nabigyang-diin ang kahalagahan na matuto ng basic Cardio pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) kahit ang pangkaraniwang tao.	Price of CPRBy Zaldy Perez July 6, 2016 The untimely death of Blackwater player Gilbert Bulawan, has put emphasis to the importance of learning basic Cardio pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) even by ordinary people.
<2>	Mahalaga ang CPR dahil ang sinumang magkaroon ng sudden cardiac arrest at mabigyan nito ay malaki ang tsansa na revive ang pasyente.	CPR is important because to anyone who have a sudden cardiac arrest and have this delivered to them would increase the chance to revive the patient.
<3>	Ayon sa mga eksperto mahalaga ang oras sa isang tinamaan ng cardiac arrest. Zero to 6 minutes matatawag itong clinical death at reversible kung mabibigyan kaagad ng CPR. Ngayon kung tumagal pa ng 6-10 o mahi­git pa sa 10 minuto, ito ang tinatawag na biological death o hindi na maiiwasan na magkaroon ng brain damage, ma-comatose ang biktima o mauwi sa kamatayan.	According to experts, time is of importance to someone hit by cardiac arrest. Zero to 6 minutes is called clinical death and is reversible if provided immediately with CPR. if it lasted for 6-10 or more than 10 minutes, this is called biological death or may cause unavoidable brain damage, comatose patient, or end in death.
<4>	Hindi naman na siguro kaila sa ating lahat ang nangyari kay Samboy ‘Skywalker’ Lim na inatake habang naglalaro kasama ang iba pang da­ting PBA players.	it is common knowledge to all of us the experience of Samboy "Skywalker" Lim whose gone into cardiac arrest while playing with other former PBA players.
<5>	Dahil wala isa man sa kanyang mga kasama na nakaka-intindi kung paano isagawa ang CPR sa isang inaatake ay na-coma si Samboy.	because no one around him at that time understood how to perform a CPR to a cardiac arrest patient, Samboy slip into coma.
<6>	Ang pangyayari kay Lim ang nagtulak kay da­ting Pampanga 1st District Rep. at Rain or Shine coach Yeng Guiao, na magpasa ng batas na nag-aatas sa mga private at public shools na isailalim sa Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation Training ang mga estudyante bago sila mag- graduate.	what happened to Lim pushed former Pampanga 1st District Representative and Rain or Shine coach Yeng Guiao, pass a law mandating private and public schools have their students undergo Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation Training before they graduate.
<7>	Nakapasa na ang Samboy Lim bill sa kongreso at nakabimbin sa ngayon sa senado.	The Samboy Lim bill passed the Congress and is pending now at the senate.
<8>	Nag-collapse si Bulawan, 29 years old habang nag-eensayo noong Linggo, Hulyo 3, katabi ang teammate na si Reil Cervantes.	Bulawan collapsed, 29 years old, while practicing last Sunday, July 3, beside teammate Reil Cervantes.
<9>	Ang isa pang player na inatake rin habang nag­lalaro at namatay ay si Carl Jimwell CJ Sevillon ng Jose Rizal College Jr. team. Nag-collapse si Sevillon matapos na mag-time -out ang kanilang coach sa kanilang laban sa De La Salle Zobel sa Fil Oil league noong Mayo 2015.	Another player whose gone into cardiac arrest while playing and died was Carl Jimwell CJ Sevillon of Jose Rizal College Junior team. Sevillon collapsed after their coach called a time-out during their battle against De La Salle Zobelle at the Fil Oil league last May 2015.
<10>	Ilan lamang ito sa siguro’y marami pang insidente na nangyari dito sa Pilipinas na kung na-aplayan kaagad ng CPR ay maaring hindi na- co­matose at nabuhay pa.	these are just few of maybe many incidents that happened here in the Philippines in which if CPR was immediately applied may not be comatose and lived.
