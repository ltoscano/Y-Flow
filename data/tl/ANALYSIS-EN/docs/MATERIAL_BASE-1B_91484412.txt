<3>	Personal nating natunghayan ang umalog na tuhod ng Amerikano nang matikman nito ang malulutong na suntok ni Pacquiao.	we personally witnessed how the knees of the American was shaken when he tasted the crispy punches of Pacquiao.
<4>	MASWERTE SI ALGIERI	Algieri is fortunate!
<5>	Maraming pagkakataon si Pacquiao para patumbahin ang Kano, pero dahil siguro sa pagiging malapit nito sa Diyos ay mukhang nabawasan na ang bangis nito.	Pacquiao has many chances to topple down the American but because of his closeness to God, his ruthlessness is lessened.
<6>	Usapang barbero lang… Napakasuwerte ni Algieri dahil nabigyan siya ng pagkakataon na makasuntok sa isang Congressman ng Pilipinas.	just a talk of the town. Algieri is fortunate because he was given a chance to punch a congressman of the Philippines.

<11>	Sagot ni Algieri… “I would rather fight the old aggressive Pacquiao than the new smart fighting Pacquiao.”	Algieri answers, "I would rather fight the old aggressive Pacquiao than the new smart fighting Pacquiao."
<12>	Base sa bulong ni Algieri sa ULTIMATUM, mas mabilis daw talunin si Pacquiao noon kaysa ngayon dahil napakatalino raw nitong kalaban.	based on the whispers of Algieri to the Ultimatum, Pacquiao was easier to defeat before than now because he is a very smart opponent.
<13>	Talaga lang ha!	oh, really!
<14>	CHAMPION ANG PINOY	a Filipino is a champion
<15>	Kitang-kita ang galing ng Pinoy sa boksing na ipinamalas na naman ni Pacquiao pero ang tanong hanggang kelan?	the skill of a Filipino is clearly seen in boxing as shown by Pacquiao but the question is, until when?
<16>	Hanggang mapatumba si Mayweather?	until he can topple down Mayweather?
