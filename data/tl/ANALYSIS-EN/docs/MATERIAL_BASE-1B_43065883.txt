<4>	(17.365-25.560)	yung <hes> sinisi niya yung <hes> A_F_P sa hindi pagtugon sa kanilang panawagan na ma- -- ma- -- masaklolohan sila .	he is blaming the A_F_P for not responding to their plea for them -- to be -- saved .
<5>	(25.560-29.386)	kausapin natin ang <hes> spokesman ng A_F_P .	let us talk with the spokesman of A_F_P .
<6>	(29.386-33.390)	<hes> (()) Colonel Restituto Padilla Junior .	(()) Colonel Restituto Padilla Junior .
<7>	(33.390-34.381)	good morning colonel .	good morning colonel .
<8>	(34.381-37.700)	all talk all ready .	all talk all ready .

<10>	(42.659-64.090)	no'ng nakikinig ka do'n sa testimony ni <hes> director Napeñas sa anong naging reaksiyon mo at anong official na reaksiyon din ng Armed Forces of the Philippines sa pagsisisi niya sa A_F_P sa pag- -- sa di-umanong mga pagkukulang nito na laging di-umano naging dahilan ng pagkasawi ng kanilang mga tauhan ?	when you were listening at the testimony of director Napeñas what was your reaction and also the official reaction of the Armed Forces of the Philippines on him blaming the A_F_P on the -- about the alleged shortcomings that supposedly became the reason of the deaths of their people ?
<11>	(64.090-71.760)	<hes> very subjective po kasi ang kaniyang naging <hes> pahayag at <hes> 'yon lang ho kasi ay sa paniniwala niya .	his statement was very subjective and that was his conviction .
<12>	(71.760-83.350)	<hes> hindi naman ho kasi gano'n talaga ang aming <hes> nagiging pagtutulungan lalo na sa <no-speech> mga kagulu- -- oras ho ng kaguluhan lalo na ho diyan sa may Mindanao .	it's not really like that our cooperation especially in -- times of trouble especially there in Mindanao .
<13>	(83.350-95.600)	<hes> malaki po ang naidulot ng pagkakaroon niya ng pag- -- <hes> withhold ng information o yung pagtatago ng information na very selective po ang kaniyang pagtse- -- pagbibigay .	the cause was great with regards to his acquirement of-- withholding of information or hiding information where his -- imparting was very selective .
<14>	(95.600-102.083)	kaya ito po ang naging dahilan kaya medyo masama ho yata ang loob niya't hindi ho nakarating .	thus this became the reason why he felt bad and did not come .
<15>	(102.083-117.510)	hindi niya ho pala na ho naintindihan ang tunay na picture kung paano ho nagkaroon ng <hes> ganoong kaganapan dahil nailahad naman po namin na ng detalyado ang mga pangyayari no'ng araw na 'yon at hindi po kami nagkulang .	he also did not understand the real picture as to how that event came about because we have declared that the events on that day were detailed and we did not lack anything .
<16>	(117.510-126.760)	makikita naman po doon sa aming salaysay na umaga pa lang po alas sais pa lang eh nag-mobilize na po ang mga tropa .	it can be seen in our statement that even in the morning it was still six o'clock when the troops were already mobilized .
<17>	(126.760-139.117)	'yon eh kailan -- 'yon do'n sa pagdedetalye ninyo ano ba ang ina-asset n'yo na una hindi kayo binigyan ng <hes> fully information at <hes> ano ba ang mga naging desisyon n'yo ?	that is when -- there in in your detailing what were you assessing that at first you were not given fully information and what were your decisions ?
<18>	(139.117-155.570)	hindi ba kayo -- <hes> kayo ba'y sa tingin n'yo naging parang ura-urada yung <hes> paghingi ng saklolo o 'yan ba ay could have been done better <hes> and how could it -- ka- -- how could have it been done better ?	are you not -- do you think that you were hasty when you asked for rescue or could you have done better and how could it -- how could have it been done better ?
<19>	(155.570-165.575)	<hes> una po na isaad din po namin ang kahulugan sa amin ng <hes> ang ibig sabihin at kahulugan po ng koordinasyon -- word na coordination .	first we have also stated our definition of the meaning and definition of coordination -- the word coordination .
<20>	(165.575-174.895)	inilahad po namin 'yan sa aming presentasyon at para naman po magkaroon po ng basic plane of understanding kung ano talaga ang pagkakaintindi namin dito .	we have also divulged that in our presentation and to in order to have a basic plane of understanding on what we really discerned about this .
<21>	(174.895-184.260)	at nailagay namin doon na hindi naman ito basta-basta tawag lang ng ura-urada at ng ngayon lang na tapos na ang mga pangyayari .	and were able to include there that this is not simple and cannot be rushed and the events finished only now .
<22>	(184.260-191.340)	at yung <hes> mga request niya po hindi ho naging very specific <hes> no'ng mga circumstances na 'yon yung mga araw na 'yon .	and the his requests were not very specific on those circumstances on those days .
<23>	(191.340-199.655)	dahilan na rin ho siguro sa pressure na kaniyang <hes> nararamdaman galing sa kaniyang mga tropa do'n sa may area ng labanan .	maybe also due to pressure from his feelings from his troops there by the battle area .
<24>	(199.655-207.930)	sa amin po kasi madaming nagbukas yung naging insidente na nagkamali po na kung pag-uusapan po ay fire support .	many opened to us about the incident that there was a mistake that if it will be discussed it is fire support .
<25>	(207.930-219.780)	at yung mga lessons learned po na 'yon ay hindi po namin kinakalimutan at kinakailangang magdulot ng karagdagang improvement sa aming operasyon sa field .	and we will never forget those lessons learned and there needs to be additional improvement in our operation in the field .
<26>	(219.780-237.588)	kaya kami po ay very particular lalo na sa mga prog- -- pagkabi- -- pagbigay ng mga supporting fires pag ginagamit ang artillery at doon ho yata nagkaroon ng kontensyon ito <hes> si General Napeñas dahil sa kaniyang hinihinging fire support .	we are very particular especially about the -- -- giving of supporting fires if artillery is used and it is probably there that there is contention General Napeñas because of the fire support he is requesting .
<27>	(237.588-243.670)	ang problema ho may requirements po kasi <no-speech> bago ibigay ang fire support .	the problem is there are requirements before fire support is given .
<28>	(243.670-249.296)	at yung mga tinatanong yung kuro-kuro ng karamihan na tao bakit hindi ho kami nakapagpalipad ng eroplano .	and the questions the gossip from majority of the people is why we were not able to fly planes .
<29>	(249.296-252.250)	unang-una ho wala hong eroplano sa lugar .	first of all there is no plane in the area .
<30>	(252.250-255.527)	mayroon pong on-going operation sa Pagadian .	there is an on-going operation in Pagadian .
<31>	(255.527-256.037)	okay .	okay .

<35>	(267.288-279.970)	<hes> hindi na ho kasi gano'n kadami ang ating mga eroplano kaya't pina-prioritize po natin kung ano lang ang merong mga areas ng operasyon na may pangangailangan para sa mga ito at gano'n na nga po ang nangyari .	the number of our planes isn't that high so we prioritize what we have on areas of operation that have need for them and that is what happened .
<36>	(279.970-284.433)	<overlap> naka-standby doon <hes> na malapit na mga eroplano %incomplete	on standby there near the airplanes %incomplete
<37>	(284.433-289.839)	wala po tayong naka-standby doon na helicopter at <hes> gunship .	we don't have a helicopter and gunship on standby there .
<38>	(289.839-290.900)	gunships oo .	gunships yes .
<39>	(290.900-291.333)	opo .	yes .
<40>	(291.333-295.381)	kaya nga po't <hes> artillery support lang po ang available at tsaka armor assets .	so only artillery support and armor assets are available .
<41>	(295.381-299.090)	naibigay po ang armor assets as early as six six thirty .	the armor assets were given as early as six six thirty .
<42>	(299.090-299.990)	ready na po ito .	they're ready .
<43>	(299.990-312.580)	at nakarating sa area ito ng mga pasado alas-otso kasama na po yung mga tropa na nakaalam galing do'n sa division reconnaissance company na siyang naka-standby para sa mga pagka- -- pagkakataong ganito .	and they arrived in the area past eight o'clock together with the informed troops coming from the division reconnaissance company that is on standby for -- opportunities like this .
<44>	(312.580-325.380)	eh ano yung sinasabi ni Napeñas na -- sinasabi ni Napeñas na <hes> masama raw yung kanilang mga eksperyensiya with the Armed Forces of the Philippines in the past kaya hindi na raw sila nagtitiwala na ano ?	what is Napeñas saying that -- Napeñas is saying that their experiences with the Armed Forces of the Philippines in the past were not good so they no longer trust the uh ?
<45>	(325.380-345.738)	<hes> it will again po <hes> mister secretary ay very subjective dahil ang case po dito case proof of the footing po dito is madami naman po tayong nagiging <hes> operasyon lalo na do'n mga nakaraang araw at buwan na very successful ang aming pakikipag- -- <hes> tulungan sa Philippine National Police .	it will again mister secretary very subjective because the case here is case proof of the footing here we have many operations especially in the past days and months in which our -- are very successful cooperation with the Philippine National Police .
<46>	(345.738-365.931)	at katulad nga ho no'ng isang araw lang o no'ng <hes> tama ho no'ng isang araw lang may mga joint operations po tayo diyan sa Basilan na yung Abu Sayyaf group ay nakuha natin at <hes> sa Surigao at Agusan madami pong joint operations diyan na pinakikita na pag nagtutulungan magandang ho ang nagiging accomplishment .	and similar to the other day or in correct just the other day we had joint operations there in Basilan wherein we got the Abu Sayyaf group in Surigao and in Agusan there are many joint operations there showing that when there is cooperation the accomplishment is good .
<47>	(365.931-368.110)	nakakalikom po tayo ng mga armas .	we were able to collect weapons .
<48>	(368.110-373.689)	nahuhuli po natin ng <hes> dead or alive ang mga suspect na subject ng arrest warrant .	we captured dead or alive the suspects subjected to arrest warrants .
<49>	(373.689-380.100)	ito po ay pagtutulungan ng armed forces tsaka ng pulis so hindi po namin maintindihan .	this is a partnership of the armed forces and the police so we don't understand .
<50>	(380.100-396.809)	pero bagamat gano'n naman din po ang sinabi niya seryoso po kami na malaman kung ano yung mga issues and concerns <overlap> at <hes> alamin ang tunay na mga dulot o dulo ng kaniyang pagkakawalan ng tiwala .	but despite what he said we are serious about knowing what are the issues and concerns and finding out the real cause or causes of his loss of faith .
<51>	(396.809-398.887)	oo actually very important 'yan eh .	yes actually that's very important .
<52>	(398.887-408.540)	talagang kung mayroon man ano talagang open ang mind natin kasi siyempre yung mga iba gusto eh pagsabungin yung <hes> P_N_P at tsaka yung armed forces .	if there is really uh our mind is really open of course some want to make the P_N_P and the armed forces clash .
<53>	(408.540-432.557)	pero in the interests of peace and order and <hes> the hopes na magkaroon ng <hes> ka- -- kapayapaan at katatagan do'n sa rehiyon eh dapat eh ang maging frame of mind ay hindi yung naghahanap ka ng kung sino sisisihin kung papaano <hes> tayo matututo sa ano't hindi na mauulit yung ano kasi yung assumed na yung interoperability no'ng dalawa eh for for a very very long time .	but in the interests of peace and order and the hopes of having peace and stability there in the region the frame of mind needs to be not you're looking for someone to blame how we will learn from uh so it won't be repeated because the interoperability of the two is assured for for a very very long time .
<54>	(432.557-438.230)	<hes> we're supposed to have been operating together in many instances hindi ba ?	we're supposed to have been operating together in many instances right ?
<55>	(438.230-440.419)	that's -- that's true po mister secretary .	that's -- that's true mister secretary .
<56>	(440.419-444.788)	ang dami na pong pagkakataon at ang isa naman po lang ang bottom line dito .	there have been many opportunities and there is only one bottom line here .
<57>	(444.788-452.127)	ang <hes> matulungan po ang taong bayan at ma-assure ang kanilang safety lalo na sa mga panahong tulad nito .	that we help the people and assure their safety especially in times like this .
<58>	(452.127-462.660)	at ang interes naman natin is mahanap at ma-neutralize kung kinakailangan ang lahat ng masasamang loob na nagdudulot ng kaguluhan para naman sa kapakanan ng lahat .	and our interest is to find and neutralize if needed all the evil doers that cause conflict for the good of all .
<59>	(462.660-478.540)	'yon naman po lang talaga ang dapat namin <hes> pinagtutuunan ng pansin at madaming pagkakataon na maayos naman kaya't patuloy kami na nakikipag-usap sa Philippine National Police at wala hong katotohanan na nag-aaway kami .	that is what we really need to focus our attention on and there are many opportunities that it is doing well so we continue to talk with the Philippine National Police and there is no truth that we are fighting .
<60>	(478.540-485.950)	maganda po ang coordination namin lalo na po sa mga dalawang headquarters na mga kinakailangang pag-usapan ay policy changes .	our coordination is good especially with the two headquarters wherein policy changes need to be discussed .
<61>	(485.950-502.178)	alam mo colonel isa sa mga paulit-ulit kong binabanggit dito sa station sa radyo 'no isa sa pinakaimportanteng leksiyon na natutunan ng mga Amerikano yung intelligence community nila do'n sa nine eleven ay yung talagang kinakailangang they have to really share .	you know colonel one of the things I keep on mentioning here in the radio station is that one of the most important lessons learned by the Americans their intelligence community there from nine eleven is that they really they have to really share .
<62>	(502.178-507.849)	kasi talagang alam naman natin sa intelligence eh kaniya -- kanya-kanyang ano 'yan eh kanya-kanyang taguan 'yan eh .	because we really know that in intelligence it's your own -- it's your own -- it's your own safekeeping .
<63>	(507.849-515.694)	'yon bang ayaw natin i-share do'n sa kabila sa ibang mga ahensiya <hes> dahil sa well <hes> hopefully a- -- accomplishment 'no ?	like we don't want to share there with other agencies because well hopefully an accomplishment right ?
<64>	(515.694-528.461)	'yon bang <hes> is a feather in your cap pero pag hindi natin nagawa <hes> na-solve yung problemang iyan palagay ko'y <hes> <hes> magkakaroon ng mga -- mabubulaga na naman tayo <hes> dito sa mga operation natin .	like it is is a feather in your cap but if we're not able to do it solve that problem I think there will be -- we will be shocked here in our operations .
<65>	(528.461-536.530)	'yon ang -- yung ang isa sa <hes> totoo po 'yan at <hes> 'yon nga po isa rin po 'yan sa aming <hes> napag-usapan .	that is -- that is one of the that is true that is also one of the things we talked about .
<66>	(536.530-555.857)	dahil sa mga panahong ito lalo na ho sa bilis ng takbo ng impormasyon hindi lang ho sa sa technology kundi sa iba pang bagay hindi po natin ma-afford na hindi mag-usap at magtulungan dahil kung hindi mauunahan lagi tayo ng <hes> mga nais maghasik ng kaguluhan .	because in times like this especially with the speed information transfers not just in technology but in other areas too we cannot afford not to discuss and cooperate because if not we will be left behind by those who want to cause trouble .
<67>	(555.857-556.364)	okay .	okay .
<68>	(556.364-557.843)	thank you very much <hes> colonel .	thank you very much colonel .
