August 16, 2016
Ibaan, Batangas, August 16 (PIA) - around 32 swine raisers have benefited from the Organic Pig raising seminar conducted by the local government last August 9 which is upheld in partnership with the Municipal Agriculture Office and International Training Center for Pig Husbandry (ITCPH).
Ibaan Mayor Juan Toreja said that the training has an objective to be able to give knowledge and widen the skills in raising swine in a natural way.
"aside from raising swine, I want to give assertion on the importance of recycling the manure of the pigs to avoid this in affecting our surroundings especially that this is one of the contributors of pollution," Toreja added.
Mrs. Amy Eguia from the Career Development and Management Services of the ITCPH discussed the different breeds of native pigs such as Meishan, Landrace, Berkshire and Pietrain as well as those needed to be considered in raising pigs such as having a forage area for feeding and concoction every time the pig eats.
some of the pointers given in making a proper shelter for the pigs is the use of Nipa palm as ceiling, creating spaces between the cogon or cogon grass for a good ventilation; putting a one-meter rice husks or sawdust as bed materials and container or receptacle of water for drinking near the water source.
also explained by Mrs.
Jenny Hornilla that a natural pig medication is not used with any medicine or antibiotics but rather herbal medicines are applied.
some of the illness of the pigs that can be treated using herbal are scours or diarrhea, internal parasites, dehydration caused by loose bowl movement and shingles or other foot diseases.
Hornilla is reminding that in case the treatment of herbal medicines are not going to be effective to the pet pigs, veterinarians can be consulted.
