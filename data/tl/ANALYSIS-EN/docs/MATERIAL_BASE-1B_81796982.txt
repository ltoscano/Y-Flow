<1>	Ako ay Musang na 'non-combatant'	I am a Musang that is 'non-combatant'
<2>	Kadete pa lamang ako sa PMA, pangarap ko nang maging Scout Ranger.	even when I was still a cadet in the PMA, it was already my dream to become a scout ranger.
<3>	Bata pa lang ako, naririnig ko na ang mga kahanga-hangang kagalingan sa pakikidigma ng mga 'Iring' o 'Musang'.	even when I was just a kid, I had already heard about the amazing feats in fighting of the "Iring" or "Musang".
<4>	Naalala ko pa na kinakatakutan sila ng mga bandidong NPA na naglipana sa aming probinsya.	I still remember that they were feared by the bandit NPA that were widespread in our province.
<5>	Panay SR tab at patch ang aking display sa aking locker noon.	the display in my locker back then were all SR tabs and patches.
<6>	Kapag mag-tour ako dahil sa pagpapasaway, isinisigaw ko na lang pagkatapos ng "Ranger!" bilang pampa-high morale sa sarili.	when I was on tour because of disobedience, I just shouted "ranger!" after to increase my morale.
<7>	Karagdagan pa nyan, mataas ang pagtingin namin sa mga Tactical Officers na Scout Rangers.	in addition to that, we thought highly of scout rangers that were tactical officers.
<8>	Nagkataon naman na Tac-o ko sa Hawk Company noon si Cpt Dinoh Dolina ng PMA Class of 1985, isa sa mga nakapagtapos ng US Ranger Course.	incidentally my tac-o at Hawk company back then was Captain Dinoh Dolina of PMA class of 1985, one of those who finished the US ranger course.
<9>	Lalong naging desidido ako noong 1993, nang bumisita sa PMA ang 'Living Legend' ng First Scout Ranger Regiment, si Colonel Julius Javier.	I became more convinced in 1993, after 'living legend' First Scout Ranger Regiment Colonel Julius Javier visited the PMA.
<10>	Napakarami ng kwento ang naririnig namin tungkol sa kanyang combat accomplishments noon.	numerous were the stories we heard about his combat accomplishments back then.
<11>	Bayani ang tingin namin sa kanya.	we see him as a hero.
<12>	Kaya naman, noong 1994 na kung kailan kami ay mga 'young and dashing' 2nd Lts, isa lang ang aking gustong yunit nang pinaglista kami sa Army headquarters ng aming priority unit assignment.	so, in 1994 when we were 'young and dashing' 2nd lieutenants, there was only one unit I wanted when we were to register our priority unit assignment in the army headquarters.
<13>	Maalala ko ang 13 na mga yunit ang aming pagpilian na mapuntahan: Eight (8) Infantry Divisions, First Scout Ranger Regiment, Special Forces (Airborne) at Light Armor Brigade.	I remember we could choose from 13 units to be assigned to: eight (8) infantry divisions, first scout ranger regiment, special forces (airborne) and light armor brigade.
<14>	Sa sistemang prioritization, isulat mo ayon sa pagkasunod-sunod ang gustong mapuntahang yunit.	in the priority system, write your order of units you want to go to.
<15>	Halimbawa kung pinakagusto ay FSRR, ilagay ito sa number 1, and so forth.	for example if the most desired is FSRR, place it on number 1, and so forth.
<16>	Syempre, ang gusto ko ay Scout Ranger unit at hindi lamang magiging Scout Ranger graduate.	of course, what I wanted is scout ranger unit and not just become a scout ranger graduate.
<17>	Magkaiba yon eh.	those are different.
<18>	Dahil nga sa die hard Scout Ranger ako, sinubukan kong magpasaway.	because I was a die-hard scout ranger, I tried to be disobedient.
<19>	Ito ang aking nilagay sa aking papel na ipinasa:	this is what I placed in my paper that I passed:
<20>	Name: 2nd Lt Harold M Cabunoc (Inf) PA	name: 2nd Lieutenant Harold M Cabunoc (Inf) PA
<21>	Order of Priority:	order of priority:
<22>	1. First Scout Ranger Regiment	1. first scout ranger regiment
<23>	2. First Scout Ranger Regiment	2. first scout ranger regiment
<24>	3. First Scout Ranger Regiment	3. first scout ranger regiment

<33>	12. First Scout Ranger Regiment	12. first scout ranger regiment
<34>	13. First Scout Ranger Regiment	13. first scout ranger regiment
<35>	At may dinagdag pa akong pa-cute: "Rangers Lead the Way!"	and I added for cuteness: "rangers lead the way!"
<36>	Mismong ang legendary Scout Ranger warrior na si Col Julius L Javier ang pumili ng mga opisyal mula doon sa sobra 40 na nag-volunteer na sumanib sa FSRR na kanyang pinamunuan.	legendary scout ranger warrior Colonel Julius L Javier himself chose the officials there from the more than 40 who volunteered to join the FSRR in his leadership.
<37>	Katatapos namin sa Scout Ranger Orientation Course sa FSRR noon nang sya mismo ang nagbasa sa mga napili nyang maging Musang.	we had just finished our scout ranger orientation course in the FSRR when he himself read his choices to become Musang.
<38>	Grabe ang dasal ko na masama ang aking pangalan nang paisa-isa nyang tinawag ang mga pangalan.	intense was my prayer for my name to be included when he read the names one by one.
<39>	"Ranger Cabasan.	"Ranger Cabasan.
<40>	Ranger Criste.	Ranger Criste.
<41>	Ranger Derilo.	Ranger Derilo.
<42>	Ranger Pagayon.	Ranger Pagayon.
<43>	Ranger Almodovar."	Ranger Almodovar."
<44>	Parang pakonti-konti na lang natira sa slot wala pa rin ang pangalan ko.	the remaining slots seemed to be diminishing but my name was still missing.
<45>	"At.... kasama si Ranger Cabunoc!"	"and... including Ranger Cabunoc!"
<46>	Syempre parang success ako don.	of course it was like I was successful there.
<47>	Kasama ako sa maging Musang!	I am included in those to become Musang!
<48>	Kasama sa kinuha ay ang PMA Class 94 Salutatorian at "Army Class Marcher" na si Manny Cabasan at ako na nagtapos bilang pinakahuli o 'Class Goat'.	included in the selection were PMA class 94 salutatorian and "army class marcher" Manny Cabasan and I who finished last or "class goat".
<49>	Ewan kung na-challenge sa aking pagiging mapangahas na pasaway, isa ako sa handpicked na magiging kasapi sa elite unit ng mga mandirigma.	I don't know if challenged by my bold disobedience, I was one of the handpicked to become part of the elite unit of fighters.
<50>	By the way, parehas kaming Class Goat ni idol Col. Julius Javier.	by the way, idol Colonel Julius Javier and I were both class goats.
<51>	Meron ding apat na mula sa Officer Candidate School Class 11-94 ang pinili.	there were also four from the officer candidate school class 11-94 chosen.
<52>	Ito ay sina Jun Claros, Jake Paler, Jun Gaminde at DJ De Joya.	these are Jun Claros, Jake Paler, Jun Gaminde and DJ De Joya.
<53>	Labing lima kaming kinuha ng FSRR:	fifteen of us were taken in by FSRR:
<54>	1\. 2nd Lt Clifford Cordova	1. 2nd Lieutenant Clifford Cordova
<55>	2\. 2nd Lt Harold Cabunoc	2. 2nd Lieutenant Harold Cabunoc

<69>	Agawan ng assignment	competing for assignment
<70>	Nang pinag-report kami sa FSRR noong January 1995, sinigurado kong dumating na mas maaga sa termination.	when we were asked to report to FSRR on January 1995, I made sure to arrive earlier than termination.
<71>	January 3 pa lang, nasa FSRR headquarters na ako sa Fort Bonifacio.	I was already in the FSRR headquarters in Fort Bonifacio by January 3.
<72>	Malay ko ba kung ma-slash ang sino mang ma-'bad shot' di ba?	what if those with a 'bad shot' were slashed right?
<73>	Batid ko rin na 12 lamang ang Scout Ranger Companies.	I also knew that there were only 12 scout ranger companies.
<74>	Tatlo rito ay nasa Mindanao kagaya ng 1st SR Company na pinamunuan ni Cpt Cirilito Sobejana, 4th SR Company na pinamunuan ni 1st Lt Angel Sievert at ang 6th SR Company na pinamunuan ng isa pang legendary warrior na si Cpt Robert Edward Lucero.	three of these are in Mindanao like the 1st SR company led by Captain Cirilito Sobejana, 4th SR company led by 1st Lieutenant Angel Sievert, and the 6th SR company led by one more legendary warrior Captain Robert Edward Lucero.
<75>	Ang problema, halos lahat kami ay gustong mapunta sa Mindanao, lalo na sa Basilan.	the problem, almost all of us want to go to Mindanao, especially in Basilan.
<76>	Nag-aagawan kaming mapunta sa frontline bilang Platoon Leader.	we were competing to be placed on the frontline as platoon leader.
<77>	Alangan namang garrison ang gugustuhin namin!	as if we wanted the garrison!
<78>	Dahil sa agawang ito, ang ginawa ng aming Personnel Officer (G1) na si Cpt Rene Glen Paje ay 'draw lots' kami kung sino ang ma-swerte na mapunta sa assignment na may gyera.	because of this competition, what our personal officer (G1) Captain Rene Glen Paje did was 'draw lots' who will be the lucky to be placed in an assignment with war.
<79>	Totoo yon, ang yunit na may gyera ang pinag-aagawan naming mapuntahan.	that is true, the unit with fighting is what we were competing to go to.
<80>	Nang bunutin ko ang aking papel, napasigaw ako ng 'Eureka!'.	when I drew my paper, I shouted "eureka!".
<81>	Nakuha ko ang 1st Scout Ranger Company na nakadestino sa Basilan.	I got the 1st scout ranger company designated in Basilan.
<82>	Sobra na akong excited na sumabak sa tunay na gyera!	I was already very excited to step into real war!
<83>	Feeling proud, nagkamayan at nag-high fives na kami ng aking PMA beast barracks squadmate na si Manny Cabasan na sya namang nakakuha ng 4th Scout Ranger Company.	feeling proud, I shook hands and did high fives with my PMA beast barracks squad member Manny Cabasan who got the 4th scout ranger company.
<84>	"Magka-buddy tayo doon sa Basilan, squadmate.	"we will be buddies there in Basilan, squadmate.
<85>	Mapapasabak tayong sabay nito!"	we will be tested at the same time!"
<86>	Kinaumagahan, pinatawag ako ni Cpt Paje para sa importanteng instruction.	the next morning, Captain Paje called for me for an important instruction.
<87>	"Mister Cabunoc, powerlifter at judo player ka pala.	"Mister Cabunoc, so you are a powerlifter and judo player.
<88>	Mas maiging dito ka muna sa headquarters sa Fort Bonifacio para turuan ang mga bata ng weights training program at combative sport," sabi nya.	it will be better if you stay here first in the headquarters in Fort Bonifacio to teach the kids weight training program and combative sport," he said.
<89>	Nagulantang ako.	I was startled.
<90>	Parang gumuho ang mundo.	it was as if the world collapsed.
<91>	Parang nasalanta ako ng bagyo.	it was as if I was devastated by typhoon.
<92>	Low morale ako.	I was low in morale.
<93>	"Pero sir, ang nabunot ko ay 1st SRC na nasa Basilan," paliwanag ko at appealing to pity pa.	"but sir, what I drew was 1st SRC in Basilan," I explained and even appealed to pity.
<94>	"Sinabi ko na nga ang dahilan eh.	"I already stated the reason.
<95>	Di mo naman matatapos ang gyera dyan sa Basilan kung pupunta ka doon.	you will not end the war there in Basilan if you go there.
<96>	Bukas, gusto ko ipresent mo sa akin ang weights training program ng mga tropa natin," nakakunot na ang noo ng aming G1.	tomorrow, I want you to present to me the weights training program of our troops," the forehead of our G1 was already wrinkled.
<97>	Kamot-ulo ako sa nangyari kasi hindi yon ang aking inaasahan.	what happened was a head-scratcher to me because it was not what I expected.
<98>	Gusto ko na agad makapiling ang mga mandirigma sa field at makatulong sa combat-rescue missions na ongoing sa Basilan sa mga panahon na iyon.	I wanted to be together immediately with the fighters in the field and help in the combat-rescue missions ongoing in Basilan at that time.
<99>	Si Lt. James Sababan ang pumalit sa akin na magiging Platoon Leader ng 1st Scout Ranger (We Dare) Company.	Lieutenant James Sababan replaced me in being platoon leader of the 1st scout ranger (we dare) company.
<100>	Non-combatants	non-combatants
<101>	Pagbalik namin sa barracks, grabe ang tawanan ng lahat lalo na yong mga ma-assigned sa field.	when we returned to the barracks, severe was the laughter of everybody especially those assigned to the field.
<102>	Sino ba naman ang happy na assigned nga sa Rangers eh, mataguriang 'headquarters boys' at 'non-combatants'?	who would be happy to be assigned to the rangers, then called 'headquarters boy' and 'non-combatants'?
<103>	Kasama ko sa napabilang sa 'non-combatants' (ayon sa kantyaw ng aming mistah na si Lt Ruben 'Gino' Guinolbay) ay sina Gani Criste, Mon Almodovar, Clifford Cordova at si Rommel Pagayon.	together with me included in the 'non-combatants' (based on the nickname of our Mistah Lieutenant Ruben "Gino" Guinolbay) were Gani Criste, Mon Almodovar, Clifford Cordova and Rommel Pagayon.
<104>	Instead na nakikipagbabakan kami sa bundok, napapasabak kami sa mga parada.	instead of us fighting in the mountains, we took on parades.
<105>	Tuwing hapon ay nasa weights room naman ako upang turuan ang aming mga sundalo sa tamang pag-gamit ng mga kagamitan doon.	every afternoon I was in the weights room to teach our soldiers the right use of our equipment there.
<106>	Kapag umaga ay nakikipag-sambuno ako sa iilang tropa para magturo ng basic throwing at grappling techniques ng judo.	in the morning I wrestle with some troops to throw basic throwing and grappling techniques in judo.
<107>	Iilang linggo lang ang lumipas, inggit na inggit kami pag nababasa namin na napapasabak na sa Basilan sina Manny Cabasan at James Sababan.	a few weeks passed, we were really jealous when we read that Manny Cabasan and James Sababan are sent to Basilan.
<108>	Matiyaga kaming nakikinig sa URC 187 radio tuwing nagbabalitaan tungkol sa bakbakan noon sa Basilan na kung saan ay magkasunod na malubhang nasugatan ang mga mandirigmang Company Commanders na sina Cpt Sobejana at 1st Lt Sievert.	we diligently listened to URC 187 radio when we hear about the fighting back then in Basilan wherein the members of the fighting company commanders Captain Sobejana and 1st Lieutenant Sievert were consecutively severely injured.
<109>	Dahil wala kaming magawa sa sitwasyon, ika nga ay pinaganda na lang namin ang aming kalagayan.	because we could not do anything about the situation, as they say we just improved our condition.
<110>	Bilang paghahanda sa aming schooling, nagpalakas kami ng aming pangangatawan sa mga physical training activities.	in preparation for our schooling, we strengthened our bodies through physical training activities.
<111>	Sumasabay kami sa mahahabang takbuhan ng mga Musang na nasa garrison.	we joined the long runs of the Musangs in the garrison.
<112>	Katagalan, natuto at na-enjoy rin kami sa mga kalokohang pang-Musang na chanting na kagaya nito:"Tsaa, kapi, tsukulati. Tsaa kapi na may bulati! Rinjir, uwaa. Irburn. Uwaa!"	eventually, we learned and enjoyed the antics for Musangs chanting like this: "tea, coffee, chocolate. tea coffee with worm! ranger, uwaa. air bomb . uwaa!"
<113>	Sa una lang tila ay nababagot ako.	it was only at first I seemed to be bored.
<114>	Kasi naman pre, instead na M16 Rifle ang aking binubuhat, dumb bells at barbells ang inabot ko!	because bro, instead of me carrying an M16 rifle, I ended up with dumbbells and barbells!
<115>	Enebeyen!	what!
<116>	Sa totoo lang, parang gusto kong maluha sa aking sinapit ngunit pinag-igian ko na lang ang pagiging weights training instructor sa mga payatot na Rangers na kalimitan ay sa takbuhan lamang malalakas.	the truth is, I felt like crying about my fate but I just did well in being a weights training instructor to the skinny rangers who often excel only in running.
<117>	Ang kagandahan, natuto akong makisalamuha sa mga musang (Ranger warriors).	the benefit, I learned to go along with the Musang (ranger warriors).
<118>	Karamihan sa kanila ay mga beterano na sa mga bakbakan.	many of them were already veterans of battles.
<119>	Natutunan ko paano dalhin ang isang Pilipinong sundalo.	I learned how to bear a Filipino soldier.
<120>	Hindi namin natutunan iyon sa PMA na panay kadete din lang ang pinamumunuan namin.	we did not learn that in the PMA where we supervised over cadets only.
<121>	Para maliwanagan sa totoong buhay sundalo sa field, sa mga beteranong Musang ko itinatanong ang mga karanasan nila sa mga bakbakan at pati sa mga challenges sa field.	to be enlightened in the real life of a soldier in the field, it was the veteran Musangs I asked their experience in encounters and even challenges in the field.
<122>	Naririnig ko sa kanila pati kwento ng mga diumano ay mga palpak na lider at mga iniidolong lider.	I heard from them even stories of alleged failure leaders and idolized leaders.
<123>	Napag-alaman ko na inaabangan nila ang baptism of fire ng mga bagong tenyente.	I learned that they await the baptism of fire of new lieutenants.
<124>	Inoobserbahan nila kung natataranta ang mga ito at namumutla sa gitna ng nagliliparang bala.	they observe if these become confused and pale in the midst of flying bullets.
<125>	Syempre, pulutan ang Segunda Kamote na mataguriang 'talawan' ng mga Bisaya o 'tagirgir' ng mga Ilokano.	of course, the sweet potato tops which they call 'talawan' by Visayans or 'tagirgir' by Ilocanos is the appetizer.
<126>	Dahil may mga magandang napupulot din naman ako sa aking trabahong garrison, tiniis-tiis ko muna ang pagiging 'Non-Combatant'.	because there are good things I pick up from my garrison work, I first endured being a non-combatant.
