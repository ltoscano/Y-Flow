<1>	(0.000-1.690)	<sta> andar ang mga balita .	news goes around .
<2>	(1.690-7.235)	sino 'yung mga tingin mo na dapat sa tingin mo na kalabanin ni Manny ?	who are the ones whom you think you should think must go against Manny ?
<3>	(7.235-17.050)	sa akin unang-una siguro <hes> talking about 'yung kaniyang career beyond itong laban na ito ang paniwala ko is dapat twenty fourteen should be his last year .	for me first and foremost talking about his career beyond this game my belief is twenty fourteen should be his last year .
<4>	(17.050-17.959)	okey that's one .	okay that's one .
<5>	(17.959-23.000)	now <hes> in terms of pagpipilian dapat tatlo na lang ang pagpipilian ano ?	now in terms of selecting there should only be three options what do you think ?
<6>	(23.000-26.579)	pero sa tatlo maximum of two of course minimum of one .	but in those three maximum of two minimum of one .
<7>	(26.579-27.320)	bakit ?	why ?
<8>	(27.320-32.310)	'yung tatlo sa tingin ko Mayweather <hes> Juan Manuel Marquez at 'tsaka si Timothy Bradley .	those three I think are Mayweather Juan Manuel Marquez and Timothy Bradley .
<9>	(32.310-35.641)	the rest sa tingin ko hindi na dapat labanan pa ni Manny .	the rest I think shouldn't be fought by Manny anymore .
<10>	(35.641-37.440)	now bakit dalawa ?	now why two ?
<11>	(37.440-44.580)	kung ayaw ni Mayweather sa tingin ko puwede na 'yung Bradley o Marquez dahil tingin ko 'yun ang mayro'n pang- -- unfinished business si Manny .	if Mayweather doesn't want to I think Bradley or Marquez is okay because I think Manny has unfinished business with them .
<12>	(44.580-51.740)	now kung mapapayag niya na after this fight si Marquez ah si <hes> Mayweather sa tingin ko 'yun na .	now if they persuade Marquez ah Mayweather after this fight that'll be it .
<13>	(51.740-55.554)	talaga <overlap> kalimutan na <overlap> 'yun na 'yung talagang one fight ano final ?	really forget the one final fight ?
<14>	(55.554-65.901)	kasi alam mo ako -- ako ang feeling ko ah if labanan niya si Mayweather after this fight sa tingin ko kaya niyang talunin si Mayweather because of his style <overlap> kaya 'yon <overlap> because of his style why ?	because you know me -- me my feelings ah if he will fight Mayweather after this fight I think he can defeat Mayweather because of his style that's it because of his style why ?
<15>	(65.901-77.498)	because of <hes> sabi ko nga against Manny Pacquiao kailangan mayro'n kang pasensiya na katulad ng kay Marquez na kahit na tinatamaan kahit bumabagsak patience pa rin babalikan kita .	because of as I have said against Manny Pacquiao you need to have patience similar to Marquez even though being hit even falling down still patience I will get back on you .
<16>	(77.498-82.469)	feeling ko walang gano'n si Mayweather and Mayweather is not really a quick fighter .	I feel Mayweather does not have that Mayweather and Mayweather is not really a quick fighter .
<17>	(82.469-92.565)	magulang lang siya hindi naman siya 'yung tumatakbo na defensive na -- ang depensa niya is tatakpan ko sarili shoulder <hes> roll and then aakapin kita .	he is only ripe he is that the one who's running whose defensive that -- his defense I will cover myself with my shoulder roll and then I will hug you .
<18>	(92.565-96.583)	name a fighter na nakaakap kay Manny <overlap> kay Manny ?	name a fighter who has hugged Manny to Manny ?
<19>	(96.583-97.007)	wala .	none .
<20>	(97.007-106.247)	<sta> and in every H_B_O twenty four seven nakikita natin ang na-ha-highlight kay <sta> Mayweather 'yung pagka pikon niya sa tatay niya .	and in every H_B_O twenty four seven we have been watching what is highlighted on Mayweather is his ill-tempered on his father .
<21>	(106.247-109.992)	nag-aaway sila so feeling ko short ang patience nitong oo .	they are quarreling I am feeling his patience is short yes .
<22>	(109.992-111.840)	si <overlap> mapipikon na naman ito .	see this will be ill-tempered .
<23>	(111.840-121.739)	I feel that Mayweather he wants to fight Pacquiao pero hindi 'yung Pacquiao na nakakalaban ni De la Hoya na nakalaban ni Cotto na nakalaban ni Margarito .	I feel that Mayweather he wants to fight Pacquiao but not the Pacquiao whom De la Hoya had fought Cotto had fought that Margarito had fought .
<24>	(121.739-125.124)	ayaw niya ng gano'n ang inaantay niyang Pacquiao 'yung pagka bumagal ka na .	he does not want like that the Pacquiao he has been waiting for when you have slowed down .
<25>	(125.124-125.783)	matanda na ?	already old ?
<26>	(125.783-139.034)	<overlap> oo 'yun 'yun ang <overlap> so ngayon nga dapat ngayon din bilisan na natin <overlap> alam mo puwede alam mo kasi ang nakita ko sa laban na ito is <hes> hindi siya kasimbilis 'nong nakalaban niya si De la Hoya .	yes that that the so now for now it should be let us hasten you know it could be you know because I see in this fight is he is not as quick as the one fought against De la Hoya .
<27>	(139.034-143.810)	kumbaga 'nong De la Hoya Cotto et al <hes> five six punch combo .	for instance the De la Hoya Cotta et al five six punch combo .
<28>	(143.810-148.211)	dito tatlo apat lang eh so baka isipin ni Mayweather uy eto bumabagal na eh .	here three four only so Mayweather might think oh here slowing down already .
<29>	(148.211-149.323)	kumakaunti na combi .	the combi gets fewer .
<30>	(149.323-159.010)	ngayon dalawang dalawang ano 'yan two things puwedeng maaaring 'yung edad pumapasok na or probably kaya tatlo apat lang hindi siya gano'n kabilis siguro nakit- -- na-feel niya na kaya ko na 'to .	now two two that is can be two things might the age is entering or probably there is three four only he is not that quick maybe he feels I can do this .
<31>	(159.010-163.812)	<cough> medyo boxing boxing na lang <overlap> delikado si Mayweather pagka 'yun ang sitwasyon .	somewhat only boxing boxing Mayweather is dangerous if that's the situation .
<32>	(163.812-165.801)	be sure to comeback .	be sure to comeback .
