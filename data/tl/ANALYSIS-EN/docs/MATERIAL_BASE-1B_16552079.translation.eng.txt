change in 2014 is getting worse and worse.
is there change to be expected from the national government this year?
and even in the local government?
according to one survey, 94 percent are expecting a big change when the new year, 2014, comes.
but with what we see, there is nothing.
if there is, maybe all of them would be more like misfortunes.
look, dudes, when January 1 came, oil companies immediately raised the prices of petroleum.
the reaction of the government of PNoy?
nothing!
the price of liquefied petroleum gas was rolled back a little, but if for instance the LPG Marketeer's Association did not do a rollback first, oil companies would probably not do a rollback too.
one more thing, dude.
fares at the LRT and MRT would go up any day starting this month.
how much?
there is no definite amount yet but it would take quite a huge chunk from the daily wages of workers and students.
at first, it was said that the government would build LRT's and MRT's so that the commute of citizens would be light on the pocket and fast, and the environment in Metro Manila would be free from pollution.
now, its lightness in the pocket will vanish into thin air.
and it seems like they are making the trains break down constantly on purpose to have a reason for increasing the fare.
this is hopefully one convenient service that the government can give to the people, yet the opposite is about to happen.
the government does not want to spend for the citizens and what it wants is for companies, like owners of the MRT and LRT and oil companies, to profit all the time.
never mind if the citizen's lives go in disarray.
like the chaos being experienced until now by farmers and workers at Hacienda Luisita.
isn't it that the crops of farmers and workers at the estate were bulldozed when they were about to harvest recently?
