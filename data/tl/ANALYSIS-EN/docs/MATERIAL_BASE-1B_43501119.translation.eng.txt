the security is extreme in Intramuros for the shooting of the movie Borne Legacy .
the location where the scene of the stars were taken was covered .
one of the Filipino actors John Arcilla said that the international stars were kind and weren't arrogant .
Rachel Weiss even came to him and introduced herself .
Rachel is also interested in politics -- and issue of poverty in the country which she observed while she's here in the Philippines .
<no-speech>
if those are the poor or are there people who are poorer ?
<no-speech>
I said there are many that are much -- poorer in fact I said there are a lot of people living under the bridge I said of -- of the bridges of Manila I said .
and then she's really very sad .
