Maine, walang kalatuy-latoy!
By Ruel Mendoza June 21, 2016 Nag-celebrate ng kanyang first anniversary sa showbiz ang phenomenal Kalyeserye star na si Maine Mendoza a.k.a. Yaya Dub noong nakaraang June 19. Iyon kasi ang araw ng kanyang pag-audition sa Eat Bulaga.
Inamin na noon ni Maine na hindi niya alam ang kanyang ginagawa sa audition dahil hindi raw siya marunong kumanta, sumayaw at mag-host. Ang alam lang daw niya ay ang magpapanget ng mukha.
Isa sa napili ng staff ng Eat Bulaga si Maine para mag-audition sa magiging apo/yaya ng papasok na Lola Nidora character ni Wally Bayola sa segment na E.B. Problem Solving bago pa ito naging Kalyeserye. Napanood kasi si Maine sa mga dubsmash videos niya sa YouTube kaya siya pinag-audition. Walang nakapagsabi na ang mahiyaing nag-audition na ito ay magiging isang multi-media superstar at isa sa pinaka-in-demand na celebrity endorser.
Heto ang pinost ni Maine sa kanyang pagsariwa ng unang araw niya sa studio ng Eat Bulaga… “It was this time last year when I first set my foot on Broadway Centrum. June 19, 2015 was the day I auditioned for Eat Bulaga.
“I can still remember how nervous and timid I was as I stand in the middle of the stage, facing the camera.
“It’s been a year but I still wonder how I was able to survive that audition unprepared.
“People who tried out their luck along with me that day were all psyched-up and had everything prepared; and then there I was, as Ma’am Jenny would describe it, “Walang kalatuy-latoy”.
“Those who have seen my audition video could tell that there was nothing striking in me when I stood up on that stage–aside from my big red lips that took people’s attention–there was clearly nothing more.
“I mustered an ounce of confidence to act like a crazy woman when I was asked to, thinking that would be the only way to get a chance to pass the audition. I was able to do it but I knew I did it horribly.

“I was discouraged and I already knew right there and then that I lost my chance.
“Still, I was holding onto this little possibility that they’d call me back, also thinking that even if they don’t, I am glad and proud that I did not let this opportunity pass me by.
“I went home with a smile on my face, gave myself a pat on the back and told myself “At least you tried.”
And the rest, ‘ika nga nila, is history…”
