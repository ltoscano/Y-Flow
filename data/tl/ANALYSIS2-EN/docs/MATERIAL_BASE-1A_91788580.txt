Kibaki said, "it was purported by his friends that he went to Awendo to greet a relative on his mother's side and then got involved in criminal activity, including motorcycle theft in order to sell it here to get money. that is when he was killed, while stealing it, he was attacked by stones and clubs and died instantly."
