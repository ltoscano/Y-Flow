<2>	Feb 28, 2014	February 28, 2014
<3>	VYOMBO vya dola ikiwamo Jeshi la Polisi nchini katika maeneo ya mipakani, vinashirikiana na wahalifu katika biashara ya usafirishaji wa binadamu, uvushaji wa biadhaa za magendo kwa wafanyabiashara wanaokwepa kodi, usafirishaji wa mirungi na dawa za kulevya kama bangi, uchunguzi wa Raia Mwema umebaini.	Raia Mwema's investigation has revealed that state organizations including the police force in the border regions of the country are cooperating with offenders in the business of human trafficking, ferrying contraband goods for businessmen who evade taxes, transportation of khat and narcotics such as marijuana.
<4>	Polisi ambao moja ya kazi yao kubwa ni kudhibiti uhalifu kwa kusimamia sheria zilizopo, baadhi yao wamebainika sasa kuhusika katika kashfa hiyo huku vyombo vingine vikiwa nyuma yao katika kulinda na kusaidia uhalifu wa mipakani, vitendo vinavyotishia hata amani na usalama wa nchi.	some police, of which a big part of their work is to control crime by upholding the laws which exist, have been revealed to be involved in the scandal while other organizations are backing them up to protect and help crime at the border, actions which threaten the peace and safety of the nation.
<5>	Tayari ripoti ya mwaka jana inaonyesha kwamba polisi wa Tanzania ni moja ya taasisi za umma zinazoongoza kwa vitendo vya rushwa katika nchi tano zinazounda Jumuiya ya Afrika Mashariki.	last year's report already shows that the Tanzania police is one of the public institutions that leads in the amount of bribery in the five countries making up Eastern African.
<6>	Takwimu za rushwa (East Africa Bribery Index) za mwaka 2013, zinaonyesha ya kuwa kwa Tanzania, Jeshi hilo linashika nafasi ya kwanza kwa malalamiko ya rushwa ikifuatiwa na idara ya mahakama, taasisi ambazo zimekuwa ndizo zinapaswa kusimamia haki.	the East African Bribery Index for 2013 shows that for Tanzania, the force holds the first place in corruption complaints followed by the judiciary, institutions that are supposed to uphold justice.
<7>	Taasisi hizo ndizo zinazohudumia watu wengi nchini.	these institutions are the ones that serve a lot of people in the country.
<8>	Aidha, kwa nchi za Afrika Mashariki, Jeshi hilo linashika nafasi ya pili likitanguliwa na Jeshi la Polisi la Burundi huku Rwanda ikishika nafasi ya chini kwa vitendo vya rushwa katika taasisi zake za umma.	moreover, for Eastern Africa countries, the force holds second position after the Burundi police force while Rwanda holds the last position in acts of corruption in its public institutions.
<9>	Tuhuma, malalamiko na matukio dhidi ya askari wa Jeshi hilo wasio waaminifu ni nyingi na zimetamalaki katika maeneo mbalimbali ya Tanzania, ikiwa ni moja ya changamoto kubwa kwa Mkuu mpya wa Jeshi la Polisi Tanzania, Ernest Mangu, aliyeingia rasmi madarakani mwaka huu baada ya kuteuliwa mwishoni kabisa mwa mwaka 2013.	there have been many accusations, complaints and scenes against police officers of the force and have spread in many regions of Tanzania which is one of the major challenges for the new Tanzanian Inspector General of Police, Ernest Mangu, who was officially given authority this year after being nominated at the very end of 2013.
<10>	Moja ya maeneo ambayo Raia Mwema imethibitisha kuwapo kwa vitendo hivyo ni katika mipaka iliyopo katika mikoa Kaskazini ya Arusha, Kilimanjaro na Tanga.	one of the regions, Raia Mwema, that has proven the existence of these acts is on the borders that exist along the Northern provinces of Arusha, Kilimanjaro and Tanga.
<11>	Miongoni mwa tuhuma zinazoelekezwa kwa jeshi hilo katika wilaya ya Longido Mkoa wa Arusha ni pamoja na ushiriki wao katika biashara ya usafirishaji wa binadamu, kusimamia uvushaji wa bidhaa za magendo kwa wafanyabiashara wanaokwepa kodi, usafirishaji wa mirungi na madawa mingine ya kulevya kama bangi.	among the accusations directed towards the force in the Longido district in the Arusha province is with their involvement in the business of human trafficking, overseeing the ferrying of contraband goods for businessmen who evade taxes and the transportation of khat and drugs such as marijuana.
<12>	Uchunguzi uliofanywa na Raia Mwema kwa zaidi ya miezi mitatu katika mikoa ya Kanda ya Kaskazini ambayo inatajwa kama “lango kuu” la kuingilia wahamiaji haramu na biashara ya kusafirisha binadamu unafichua ushiriki wa askari polisi katika biashara hiyo.	investigations done by Raia Mwema for more than three months in the provinces of the Northern region, which is mentioned as "The Gate" for illegal immigrants to enter and the business of human trafficking, discloses the cooperation of police in this business.
<13>	Biashara hiyo ya kusafirisha wahamiaji kutoka nchi za pembe ya Afrika ni kati ya biashara kongwe “haramu” katika mikoa hii ya Kaskazini ambayo ni Arusha, Kilimanjaro na Tanga na hufahamika sana kwa jina la “biashara ya kula vichwa”.	the business of transporting immigrants from the countries in the horn of Africa is among the oldest illegal businesses in the Northern provinces of Arusha, Kilimanjaro and Tanga and is well-known by the name "the business of eating heads".
<14>	Biashara hii imepachikwa jina hilo la biashara ya “vichwa” na mawakala pamoja na mtandao unaohusika ambao huwahusisha baadhi ya watumishi wa vyombo nyeti vya dola kama polisi na maafisa uhamiaji.	the business has been branded the "heads" business by lawyers together with the relevant internet which involves some of the state secret servants such as police and emigrant officers.
<15>	Uchunguzi wa Raia Mwema umekutana na uthibitisho au ushahidi wa ushiriki wa askari polisi na katika biashara hiyo inayokisiwa kuhusisha mabilioni ya shilingi ikiwa ni pamoja na kuwapo kwa barua iliyoandikwa na askari polisi mmoja kwenda kwa uongozi wa serikali na Polisi Mkoa wa Arusha.	Raia Mwema's investigations have come across confirmation or evidence of cooperation from police in this business which is suspected to involve billions of shillings together with the existence of a letter written by one police officer to the head of state and police in the Arusha province.
<16>	Barua yafichua uozo wa polisi	the letter reveals the inefficiency of the police
<17>	Barua hiyo, ambayo nakala tunayo, imeanika ushiriki wa askari wa jeshi hilo wa wilaya ya mpakani ya Longido katika biashara hiyo haramu, barua hiyo ilipokewa katika Ofisi za Upelelezi Mkoa Aprili 30 mwaka 2013.	that letter, of which we have a copy, has exposed the cooperation of officers from the force of the border district of Longido in this illegal business, the letter was received by the investigations offices in April 30, 2013.
<18>	Taarifa za kipolisi zinaeleza ya kuwa barua hiyo ilipokewa na aliyekuwa Ofisa Upelelezi Mkoa wa Arusha, Cammilius Wambura ambaye kwa sasa amehamishiwa mkoani Dar es Salaam akiwa na cheo kipya cha Kamanda wa Polisi Mkoa wa Kinondoni.	police reports explain that the letter was received by the investigation officer in the Arusha province, Cammilius Wambura, who has since been moved to the Dar es Salaam province after getting a new post as the police commander in the Kinondoni province.
<19>	Askari aliyeandika barua hiyo (jina lake linahifadhiwa) ameorodhesha majina ya askari polisi sita wa Kituo cha mpakani cha Namanga na askari polisi saba wa Kituo cha Polisi Wilaya ya Longido ambao alidai wanashiriki biashara hiyo akiwataja majina na namba zao za kijeshi.	the police officer who wrote the letter (name withheld) has listed the names of six police from the Namanga border station and seven police officers from a police station in the Longido district who he claimed participated in the business, mentioning their names and their service numbers.
<20>	Katika barua hiyo akitoa mfano askari huyo anabainisha kuwa Mei mwaka jana (2012) askari G3904 PC Ibrahim na G.2487 PC Patrick walisafirisha wahamiaji wa Kisomali kwa kutumia gari ya askari namba E.6105, CPL Chriss kutoka Namanga kwenda Arusha Mjini.	in the letter, the police officer gives an example, clarifying that in May last year (2012) police officer G3904 PC Ibrahim and G.2487 PC Patrick transported Somali immigrants using a car belonging to police number E.6105, CPL Chriss from Namanga to the town of Arusha.
<21>	Anaeleza kuwa gari hilo lilipofika eneo la Lengijave wilayani Arumeru lilipata ajali mbaya na kati ya Wasomali wanne waliokuwapo mmoja alifariki dunia na wengine watatu walijeruhiwa vibaya sana.	he explains that when the car reached Lengijave in the Arumeru district, it was involved in a terrible accident and among the four Somalis involved, one died and the others were badly injured.
<22>	Askari hao waliuchukua mwili wa marehemu aliyefariki na kwenda kuutupa katika msitu wa Oldonyosambu na majeruhi watatu walipakiwa katika gari la kampuni ya Kichina inayojenga barabara na kuwapelekea hospitali moja binafsi mjini Arusha.	the police took the body and went to throw it in the Oldonyosambu forest and the tree injured were packed in a car from the Chinese company that constructs roads and were taken to a private hospital in Arusha.
