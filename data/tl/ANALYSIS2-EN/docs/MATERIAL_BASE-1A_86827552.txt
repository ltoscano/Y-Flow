<1>	Ushirika ukiboreshwa utasaidia kupunguza umaskini nchini	if cooperation is improved it will help reduce poverty in the country
<2>	Ushirika ni moja kati ya nyenzo muhimu za kupunguza na kupambana na umaskini kwa watu wa kipato cha chini.	cooperation is one of the important components in reducing and dealing with poverty for people with low incomes.
<3>	Ushirika unaruhusu umiliki wa rasilimali ambazo zinafanyiwa uamuzi wa pamoja na kunufaisha wengi kwenye kilimo, masoko, fedha na mambo mengi mengine ya ujasiriamali.	cooperation allows ownership of resources that are decided over generally and to benefit many in farming, markets, money and many other resourceful things.
<4>	Lakini, kama zilivyo sekta nyingine, kuna umuhimu wa kuangalia baadhi ya maeneo ili kutengeneza msingi mzuri wa biashara kwa ushirika kujiendesha kitaasisi na kuwashawishi wanachama ushirika ni biashara nzuri.	but, just like there are other sectors, there is the importance of looking at some regions in order to create good business foundations in cooperation as an institution and to convince businessmen that cooperation is good business.
<5>	Matumizi mabaya ya fedha ni moja kati ya eneo ambalo kwa kiasi kikubwa limekuwa na malalamiko yanayoleta sintofahamu miongoni mwa wanachama wa ushirika kutokana na kuathiri vyama vya ushirika na vile vya kuweka na kukopa.	improper money use is one of the areas that, in a big way, has had complaints which bring disagreements among cooperative members because it affects cooperative societies and the savings and credit ones.
<6>	Matumizi haya yamekuwa yakitokana na uamuzi wa viongozi na watendaji wanaofanya hivyo kwa manufaa binafsi.	these uses have resulted from the decisions of leaders and executives who have been doing that for personal benefits.
<7>	Ili kukabiliana na baadhi ya changamoto, inapendekezwa kutumia wataalamu wa ushirika kusimamia taasisi hizo.	in order to tackle some challenges, it is suggested to use cooperative experts to manage those institutions.
<8>	Kutokana na ukweli kwamba ushirika ni eneo la aina yake na linahitaji wataalamu wake ni muhimu kuwa nao katika ngazi za utendaji wa chama.	from the fact that cooperation is an area on its own, and needs its experts, it is important to have them on the level of performance of the association.
<9>	Kwa mfano, Saccos zinahitaji wataalamu wa sekta ndogo za fedha hivyo ni muhimu kuwatumia watu wenye elimu husika ili kufanya chama kuwa eneo la ubunifu, ushindani wa kibiashara na kuwarithisha wateja wake kwa viwango vinavyotakiwa.	for example, SACCOS need experts in small money sectors, therefore it is important to use people with relevant education in order to make the associations have an area of creativity to satisfy its customers to desired levels.
<10>	Kuwekeza kwenye tafiti ili kujiwekea mazingira mazuri ya kutambua njia za ubunifu, ushindani kutoka kwenye taasisi kubwa za fedha kwa upande wa Saccos kama zilivyokuwa sekta nyingine.	to invest in research to create a proper environment of identifying creative means, competition from big financial institutions on the side of SACCOS as with other sectors.
<11>	Utafiti unasaidia kufanikisha mambo mengi ya kitaasisi hivyo ni vema kuwekeza zaidi kwenye eneo hili ili kuja na bidhaa na huduma zenye nguvu ya kushindana na taasisi kubwa za fedha.	research helps to achieve many institutional things, therefore it is important to invest more in this area to come up with goods and services that have the power to compete with big financial institutions.
<12>	Iikumbukwe, utafiti ni nguzo kwenye mipango na uamuzi wa kibiashara ya ushirika.	it should be remembered that research is a pillar in planning and business decision-making of cooperatives.
<13>	Uongozi mzuri, unaoanzia kwenye bodi za vyama vya ushirika, kamati na watendaji wake unahitajika kufanikisha malengo ya kibiashara ya ushirika.	good leadership, which starts from the board of cooperative associations, committees and its executives, is supposed to attain the business objectives of the cooperative.
<14>	Viongozi wenye maarifa, maono, wanaofahamu majukumu yao na uwezo wa kusukuma ushirika kwa kuwajibika na uadilifu wa hali ya juu wanahitajika.	leaders with knowledge, vision, who understand their responsibilities and the ability to push for cooperation with high ethical standards and responsibility are required.
<15>	Tukiwapata watu wa aina hii itakuwa ni moja ya hatua nzuri za kutengeneza msingi imara wa kibaishara kwa vyama vya ushirika nchini.	if we get this kind of people, it will be one of the positive steps to making firm business foundations for cooperatives in the country.
<16>	Kutoingiliwa na siasa.	absence of political interference.
<17>	Wengi tunafahamu siasa zinapenya mpaka kwenye vyama vya ushirika lakini ni vema watendaji, wanachama na viongozi wakaepuka kuonyesha masilahi yao ya kisiasa kwenye ushirika.	most of us know that politics penetrates into cooperatives but it is better for the executives, members and leaders to avoid showing their political interests in the cooperatives.
<18>	Ushirika ni biashara hivyo inatakiwa iheshimiwa kama taasisi nyingine na kuachwa kutekeleza maamuzi, utendaji na mipango yake ya maendeleo kwa mujibu wa sheria.	cooperation is a business and so should therefore be respected like any other institution and be left to execute decisions, performance and its development plans according to the law.
<19>	Kutengeneza mtandao mzuri ambao utakuwa unaweka nafasi ya wajumbe wa vyama vya ushirika kusadiana ni jambo muhimu kwa mushakabali wa wanachama.	making a good network that will keep a place for members of cooperative organizations to help each other is an important thing for the future of members.
<20>	Ili kutengeneza uwezo wa kuwafaidisha kibiashara ni vizuri ukawepo mtandao wenye uwezo wa kupata taarifa za masoko, elimu na mafanikio ili kujifunza.	in order to be able to benefit business-wise, it is better to have a network with the ability to get market information, education and achievements in order to learn.
<21>	Kuandaa wanachama hai wanaotumia huduma na kutambua kwamba ushirika ni mali yao hivyo ni vyema kuwa na ubunifu wa bidhaa na huduma utakaofanya wanachama kukubali na kuendelea kubakia na chama bila kwenda popote.	in order to prepare live members who use the service and to know that cooperation is their asset, it is, therefore, better to have innovate products and services that will make members accept and remain with the association without going anywhere.
<22>	Msingi wa biashara kwa ushirika ni lazima utengenezwe kwa mawazo chanya yenye ubunifu wa hali ya juu na vyama vijitathimini na kujiongeza kwa kuwekeza kwenye maeneo yenye tija ili kuboresha taasisi hizo ili kupiga hatua ya kweli kibiashara.	the basis of business in cooperation must be made with a positive mind with a high level of creativity and associations to evaluate and expand themselves by investing in areas of profit to improve those institutions in order to make a real business step.
