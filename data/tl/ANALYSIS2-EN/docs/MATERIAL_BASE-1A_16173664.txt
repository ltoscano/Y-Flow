<1>	Tuzo ya ubora iambatane na mchango wa mhusika kijumla	the award for best performance should be linked to the total contribution of the one involved
<2>	Na ABDULRAHMAN SHERIFF	by Abdulrahman Sheriff
<3>	HUWA ni ajabu kubwa kwa mtu kupata tuzo ya juu zaidi yoyote ile ya kimichezo bila ya kuwa miongoni mwa wale wanaostahili kuhusishwa na mashindano ya kimataifa.	it is always astonishing for a person to get any top award in sports without being among those supposed to be involved in the international competitions.
<4>	Huwa ni mshangao mkubwa kwa mchezaji yeyote kutangazwa kuwa bora zaidi nchini bila ya yeye kuwa miongoni mwa wale kwenye kikosi cha timu ya taifa ya mchezo huo.	it is always a big surprise for any player to be announced the best in the country without him being among those in the squad of the national team of that game.
<5>	Maajabu yalitokea kwa upande wa marefarii kwani mshindi wa tuzo ya refar bora nchini Kenya mwaka 1991 kamwe hakufikiriwa kama mmoja wa wale waamuzi ambao walipendekezwa na wasimamizi wa soka nyakati hizo kuwa refarii wa kiwango cha kuxchezesha mechi za kimataifa.	the surprise came on the side of the referees for the winner of the best referee in Kenya for 1991 which was never thought as one of the referees suggested by the football governing body to be at the level of refereeing international matches those days.
<6>	Robert Kitunga angali analalamika na kuwa na uchungu mwingi wa kukosa kutimiza ndoto yake ya kuwa refarii mwenye kuchezesha za kimataifa zikiwemo zile za Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup, Kombe la Mataifa ya Bara Afrika na Kombe la Dunia.	Robert Kitunga still has complaints and a lot of pain  for failing to fulfill his dream of being a referee who supervises internationally, including those of the CECAFA Senior Challenge Cup, the African Cup of Nations and the World Cup.
<7>	Kitunga alikuwa mwamuzi aliyekuwa maarufu sio mkoani Pwani pekee bali kote nchini na hata kwenye miji mikubwa ya nchi jirani za Tanzania na Uganda lakini bado anashindwa kufahamu ni nini hakuwa miongoni mwa waamuzi wa kiwango cha Fifa.	Kitunga was a famous referee not just in the Coast province but in the whole country and even in the cities of neighboring countries like Tanzania and Uganda but still he fails to understand why he was not among the referees at the level of FIFA.
<8>	"Maajabu makubwa yalinipata kwani mbali kuwa mwamuzi bora wa Kenya mwaka wa 1991, kamwe jina langu halikuwamo katika listi ya wale waliochaguliwa kupata beji ya Fifa ambayo ingeliniruhusu kuchezesha mechi za kimataifa kote duniani.	"the big surprise got to me because apart from being the best referee of Kenya in 1991, my name was never among the list of those who were selected to get a FIFA badge which would allow me to referee international matches everywhere in the world.
<9>	Mpiga kipyenga huyo wa kale alidai kulikuwa na mtindo wa ufisadi mkubwa uliokuwa ukitumiwa na wakuu wa uteuzi wa marefarii wa kwenda Fifa wa kutaka pesa ili jina lako lipelekwe huko.	the former referee claimed that there was a trend of increasing corruption from the heads of the referees sent to FIFA selection team where they ask for money for your name to be put there.
<10>	"Mimi nilikataa kutoa pesa kwani nilihisi ni haki yangu kupendekezwa kuwa mwamuzi wa kimataifa na nilipokataa, sikufikiriwa.	"I refused to give the money because I felt it was my right to be proposed as an international referee and when I refused, I was not considered.
<11>	Nilimwachia Mungu na najua atanilipia kama si hapa duniani huko tutakapokwenda kijumla baada ya kuiaga dunia," akasema Kitunga.	I left it to God and I know he will vindicate me if not here on earth, then in the place where we shall all go to after depart from this world," Kitunga said.
<12>	Jagina huyo anaamini wakati huu, kuna mipangilio ya haki yanayotumika kuwachaguwa maregfarii wa Fifa.	that warrior believes this time there are transparent arrangements used to select the referees for FIFA.
<13>	Lakini akasema ikiwa bado mtindo wa ufisadi wa mapendeleo unafanyika, basi uchunguzi mkali ufanyike kuhakikisha wakosaji wanachukuliwa hatua kali.	but he said if the style of corruption and favoritism is still happening, then strict investigations should be carried out to ensure that harsh action is taken against the offenders.
<14>	"Kumnyima refarii haki anayostahili kwa sababu hakutoa hongo, ni kumdhulumu na kumkosesha ndoto aliyonayo ya kufikia kileleni mwa uchezeshaji wake wa mechi za kimataifa na hasa zile za Kombe la Dunia," anasema Kitunga.	"denying a referee the right he deserves because he did not pay a bribe is to oppress and deny him the dream he has of reaching the top of his refereeing at international games especially those of the world cup," says Kitunga.
<15>	Anadai ilimchukua miaka minane pekee tangu aanze kuchezesha soka kwake kushinda taji la mwamuzi bora.	he claimed that it took him only eight years since he started refereeing football to win the best referee award.
<16>	"Nilipoamua kuwa mwamuzi, nilifahamu sitachukua muda mrefu itafika siku nitakuwa mwamuzi bora zaidi hapa nchini na Afrika Mashariki na Kati," akasema.	"when I decided to be a referee, I knew I would not take a long time, a day would be reached when I will become the best referee here in the country and in East and Central Africa," he said.
<17>	Kabla ya kuwa mpiga kipyenga, Kitunga aliwahi yeye mwenyewe kuwa mchezaji kandanda katika klabu iliyokuwa maarufu ya Nyota FC ambayo hadi sasa inashiriki kwenye Ligi Kuu ya Pwani Kusini.	before becoming a referee, Kitunga himself had been a football player in the club that used to be the famous Nyota FC which, until now, participates in the South Coast major league.
<18>	Hapo zamani ilikuwa ligi ya Mombasa iliyokuwa na timu Feisal na Mwenge (Liverpool).	a long time ago, it was the Mombasa league that had the Feisal and Mwenge (Liverpool) teams.
<19>	Kitunga anasema hatasahau baadhi ya mechi kubwa alizowahi kuchezesha alipokuwa refarii zikiwemo zile Harambee Stars dhidi ya Kenya Breweries, AFC Leopards na Bandari, AFC Leopards na Re-Union, Gor Mahia na Rivatex, Simba ya Tanzania na Bandari na Alaskan dhidi ya Star Fish kati ya nyingine kadhaa.	Kitunga says he will never forget some of the big matches he refereed including the Harambee Stars versus the Kenya Breweries, the AFC Leopards and the Bandari, the AFC Leopards and Reunion, Gor Mahia and Rivatex, the Simba of Tanzania and Bandari and Alaskan versus the Star Fish among others.
<20>	Ingawa amestaafu kuchezesha kandanda, lakini bado mpiga kipyenga huyo wa kale huwa akiitwa kuchezesha mechi za timu za timu zinazokamiana ama `local derbies' kwenye miji ya Lamu, Kaloleni, Kilifi, Mombasa, Voi, Kwale, Ukunda na Malindi.	even though he is retired from refereeing football, the former referee still gets called to referee matches for those teams that are strong opponents or "local derbies" in the towns of Lamu, Kaloleni, Kilifi, Mombasa, Voi, Ukunda and Malindi.
