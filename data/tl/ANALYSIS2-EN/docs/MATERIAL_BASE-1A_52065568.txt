<2>	Athari Hizi Zimechambuliwa Na Mbunge David Kafulila	these effects have been analyzed by member of parliament David Kafulila
<3>	Sheria hii ni muhimu duniani kote na ndio maana hata Tanzania ilikuwa inangojea kupata sheria ya kuongoza masuala ya mitandao	this law is important worldwide and that is why Tanzania was also waiting to get a law to guide Internet issues.
<4>	yaani Cyber Law kutokana na uhalifu wa aina mbalimbali wa masuala ya mitandao.	that is, a Cyber Law, due to many Internet-related crimes.
<5>	Sifa kuu ya sheria ya kuongoza masuala ya mitandao ni kuweka bayana makosa ya mitandaoni na pia kuyatolea adhabu.	the biggest attribute of the cyber law is laying bare Internet crimes and also establishing the punishment for such crimes.
<6>	Sheria hii inayopitishwa kwa dharura madhara yake ni:	this law, which was passed as an emergency, has negative effects:
<7>	Moja, Kifungu 7 (2b): Mpokeaji wa ujumbe (receiver) anaweza kushtakiwa kwa kosa la kupokea ujumbe ambao sheria imeufanya kuwa wa jinai.	one, clause 7 (2b): a message recipient can be prosecuted for the crime of receiving a message which the law has criminalized.
<8>	(Mfano: Mtu akikuforwadia ujumbe, ukiupokea na wewe umefanya kosa la jinai).	(example: if someone receives a forwarded message, they have committed a crime)
<9>	Pili, Kifungu 21(1): Mtumia mtandao wa Intaneti yeyote hayuko salama kwani mtoa huduma wake analazimika kutoa habari zake kwa serikali pale zitakapohitajika (kwa lazima).	two, clause 21 (1): any Internet user is not safe because their Internet service provider is forced to provide information about them to the government whenever needed (a must).
<10>	Tatu, Kifungu 8: Itakuwa ni kosa la jinai kama mtu ataweka wazi nyaraka za siri za serikali hata kama ni nyaraka ya kusaidia nchi kwa ujumla (Mfano: Matumizi mabaya ya mali ya umma).	three, clause 8: it will be a criminal offense for anyone to publish secret government documents even if they are documents that help the country in general (example: misuse of public resources).
<11>	Nne, Kifungu 14: Picha yoyote yenye mwelekeo unaoweza kuonekana kama ‘mchafu kingono’ inaweza kupelekea mtu kufungwa hadi miaka 10 au kulipa milioni 30; Sasa kama mtu kaweka picha yake Instagram ambayo sio ya ponografia lakini ‘ikatafsiriwa’ hivyo.	four, clause 14: any picture that gives any inclination that it can be viewed as 'pornographic' can cause someone to be jailed for years or to pay 30 million shillings; even if someone posts a picture of themselves on Instagram which is not pornographic but is 'interpreted' as such.
<12>	Sheria haijatafsiri ponografia!	the law has not defined pornography!
<13>	Tano, Kifungu 23: Je, ulijua kuwa ‘kusababisha maudhi ya hisia’ kwa mtu mwingine ni unyanyasaji na unaweza kufungwa kifungo kisichopungua mwaka mmoja?	five, clause 23: did you know that 'causing emotional nuisance' to someone else is harassment and you can be jailed for a term not exceeding one year?
<14>	Sita, Rejea adhabu ya ibara mbalimbali: Sheria hii kila kosa linaweza fanya mtu afungwe kifungo hadi cha maisha na kulipa pesa hadi zisizohesabika kwani hakijawekwa kikomo cha juu cha adhabu bali kikomo cha chini tu kwa Kiingereza “not less than”	six, refer to punishment of various clauses: according to this law, every offense can cause someone to be jailed for a term of up to life and pay monies that cannot even be counted since it has not put a cap on the punishment but has only put the minimum and only in English, "no less than".
<15>	Saba, Sheria haijaeleza vizuri suala la kutumia jina lisilo lako kwenye mtandao na hivyo mtu anaweza kushitakiwa kama kuna mtu mwingine mwenye jina kama hilo katika maisha halisi.	seven, the law has not explained well the issue of using a name that is not yours on the Internet and thus someone might be sued if there is someone else with such a name in real life.
<16>	Nane, Serikali kupitia waziri husika ndio ina mamlaka ya kusema jambo lililowekwa kwenye mtandao ni la kweli, uongo au la kupotosha.	eight, the government, through the relevant ministry, is the one with the authority to say if something posted on the Internet is true, false or misleading.
<17>	Kumbuka hata ESCROW, EPA walisema ni uwongo; ni wangapi katika mtandao wangeshtakiwa kiuonevu kwa hili?	remember when they said that even ESCROW, EPA was false; how many would have been maliciously prosecuted because of this?
<18>	Tisa, Kifungu 22: Ukiweka ujumbe katika mtandao na ukaufuta au kuuboresha, kama ukishtakiwa kwa kuweka ujumbe huo unaweza kuhukumiwa pia kwa adhabu ya kuuboresha au kuufuta.	nine, clause 22: if you post a message on the Internet and delete or edit it, if you are prosecuted for posting the message you can also be convicted for editing and deleting it.
<19>	Ni mara ngapi unafuta ‘status’ zako za WhatsApp?	how many of your 'statuses' do you delete on WhatsApp?
<20>	Unaweza shtakiwa kwa kuchelewesha ushahidi kisa tu ulifuta na hamna mtu anayeweza kujua ulifuta kwa kusudi au la.	you can be prosecuted for delaying evidence just because you deleted it and there is no one who is able to know if you did it intentionally or not.
<21>	Kumi, Mkuu wa kituo cha Polisi chochote kile nchini anaweza kuagiza wewe umpatie simu/laptop yako au taarifa zako zote (kwenye email, chats) au hata vifaa vyako au ofisi yako kwa ajili ya upelelezi bila oda ya Mahakama.	ten, any officer in charge of any police station in the country can order you to give him your phone/laptop or your all statements (on email, chats) or even your equipment or access to your office for investigation purposes, without even having a court order.
<22>	Kumi na moja, Kifungu 31 (3a): “As soon as practicable” the law states.	eleven, clause 31 (3a): "as soon as practicable" the law states.
<23>	Askari Polisi wakichukua vitu vyako wanaweza kukupatia listi ya vitu walivyovipokea muda watakaoona kwao inawezekana kufanya hivyo.	when the police take your things, they can give you a list of the things they received in a period they will see is possible to do so.
<24>	Jiulize, inaweza chukua muda gani?	ask yourself, how long can it take?"
<25>	Kumi na mbili, Kifungu 31-35 & 39-45: Kama wewe ni Blogger au mtoa huduma ya mtandao, pale unapobaini kosa ukalitoa na uko katika mikakati ya kuitaarifu mamlaka husika (Kama sheria inavyosema),	twelve, clause 31-35 and 39-45: if you are a blogger or an Internet service provider, when you establish a mistake and remove it and you are in the process of informing the relevant authorities (as the law states),
<26>	askari naye anaweza kwa wakati huohuo akaja kukagua na kuchukua vitu vya kazi zako, hivyo sheria inakinzana yenyewe kwa yenyewe.	a police officer can at the same time come and inspect and take your work equipment, and so the law contradicts itself.
<27>	Blogger yuko sawa kisheria na askari yuko sawa kisheria.	the blogger is right legally and the police officer is right legally.
<28>	Je, sheria hii ikisainiwa na Rais Jakaya Kikwete tutapona?	if this law is signed by President Jakaya Kikwete, will we survive?
