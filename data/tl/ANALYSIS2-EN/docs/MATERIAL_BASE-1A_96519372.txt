<4>	SERIKALI imeshauriwa kutokaa kimya kuhusu chanzo cha vifo vya watu saba ambao miili yao ilikutwa katika mifuko ya sandarusi katika kingo za Mto Ruvu, wilayani Bagamoyo, Pwani.	the government has been advised not to stay silent about the cause of death of seven people whose bodies were found inside resin bags on the shores of River Ruvu, Bagamoyo District, Coast.
<5>	Aidha imeelezwa kuwa mazingira ya kutatanisha ya kupotea kwa mfanyakazi wa ofisi ya Chama cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo (Chadema), Benard Saanane lazima kutazamwe.	furthermore, it was explained that the conflicting conditions of the disappearance of the employee of the Party of Democracy and Development (Chadema), Benard Saanane, must be looked into.
<6>	Hayo yamesemwa na Mwenyekiti wa Umoja wa Kizazi cha Kuhoji Tanzania (UTG), Malisa Godlisten jana jijini Dar es Salaam alipozungumza na waandishi wa habari kuhusu matukio hayo.	this was announced by the chairperson of the Union of the Generation to Examine Tanzania (UTG), Malisa Godlisten yesterday in Dar es Salaam City when he spoke to journalists about the incidents.
<7>	Alisema serikali kwa kushirikiana na taasisi zake ikiwemo wizara hiyo ya Mambo ya Ndani ya Nchi, Wizara ya Afya, Maendeleo ya Jamii, Jinsia, Wazee na Watoto na Ofisi ya Mkemia Mkuu inapaswa kuratibu kazi ya kufukuliwa kwa miili ya watu hao saba iliyookotwa na kuzikwa eneo la Mto Ruvu, ili kupata sampuli zitakazotumika kutambua ndugu wa marehemu watakapojitokeza na chanzo cha vifo hivyo.	he said that the government, in conjunction with its institutions, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Health, the Development of Society, the Elderly and Children and the Office of the Chief Chemist, should coordinate the work of exhuming the bodies of the seven people who were killed and buried in the area of River Ruvu, in order to get samples that will be used to recognize the dead people's families when they come forward and to determine the motive behind the deaths.
<8>	Miili ya watu sita ilikutwa Desemba 7 mwaka huu kando ya mto Ruvu wilayani humo ndani ya mifuko ya sandarusi na ndani ikiwa imewekwa mawe ili isielee kisha mifuko hiyo kushonwa kama mzigo wa mazao na kutupwa mtoni.	the bodies of six people were found on December 7th this year on the banks of the River Ruvu in the district, inside resin bags with stones put inside so they would not float, the bags having then been sewn together like harvest bags and thrown into the river.
<9>	Mwili mwingine uliokotwa Desemba 9 mwaka huu eneo hilo hilo na pamoja na kutokuwa katika mfuko wa sarandusi, ulikuwa umevuliwa shati na kuonekana na majeraha mgongoni na kwenye ubavu umekatwa na kitu chenye ncha kali.	another body was discovered on December 9th this year in the same area but was not inside a resin bag, and the shirt had been stripped off, with with injuries on the back and a cut on the rib cage caused by something sharp.
<10>	Mwishoni mwa wiki, Kamanda wa Polisi Mkoa wa Pwani, Boniventure Mushongi alisema miili yote ilizikwa kwa kuwa ilikuwa vigumu kuwatambua kutokana na kuharibika vibaya huku kukiwa hakuna kitambulisho chochote kinachoashiria watu hao ni nani na wametoka wapi na kwamba Polisi inaendelea na upelelezi kubaini waliohusika na mauaji hayo, atakayebainika sheria itachukua mkondo wake.	towards the end of the week, the police commander of Coast Province, Boniventure Mushongi, said all the bodies must have been buried because it was hard to identify them from the bad decomposition and there were no identifications to show who the people were and where they were from, and that police are continuing with the investigations to determine who was involved in the killings. the law will take its course on whoever is found to be involved.
<11>	Aidha kuhusu kupotea kwa Saanane, Godlisten alisema UTG inaipa Chadema saa 72 kutoa taarifa ya kupotea kwa Saanane aliyeondoka nyumbani kwake Novemba 18 mwaka huu hadi leo hii hajaonekana wala taarifa zake kutolewa sehemu yoyote.	additionally, when speaking about the disappearance of Saanane, Godlisten said UTG is giving Chadema 72 hours to provide reports about the disappearance of Saanane, who left his home on 18th November this year and until now has not been seen again, nor have sightings been reported anywhere.
<12>	Alisema tukio la kupotea kwa Saanane aliyekuwa akifanya kazi Makao Makuu ya Chadema, Dar es Salaam, lilianza kuibua mijadala kuanzia Novemba 26 mwaka huu baada ya kutoonekana nyumbani kwake Tabata na eneo lake la kazi.	he said the incident of the disappearance of Saanane, who used to work at the headquarters of Chadema, Dar es Salaam, started to arouse discussions from November 26th this year, after he was missing from his home in Tabata and his work area.
<13>	Alisema akiwa Katibu wa umoja wao huo, baada ya kutojulikana alipo wakishirikiana na familia yake walikwenda eneo alilokuwa akifanyia kazi na kuulizia, baada ya kukosa taarifa walitoa taarifa Makao Makuu ya Polisi na kituo cha Polisi Tabata, Desemba 5 mwaka huu na kupewa RB namba TBT/RB/8150/2016, ambapo pamoja na mambo mengine walipewa ruhusa ya kumtafuta maeneo mbalimbali.	he said that as he was the secretary of the union, and did not know of his whereabouts, and his family also did not know, they went to the place he worked and asked them. when they still had no information, they made a report at the police headquarters in Tabata Police Station on December 5th this year and gave the RB number TBT/RB/8150/2160, where, together with other things, they were given permission to look for him in various areas.
<14>	Alisema walianza kumtafuta maeneo mbalimbali ya Dar es Salaam ikiwemo hospitali za Amana, Temeke, Mwananyamala na Hospitali ya Taifa Muhimbili, walipewa ushirikiano wa kutosha kwa kukagua vyumba vya wagonjwa mahututi, orodha ya wagonjwa waliolazwa wasiotambulika na katika nyumba za kuhifadhi maiti bila mafanikio.	he said they started looking for him in various areas in Dar es Salaam, including hospitals like Amana, Temeke, Mwananyamala and Muhimbili National Hospital. they were given enough cooperation by checking the rooms of unconscious patients, a list of unidentified admitted patients and in mortuaries without success.
<15>	Alisema baada ya kumkosa walitoa mrejesho polisi na kuomba wawasiliane na vituo vyao ili kujua kama ameshikiliwa mahabusu wakaambiwa hajashikiliwa wakaomba kujiridhisha kwa kupita katika vituo hivyo na kuvikagua.	he said after he was still not found, they gave feedback to police and asked them to communicate with their other stations to find out if he was being held prisoner and they were told he wasn't being held. they requested permission to confirm this by going to those stations to examine them.
<16>	“Kati ya Desemba 6 na 7 mwaka huu tukapita na kukagua mahabusu katika vituo vyote vikubwa vya Polisi jijini Dar es Salaam vikiwemo Kituo cha Polisi Oysterbay, Mabatini, Urafiki, Magomeni, Buguruni, Chang’ombe na kiutuo cha polisi Sitaki Shari lakini hatukufanikiwa kumpata katika vituo hivyo, wala hakuwemo katika orodha ya mahabusu waliowahi kufikishwa katika vituo hivyo,” alisema.	"between December 6th and 7th this year we went and examined prisoners at all the big police stations in Dar es Salaam City, including Oysterbay Police Station, Mabatini, Urafiki, Magomeni, Buguruni, Chang'ombe and Sitaki Shari Police Station, but we did not find him in those stations, nor was he among the list of prisoners who had ever been brought to those stations," he said.
<17>	Godlisten alisema baada ya hapo walienda kuuliza katika magereza mawili jijini Dar es Salaam yanayohifadhi mahabusu la Segerea na Keko bila mafanikio.	Godlisten said that after that they went to ask two prisons in Dar es Salaam that hold prisoners in Segerea and Keko, without success.
<18>	Vile vile Ofisi za Uhamiaji Uwanja wa Ndege jijini Dar ili kujua kama amekwenda nje ya nchi wakagundua hajasafiri nje ya nchi.	likewise, they asked immigration offices at the airport in Dar City whether he had traveled outside the country and found out that he hadn't traveled outside the country.
<19>	Alisema ili kujiridhisha zaidi walikwenda Mamlaka ya Mawasiliano Tanzania (TCRA), ili wapate taarifa za mawasiliano ya mwisho ya Saanane kuwasaidia kutambua alipo huko wakaelezwa jukumu hilo ni la kampuni ya simu kupitia jeshi la polisi hivyo polisi inapaswa kuandika barua TCRA kuomba taarifa hizo.	he said that in order to confirm this, they went to the Tanzania Communications Authority (TRCA) to get information on the last communication by Saanane, to help them know where he is, and they were told that the responsibility lies with the phone company, through the police force, and therefore the police are supposed to write a letter to TCRA to request that information.
<20>	Alisema polisi walichukua maelezo upya ya tukio hilo na kuahidi kuandika barua hiyo kwenye mtandao husika wa simu ili kupata mawasiliano hayo, lakini hadi sasa hawajapata mawasiliano hayo.	he said that the police took new details of that incident and promised to write the letter to the concerned phone network to obtain that communication, but as of now they have not received that communication.
<21>	Alisema baada ya jitihada zote hizo kufanyika bila mafanikio, Desemba 8 mwaka huu ziliripotiwa taarifa za kuokotwa kwa miili ya watu huko Bagamoyo eneo la mto Ruvu, ambapo walisafiri kwenda kujiridhisha kama yupo miongoni mwa maiti hizo, lakini walikuta miili yote imeshazikwa bila kuacha kielelezo chochote.	he said that after all the efforts carried out without success, on December 8th this year, information was reported about the bodies of people discovered in Bagamoyo area of Ruvu, and they traveled there to ascertain if he was among the corpses, but they found that all the bodies had been buried without leaving behind any information.
<22>	Alisema wanasikitika kuona vifo vya watanzania vikipewa uzito mdogo na taasisi zenye wajibu wa kushughulikia jambo hilo.	he said that they are shocked to see the deaths of Tanzanians given little weight by the institutions with the responsibility of dealing with the matter.
<23>	“Ni ajabu hadi kamati ya ulinzi na usalama mkoa wa Pwani haijachukua hatua zinazoridhisha juu ya jambo kubwa kama hili.	"it is a shock that the security and safety committee in the Coast Province has not taken satisfactory measures on an important matter like this one.
<24>	Taarifa tuliyoipewa kutoka ofisi ya kata inaeleza kuwa hadi kufikia tarehe 10 mwezi huu hakuna kiongozi yeyote wa serikali kuu aliyekuwa amefika eneo hilo.	the information we were given from the ward office explains that up to the 10th of this month, there was no central government leader who had gone to the place.
<25>	Si waziri, mkuu wa mkoa wa Pwani wala mbunge wa eneo husika,” alisema.	neither a minister, the head of Coast Province, nor the parliamentarian of the concerned area," he said.
