<1>	Mfumo mpya wa Yanga ni wa kuigwa kwa tahadhari	Yanga's system is to be copied cautiously.
<2>	Kwa kipindi kirefu, soka la hapa nchini limekuwa likitawaliwa na sintofahamu za kiuongozi, kadhaa zikitokana na mazingira lakini nyingi zikiwa ni matokeo ya mfumo mbovu ambao huwapa nguvu watu wasio na weledi kwenye utawala wa michezo.	for a long time, the soccer here in the country has been governed by various leadership frustrations resulting from the conditions, although many are a result of a bad system which gives power to people with no skills in sports governance.
<3>	Ni hivi majuzi tu klabu ya Yanga ya Dar es Salaam ilijaribu kufanya mabadiliko makubwa ya kiutawala na kiutendaji, mabadiliko ambayo yalihusisha uundaji wa nafasi kadhaa mpya ndani ya taasisi hiyo kubwa kwenye soka.	it was only the other day that the Yanga Club from Dar es Salaam tried to make big administrative and execution changes, the changes involving the creation of several new positions inside the big institution in soccer.
<4>	Miongoni mwa mabadiliko waliyoyafanya ni pamoja na kuasisi nafasi za Mtendaji Mkuu wa Klabu na Mkurugenzi wa Ufundi, nafasi ambazo ni ngeni sana kwenye utendaji wa klabu zetu.	among the changes they made are, together with establishing the positions of executive director of the club and technical director, positions which are very new in our club operations.
<5>	Kwa vyovyote vile, hii ni mara ya kwanza kwa klabu ya Tanzania, walau Ligi Bara kufanya mageuzi ya kimfumo ya aina hii ambayo kwa bahati mbaya yamefunikwa na sakata la ukodishwaji wa klabu ya Yanga ambalo limeteka mioyo ya wadau kuliko mabadiliko ninayoyarejea.	in any case, this is the first time for a Tanzanian club, at least for the mainland league, to make system changes of this kind which unfortunately have been concealed by the saga of the Yanga Club lease, which has captured the hearts of stakeholders more than the changes I am referring to.
<6>	Klabu ya Azam ni miongoni mwa klabu ambazo zilijaribu kuja na aina tofauti ya uendeshaji wa masuala ya kiufundi, lakini kwa sababu zilizo nje ya uwezo wao wakajikuta wanaamini mifumo ya klabu vya wanachama ambayo tumeizoea.	the Azam Club is among the clubs which have tried to come up with a different way to run technical issues, but, because of reasons outside their ability, have found themselves believing in systems of member clubs which we're used to.
<7>	Kufukuza makocha/wachezaji na kushiriki zinazoitwa `fitina'za mpira ni miongoni mwa mambo ambayo yalifanya juhudi za mabadiliko za Azam FC kuwa kazi bure, kwa sasa mwenendo wa Azam na klabu nyingine za wanachama hautofautiani sana.	dismissing coaches/players and participating in football gossip are among issues which resulted in Azam FC's efforts to change a waste of time and currently, Azam's conduct is not any different from other member clubs.
<8>	Ndio, hawatofautiani sana kwa kuwa ujio wa Azam ulikuwa wa kisasa, miundombinu ya kisasa, jopo la makocha na wataalamu kutoka nje na hata uwanjani walionesha nidhamu ya tofauti.	yes, they do not differ much because Azam's entry was political, the infrastructure was political, the panel of coaches and experts were from outside and they even portrayed a different discipline in the field.
<9>	Miaka kadha baada ya kujifunza `kuishi na Waroma' ikawa si ajabu kusikia viongozi wa timu hiyo wakiingia kambi ya timu ya taifa kujaribu kusainisha wachezaji kinyemela na huo ukawa mwanzo wa mwisho wa utaalamu na usasa wao.	several years after learning how to leave with the Romans, it wasn't shocking to hear the officials of that team going into the national team's camp to try and sign up players secretly, and that was the beginning and end of their expertise and their hunt.
<10>	Si Azam pekee ambao wame jikuta wakiishia kuishi namna linavyotaka soka letu, zipo timu na watu ambao walikuja na ari zaidi lakini wakaishia kukata tamaa, Alex Kajumulo na Kajumulo World Soccer ni mfano hai kabisa wa namna ambavyo mfumo wetu unaweza kuangusha ndoto na mipango ya kisasa.	it's not only Azam who have found themselves operating as our soccer requires, there are other teams and people who came with more zeal but ended up giving up. Alex Kajumulo and Kajumulo World Soccer is a very real example of how our system can ruin dreams and modern plans.
<11>	Yanga nao wamekuwa na mipango yao ya uongo na kweli, ya kwenye makaratasi na `press conference', likiwemo suala la maboresho ya Uwanja wa Kaunda na makao makuu ya klabu hiyo mtaa wa Jangwani.	Yanga have also had their fake and genuine plans on paper and press conferences, among them the issue of renovating Kaunda Stadium and the club's headquarters in the Jangwani neighborhood.
<12>	Sakata la kukodishwa kwa nembo ya klabu limezua mgawanyiko na kuhatarisha ustawi wa timu hiyo, pengine kwa miaka kadhaa ijayo, lakini katikati ya vuguvugu hilo kuna mabadilko ambayo yameanza kufanyiwa kazi.	the club's logo lease saga has aroused division and endangered the stability of the team for potentially the next several years, but amidst the confusion, there are changes that are being worked on.
<13>	Mabadiliko haya si porojo kama za Uwanja wa Kaunda, tayari wamejitutumua na kusajili mmoja wa makocha bora kabisa barani Afrika kwa sasa na wanae Mkurugenzi wa Ufundi ambaye ni mwanachama anayeifahamu vema klabu hiyo, kisiasa na kiufundi.	these changes are not idle talks like the ones about Kaunda Stadium because they have already strained and signed up one of the best coaches in Africa for now and they have a technical director who is also a member who understands the club well, politically and technically.
<14>	Tayari Yanga wameshaonja chungu ya wanachotaka kukifanya, aliyetarajiwa kuwa Mtendaji Mkuu wa klabu, Jerome Douforg hayupo tena kwa sababu ambazo hazieleweki, zikihusishwa na sekeseke la ukodishwaji wa nembo.	Yanga have already tasted the pot on what they want to do. Jerome Douforg, who was expected to be the club's executive director, is no longer there for reasons that are not clear, but is associated with the logo lease saga.
<15>	Hata kama Yanga wasipofikia matarajio yao, bado uongozi wao wa sasa utakuwa umeacha jambo la kujifunza kwenye mfumo wetu wa soka, tofauti na hisia za wakosoaji wengi kuwa timu za wanachama haziwezi kubadilika.	even if Yanga will not reach its expectations, its current leadership will have left a lesson for our soccer system, in contrast with the sentiments of many critics that member clubs can't change.
<16>	Si ajabu klabu nyingine za wanachama zikaiga mfumo huu mpya wa Yanga endapo utaonyesha mafanikio, na hapa ndipo panapotakiwa tahadhari kwani uendeshaji wa klabu za wanachama umetawaliwa na siasa, na masuala ya kiufundi hayawezi katu kwenda na aina ya siasa ambazo tunazishuhudia kwenye klabu na hata timu ya taifa.	it won't be surprising for other clubs to copy this new system by Yanga if it succeeds, and this is where caution is needed since the running of member clubs is governed by politics and technical issues, by no means, can go with the type of politics we are witnessing in the clubs and even the national team.
