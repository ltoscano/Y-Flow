<4>	MKUU wa Mkoa wa Kilimanjaro, Saidi Mecky Sadiki amesema Wakala za Ufundi na Umeme Nchini (TEMESA) ni mzigo kutokana na kushindwa kufanya kazi zake kwa ubora unaokubalika huku ikitoza gharama kubwa za matengenezo ya magari bila sababu za msingi.	the head of Kilimanjaro Province, Saidi Mecky Sadiki, said the Technical and Electrical Agency of the country (TEMESA) is a burden due to its inability to do its work to acceptable standards, and charging high costs for vehicle repairs without good reason.
<5>	Aidha, wakala huo chini ya Wizara ya Ujenzi umedaiwa kutokuwa na mafundi na vipuri stahili vya magari na badala yake imekuwa wakala wa karakana kubwa za magari zinazomilikiwa na watu binafsi.	furthermore, the agency under the Ministry of Housing apparently has no technicians nor the required vehicle spare parts, and instead has become a workshop agency for big cars that are owned by private people.
<6>	Sadiki aliyasema hayo juzi wakati akijibu hoja za baadhi ya watumishi wa Halmashauri ya Wilaya ya Siha mkoani hapa, walioelezea kutoridhishwa na kazi inayofanywa na Temesa.	Sadiki said this the day before yesterday, when responding to a topic from some workers of the Siha District Municipal here in the province, who explained their dissatisfaction with the work being done by TEMESA.
<7>	“Siyo ninyi tu mnaokerwa na Temesa, hii ni idara chini ya serikali, lakini hatuoni nafasi yao, kwanza gharama zao za utengenezaji wa magari ni kubwa mno, hawana vipuri huku bado gari wanayotengeneza hayana uhakika wa kutengemaa,” alisema.	"you are not the only ones who are annoyed by TEMESA, the department is under the government yet we don't see their position, in fact their costs for vehicle repairs are very high, they have no spare parts and there's no assurance that the cars they are repairing will be normal," he said.
<8>	Alisema mara kadhaa magari ya serikali yanayopelekwa Temesa hawatengenezi wenyewe ila nao hupeleka katika karakana kubwa zilizopo baadhi ya maeneo mkoani hapa, jambo linaloongeza gharama za matengenezo.	he said many times that government vehicles taken there are not repaired by TEMESA itself, but taken to bigger garages elsewhere in the province, which increases the cost of repair.
<9>	Hata hivyo, amesema ana uhakika wizara ya ujenzi imeiona changamoto hiyo, kwani kinyume na hapo ni kuishushia heshima serikali na kuongeza gharama.	he said, however, that he is sure the Ministry of Housing has seen the challenge, otherwise it is lowering the respect for the government and increasing the cost.
<10>	“Kuna wakati nilikuta mzozo baina ya Mamlaka ya Mapato Nchini (TRA) waliokuwa wanadaiwa takribani Sh milioni 20 na Temesa baada ya kutengeneza gari lao licha ya kwamba gari lenyewe halikufanikiwa kufika eneo la Holili uliko mpaka kati ya Tanzania na Kenya,” alisema.	"there was a time I found a dispute between the Revenue Authority in the country (TRA), who owed TEMESA approximately 20 million shillings after repairing their vehicle, despite the fact that the said vehicle did not manage to get to the Holili area at the border of Tanzania and Kenya," he said.
<11>	Kauli ya mkuu wa mkoa inafuatia swali la mtumishi wa halmashauri hiyo, John Maimu aliyetaka serikali kuitupia macho Temesa kwa madai inagharama kubwa licha ya kutokuwa na uwezo wa kufanya matengenezo stahili ya magari ya umma.	the statement by the Governor followed a question by a council worker, John Maimu, who wanted the government to observe TEMESA, after allegations of being expensive despite not having the ability to conduct the required repairs on public vehicles.
