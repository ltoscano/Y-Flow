<2>	KUTUNZA MAZINGIRA KUNAVYOONGEZA UMRI WA KUISHI	how caring for the environment prolongs life expectancy.
<3>	Na ADAM MKWEPU-DAR ES SALAAM	by Adam Mkwepu, Dar es Salaam.
<4>	MALIASILI nchini ni chanzo kikubwa cha ustawi wa maisha ya wananchi na ni uti wa mgongo wa sekta kuu za uzalishaji kama vile kilimo, utalii, uvuvi na madini.	a country's natural resources is a big source of stability of citizens' lives and it is the backbone of the major production sectors like agriculture, tourism, fishing and minerals.
<5>	Uhusiano baina ya ukuaji wa uchumi na usimamizi wa mazingira na maliasili umetiliwa mkazo katika sera ya Taifa ya Mazingira na Mkakati wa Kukuza Uchumi na Kuondoa Umaskini Tanzania (MKUKUTA).	the relationship between the growth of the economy and the management of the environment and natural resources has been emphasized in the national environment policy and the economic growth and poverty eradication strategy in Tanzania (MKUKUTA).
<6>	Ili sekta yoyote iweze kuendesha shughuli zake kwa ufanisi, ni lazima iwe na utaratibu uliojiwekea katika kuendesha shughuli zilizopangwa ili kufikia malengo yaliyowekwa.	for any sector to run its operations effectively, it must have procedures put in place to drive the planned operations so that the set goals are reached.
<7>	Moja ya taratibu zilizowekwa ni pamoja na sera, sheria na kanuni zake ambazo hutoa mwelekeo thabiti wa kutunza mazingira na kuenzi rasilimali nchini.	one of the set procedures has combined policies, rules and its regulations to give firm direction about protecting the environment and honoring a country's resources.
<8>	Maliasili ni sekta pana inayojumuisha sekta mbalimbali kama kilimo, ufugaji, afya, madini, viwanda, nishati, maji, utalii, misitu, uvuvi, pamoja na wanyamapori ambazo pia zina sera, sheria na kanuni zake.	use of natural resources is a wide sector which includes various sectors like agriculture, breeding, health, minerals, industries, energy, water, tourism, forests, fishing together with wildlife which also has policies, rules and its regulations.
<9>	Ofisa Miradi wa Taasisi ya Utunzaji Mazingira (Agenda), Fatma Msuya anasema kila mmoja kwa nafasi yake anatakiwa ashiriki kikamilifu katika kuhifadhi mazingira kulingana na sheria zinavyoelekeza.	the project officer of Environmental Management Institute (Agenda), Fatma Msuya, says everyone in his capacity is required to participate fully in conserving the environment according to the direction of the law.
<10>	“Faida ya moja kwa moja tunayopata kwa kutunza mazingira vizuri ni kuongeza umri wa kuishi katika ulimwengu huu tulionao.	"the direct benefit that we are getting from conserving the environment well is prolonging our life expectancy in the world we have.
<11>	“Maisha yetu yamekuwa mafupi kwa sababu tumeharibu mazingira.	our lives have become short because we have destroyed the environment.
<12>	Kuna uhusiano mkubwa kati ya umri wa maisha yetu na uhifadhi wa mazingira,” anasema Fatuma na kuongeza kuwa maisha yetu yanakuwa mafupi kwa sababu tuna kula vitu visivyo na ubora na ambavyo havijengi mwili bali kuharibu mwili.	there is a relationship between our life expectancy and the conservation of the environment," says Fatuma, adding that our lives are becoming shorter because we are eating low quality things which do not build but destroy the body.
<13>	Fatuma anasema kuwa vyakula hivyo havina ubora kwa kuwa ardhi inayotoa hayo mazao imeharibiwa na shughuli za binadamu.	Fatuma says that those foods lack quality because the earth which produces the harvest has been destroyed through human activities.
<14>	Naye Ofisa Miradi Mwandamizi ambaye pia ni Katibu Mtendaji wa AGENDA, Haji Rehani anasema ufuatiliaji ni nyenzo muhimu katika kuweka kumbukumbu za matatizo yanayotokea kwenye jamii.	the project supervising officer who is also the acting executive of AGENDA, Haji Rehani, says monitoring is an important tool to save records of problems which occur in the community.
<15>	Rehani anasisitiza jamii na kamati za mazingira pamoja na maafisa watendaji wa kata na vijiji, kuwa na mazoea ya kufunya ufuatiliaji wa maliasili zao na mazingira ili kubaini ukubwa wa matatizo.	Rehani insists communities and environmental committees, together with executive officers of wards and villages, have a habit of monitoring their natural resources and the environment so as to reveal the extent of the problems.
<16>	Kwa upande wake Mkuu wa Kitengo cha Elimu ya Mazingira wa Baraza la Taifa la Uhifadhi wa Mazingira (NEMC), Carlos Mbuta anasema hatuna budi kutekeleza sheria na kanuni zake katika kuendeleza rasilimali za nchi yetu kwa kuzielekeza kwenye programu sahihi za hifadhi ya mazingira.	on his side, the head of the Environmental Education Department of the National Environment Management Council (NEMC), Carlos Mbuta, says we have no choice but to implement these rules and its regulations for sustaining our country's resources by directing them to the correct environment conservation program.
<17>	“Elimu, uhamasishaji na matumizi ya sheria ni njia zenye nafasi kubwa katika kuinua kiwango cha mafanikio ya shughuli za hifadhi ya mazingira, hivyo ni muhimu zisimamiwe na viongozi wote.	"education, sensitization and the use of laws are the ways which have a huge chance of increasing the success of environment conservation activities, and so it is important for all leaders to supervise them.
<18>	“Maafisa mazingira katika ngazi mbalimbali ni watendaji wakuu wanaosimamia mazingira na ni tegemeo la Serikali na wananchi kwa ujumla katika kuitekeleza sheria na kuwa na mazingira bora kwa kila Mtanzania,” anasema Mbuta.	environment officers in various levels are chief executives managing the environment and they are pillars to the government and the citizens in general, in implementing the law to get a better environment for every Tanzanian," says Mbuta.
<19>	Akizungumzia hali ya utunzaji mazingira na maliasili iliyoko Visiwani Mafia, Ofisa Mazingira wa Wilaya ya Mafia, Gideon Zakayo anasema visababishi vya uharibifu wa mazingira viko vingi ikiwamo uharibifu wa matumbawe, mikoko, uchafuzi, maeneo ya ukanda wa pwani na bahari, bionuwai za bahari utokanao na uvuvi usio endelevu.	while speaking about the state of protecting the environment and natural resources in Mafia Islands, the environment officer of Mafia District, Gideon Zakayo, says there are many causes of environmental destruction, including the destruction of coral, mangroves, pollution along the coastal region and oceans areas and oceanic biodiversity that result from unsustainable fishing.
<20>	“Uharibifu huo pia umeikumba hadi viumbe wa baharini walio hatarini kutoweka kama kasa, pomboo nguva na silikanti,” anasema Zakayo.	"the destruction has also affected sea creatures who are in danger of extinction like turtles, dolphins and coelacanths," says Zakayo.
<21>	Zakayo anatoa mifano ya maeneo yenye athari za wanyapori katika wilaya hiyo, akisema Mafia kwa sasa inasumbuliwa na viboko ambao pia wako hatarini kutoweka kwa kasi zaidi katika visiwa hivyo.	Zakayo gave examples of the areas with wildlife effects in the district, saying currently Mafia is troubled by hippos who are also in danger of rapid extinction in those islands.
<22>	Mwaka jana, jumla ya viboko watatu wameuawa katika vijiji vitatu tofauti ambavyo ni Kirongwe, Ndagoni na Dongo.	last year, a total of three hippos were killed in three different villages of Kirongwe, Ndagoni and Dongo.
<23>	Viboko hao walikuwa wakivamia mashamba ya watu.	the hippos were invading people's farms.
<24>	Hivyo, kujikuta ndani ya miaka 3 jumla ya viboko sita wameuawa.	in this way, within 3 years, a total of 6 hippos have been killed.
<25>	Kwa Wilaya ya Mafia, viboko wanapatikana katika vijiji vya Ndagoni, Chunguruma na Kirongwe na katika vijiji hivi kuna mabwawa ya asili zaidi ya 40 ambayo maji hayakauki na yamekuwa makazi mazuri kwa bioanuai.	for the district of Mafia, hippos are found in the villages of Ndagoni, Chunguruma and Kirongwe and in these villages, there are more than 40 traditional dams where water never runs dry and they have been a good residence for biodiversity.
<26>	Hadi sasa, hakuna sensa iliyofanyika kujua idadi ya viboko waliopo Mafia hata hivyo, ukiachana na suala la viboko, pia uchomaji moto misitu katika visiwa vya Mafia umekithiri ambapo uchomaji huo ni kwa ajili ya maandalizi ya mashamba inayoleta athari kubwa kwa mazingira na mali za watu kushika moto.	until now, there's no census which has taken place to know the number of hippos in Mafia and if so, when you put aside the issue of hippos, the burning of forests in the Mafia Islands has increased and is done for the purpose of preparing farms which brings extreme effects to the environment and people's properties also burning.
<27>	Ofisa uvuvi wa Halmashauri ya Mafia, Subira Muya anasisitiza kuwa kuna umuhimu wa kila kijiji kuwa na sheria ndogondogo ili kuhakikisha usimamizi salama wa mazingira na maliasili kwa vizazi vijavyo.	the Mafia municipal's fishing officer, Subira Muya, insists that there is an importance for every village to have small laws in order to ensure safer management of the environment and natural resources for future generations.
