<3>	CHAMA cha riadha (AK) tawi la Nyanza Kaskazini kimeonya kuwa hakitaruhusu mashindano yoyote nje ya kalenda yake haswa wakati huu wa sherehe za Krismasi na mwaka mpya.	the Athletics Association (AK) Nyanza North branch has warned that it will not allow any competition outside the calendar especially during the period of Christmas and New Year celebrations.
<4>	Mwenyekiti wa tawi hilo Joseph Ochieng’ ameliambia Taifa Leo kuwa mbio za nyika za kila mwaka za Rusinga zimefutiliwa mbali baada ya waandalizi kufeli kuwasiliana na afisi yake kwa wakati ufaao.	the chairperson of the branch, Joseph Ochieng, has told Nation Today that the Rusinga annual cross country races have been dismissed after the organizers failed to communicate with his office in good time.
<5>	“Mashindano ya Rusinga hayapo mwaka huu na wajibu wetu kama afisi ni kuwalinda wanariadha dhidi ya walaghai wanaotaka kuwapunja,” alisema Ochieng’ Aliongeza kuwa mmoja wa waandalizi Ken Onyonyi amekuwa akiwachenga maafisa wake tangu makala hayo yalipoandaliwa mwezi desemba mwaka jana na ameripotiwa kuwa nchini Afrika Kusini.	"the Rusinga competitions are not happening this year and our duty as an office is to protect the athletes against fraudsters who want to fleece them," said Ochieng. he added that one of the organizers, Ken Onyonyi, has been dodging their officers since the sessions were organized in December last year and he is reported to be in South Africa.
<6>	Onyonyi anadaiwa kupokea takriban Sh3 millioni kutoka kwa wadhamini kwa matayarisho ya mbio za mwaka jana na akafeli kuwatuza washindi.	Onyonyi is alleged to have received approximately 3 million shillings from sponsors for the preparations of last year's races and failed to award the winners.
<7>	“Mwanariadha Joseph Okelo alimaliza wa kwanza na kushinda piki piki na mwaka mmoja baadae hajapata zawadi yake.	athlete Joseph Okelo finished first and won a motorbike and a year on he has not received his prize.
<8>	Kama washika dau wa riadha tunatataka kukomesha mkondo huu ambao unazidi kushika kasi,” alionya.	"as athletics stakeholders, we want to stop this trend which is continuing to gain momentum quickly," he warned.
