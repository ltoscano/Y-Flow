<2>	BINADAMU yeyote anahitaji kuishi maisha bora na yenye tija ikiwa ni pamoja na kuepuka majanga mbalimbali.	any human being needs to live a better and productive life which includes avoiding various disasters.
<3>	Ajali na maradhi ni kati ya majanga yanayowapata binadamu na wakati mwingine ikawa vigumu kuyazuia kutokana na asili yake.	accidents and illnesses are among the disasters that attack human beings and they can sometimes be difficult to prevent as a result of their nature.
<4>	Lakini je, ni namna gani binadamu anatakiwa kujipanga kukabiliana na hali kama hiyo inapotokea?	but how is a human being supposed to organize themselves to deal with such a situation when it comes up?
<5>	Kampuni ya simu za mkononi ya Tigo inatajwa kuwa na sifa moja kubwa ambayo ni ubunifu.	the Tigo cell phone company is mentioned to have one main quality which is innovation.
<6>	Sifa hiyo huenda imeipa jina kubwa kibiashara na kujipatia watumiaji wengi wa mtandao huo, na huduma zake nyingine.	this reputation may well give you a bigger name and provide it to many users of the internet and its other services.
<7>	Miaka mitano iliyopita, kampuni hiyo kwa kushirikiana na Kampuni ya Milvik Tanzania ilianzisha huduma ya bima ya afya inayoitwa BimaMkononi.	five years ago, the company, in partnership with the Milvik Tanzania company, started a life insurance company called BimaMkononi.
<8>	Haikuwa rahisi kwa Watanzania kujiunga na huduma hiyo, lakini kwa sasa kila mtumiaji wa Tigo anatamani kujiunga na huduma hiyo kutokana na uhalisia wake.	it was not easy for Tanzanians to join the service, but now every Tigo user likes to join that service as a result of its realism.
<9>	Hadi sasa wateja hai zaidi ya 200,000 wamejiunga na huduma hiyo, ambapo sharti kubwa la mteja ni kuwa mtumiaji wa huduma ya Tigopesa.	up to now, more that 200,000 living clients have joined the service where the biggest condition for the client is to be a user of Tigopesa services.
<10>	Haihitaji kuwa na kitambulisho zaidi ya namba ya simu ambayo ndiyo inayomtambulisha mteja pale anapojisajili.	he does not need to have identification beyond a phone number which identifies a customer when he registers.
<11>	Mteja wa huduma hii atalazimika kupiga namba maalumu pale anapotaka kudai fidia baada ya kuumwa au kupata ajali, ili Tigo iweze kulipa katika hospitali au kituo chochote cha afya pale muhusika alipohudumiwa.	a client of this service will be forced to call a special number when he wants to claim compensation after injury or an accident, so that Tigo can pay the hospital or any health center where the individual was served.
<12>	Mkuu wa Huduma za Kifedha kwa Simu za Mkononi wa Tigo, Ruan Swanapoel anasema BimaMkononi ni mfumo mpya wa bima unaowawezesha kuwakinga dhidi ya matukio yasiyotarajiwa, yanayoweza kuwa na athari kubwa kwa hali ya kifedha kama wasingekuwa wamejiunga na huduma au mpango huu wa bima.	the head of Tigo money services, Ruan Swanapoel, says BimaMkononi is a new system of insurance that enables individuals to insure themselves against unexpected risks which can have large financial effects if they haven't joined this insurance service or program.
<13>	“Wakati tunaazisha huduma hii tulilenga kuwapunguzia tabu wanayoipata Watanzania wa kawaida pindi wanapopata matatizo kama ajali na kuugua.	"when we started this service, we aimed to reduce the problems ordinary Tanzanians face when they get into problems such as accidents or sickness.
<14>	Kwa kiasi kikubwa tumefanikiwa,” anasema Swanapoel.	we have succeeded greatly," says Swanapoel.
<15>	Anafafanua kuwa ndani ya miaka mitano ya huduma hiyo kumekuwa na ufanisi mkubwa kutokana na jinsi ambavyo wateja wamekuwa wakilipwa fidia zao pale wanapopata matatizo.	he explains that in the five years of the service, there has been tremendous success in the way clients have been compensated when they had problems.
<16>	“Mambo tunayoyafanya na ambayo yanatuongezea sifa katika huduma hii ni pamoja na uwepesi wa kuwalipa fidia wateja wetu pale wanapokuwa wamepata matatizo.	"the things we do and the things that add quality in this service includes the ease of compensating our clients when they have had problems.
<17>	Hili ndilo linawavuta wengine kama ndugu na marafiki wa wale wahusika kujiunga na huduma hii,” anafafanua Swanapoel.	this is what attracts many people such as friends and family of those involved to join this service," explains Swanapoel.
<18>	Kwa mujibu wa meneja huyo, tayari BimaMkononi ishalipa fidia ya zaidi ya Sh milioni 27 katika kipindi cha miezi sita iliyopita.	according to the manager, BimaMkononi has already given compensations of more than 27 million shillings in the previous six months.
<19>	Saidi Kamote, mkazi wa Lindi anasema yeye binafsi aliamua kujiunga na huduma hiyo baada ya kushuhudia ndugu yake alikipiwa fidia kwa gharama alizozitumia baada ya kuumwa na kulazwa hospitali kwa muda wa siku tatu.	Saidi Kamote, a resident in Lindi, says he personally decided to join the service after witnessing his brother being compensated for the expenses he incurred after falling sick and being admitted for a period of three days.
<20>	Kamote anadai kuwa wakati ndugu yake anaugua familia yao ilikuwa katika wakati mgumu kifedha, lakini baadaye walirejeshewa fedha zao, baada ya kufuata taratibu zote za kudai fidia.	Kamote claims that when his brother was sick, his family was going through a hard time financially, but later they were refunded their money after following all the procedures of claiming compensation.
<21>	“Mwanzoni baada ya huyu ndugu yangu kutoka hospitalini, tulianza kushauriana jinsi ya kuanza upya tena kutafuta kipato, mimi ndio nilikuwa nae muda wote akiumwa, halafu ghafla akakumbuka hiyo BimaMkononi.	"initially after my brother left hospital, we started consulting each other on how to start looking for income anew, I was the one with him throughout his sickness and he suddenly remembered the BimaMkononi.
<22>	“Tuliwasiliana nao, wakatupatia maelekezo ya vithibitisho ambavyo tunatakiwa kupeleka, ikiwapo fomu maalumu za huko hospitali, baada ya hapo ilichukua kama siku tatu, akawa amefidiwa fedha tuliyotumia wakati anaumwa na maisha yakaendelea kama kawaida.	"we communicated with them, and they gave us instructions of proof we were supposed to present, including a special form from the hospital, after that it took like three days to be compensated the money we had spent when he was sick and life went on normally.
<23>	Binafsi sasa hivi nimeshajiunga na huduma hiyo,” anaeleza Kamote.	I personally have joined that service," explains Kamote.
<24>	Kwa upande wake Meneja wa Milvik Tanzania, Tom Chaplin anasema huduma ya BimaMkononi imetengenezwa makusudi kutoa bidhaa za bima kwa Watanzania wote ambao vinginevyo wasingeweza kumudu huduma hiyo katika hali ya kawaida, pale wanapopata matatizo, ajali au kuugua.	on his side, the manager of Milvik Tanzania, Tom Chaplin, says the BimaMkononi service has been made with the intention of providing insurance products to all Tanzanians who otherwise could not have afforded that service in normal circumstances when they have problems, an accident or get sick.
<25>	“Huduma hii inafikia wateja kupitia simu za mkononi kusaidia kufikiwa kwa urahisi kadri inavyowezekana kwa wakazi wa mjini na vijijini.	"this service reaches clients through cell phones to help ease of access as much as possible to urban and rural residents.
<26>	Bima Mkononi hadi sasa imekuwa na matokeo makubwa katika kuogeza kazi ya mzunguko wa fedha ndani ya sekta isiyo rasmi kwa kuwawezesha Watanzania kuzifikia huduma za bima wanazozimudu kutoka ndani ya simu zao.	up until now, BimaMkononi has had great results in the increase of cash circulation in the informal sector by enabling Tanzanians to access insurance services that they can manage from their phones.
<27>	“Lakini pia jambo jingine la fahari katika BimaMkononi, mteja hachaguliwi sehemu ya kupata huduma kwa maana ya hospitali.	"but also another thing to be proud of with BimaMkononi, a client is not restricted to a place to get service in terms of hospitals.
<28>	Kwa hili tumetoa uhuru kuwa kila mtu atibiwe anapotaka ila tupate taarifa kwa utaratibu tuliojiwekea ambapo kuna fomu maalumu zinatakiwa kujazwa baada ya mteja wetu kufidiwa au kulipiwa gharama alizotumia,” anasema Chaplin.	for this we have given everyone the freedom to be treated whenever they want, but we get information by the procedure we set when there is a special form that's supposed to be filled after our client is compensated or refunded the expenses he incurred," says Chaplin.
<29>	Tom Chaplain anaeleza kuwa huduma hiyo imetengenezwa mahsusi kwa kuwapatia watu wote bima za maisha, hospitali na huduma binafsi ya ajali ambazo zinaweza kuzisaidia familia zao kusimamia madhara ya kifedha ambayo yanaweza kusababishwa na matukio yasiyotarajiwa.	Tom Chaplin explains that the service is specifically designed to give everyone life insurance, health insurance and personal accident cover services that can help their families handle financial obligations that can arise from unforeseen occurrences.
