<1>	Yanga na Mchezaji Okwi Hapatoshi..	Yanga and their player Okwi are not enough.
<2>	Hivi Huyu Mchezaji ana Matatizo Gani ?	what problems does this player have?
<3>	Klabu ya Young Africans imemshitaki mchezaji Emmanuel Okwi kwa Shirikisho la Soka Tanzania (TFF) na kuwasilisha nakala kwa shirikisho la soka Barani Afrika (CAF) na shirikisho la soka duniani (FIFA) kwa kuingia mkataba na timu nyingine wakati akiwa bado ana mkataba wa miaka miwili.	the Young Africans Club has sued the player Emmanuel Okwi at the Tanzanian Football Federation (TFF) and submitted documents to the Continental Association of Football (CAF) and the Federation International of Football Association (FIFA) for entering an agreement with another team while he still has a two-year contract.
<4>	Akiongea na waandishi wa habari makao makuu ya klabu ya Yanga mitaa ya Twiga/Jangwani, mwenyekiti wa Yanga Bw Yusuf Manji amesema wameshangazwa na kitendo hicho kilichofanywa na viongozi wa Simba , wakala wake na mchezaji mwenyewe.	while speaking to the journalists at the headquarters of the Yanga Club in the neighborhoods of Twiga and Jangwani, the chairman of Yanga Yusuf Manji said they were surprised by that act conducted by Simba leaders, its agency and the player himself.
<5>	"Emmanuel Okwi awali tulishapeleka malalamiko TFF na kuwapa nakala CAF na FIFA juu ya kufanya mazungumzo na timu ya Wadi Degla FC ya nchini Misri na kufikia klabu hiyo kutuma ofa ya kutaka kumnunua bila kuwasiliana na uongozi wetu" alisema Yusuf.	"Emmanuel Okwi, earlier we submitted complaints to TFF and gave a copy to CAF and FIFA about conducting talks with the Wadi Degla FC team of Egypt and the club sending an offer to buy him without communicating with our leadership," said Yusuf.
<6>	Ikiwa hilo tunasubiria majibu kutoka TFF jana mchezaji huyo amesaini mkataba mwingine, hii inaonyesha ni jinsi gani mchezaji huyu kuna watu walikua wanamrubuni,kwa kusaini mkataba mwingine kitu ambacho amekiuka sheria za FIFA za usajili.	while awaiting feedback from TFF, the player yesterday signed another contract. this shows the manner in which people had been deceiving him by signing another contract, something that violates the FIFA signing procedures.
<7>	Baada ya kuona jana amesaini mkataba na Simba, Yanga tulichokifanya leo ni kuandika barua nyingine TFF juu ya suala hilo na kuomba kulipwa fidia ya US Dollar 500,000 (sawa na TZS 800,000,000/=) kutoka kwa klabu ya Simba, wakala wake na mchezaji mwenyewe aliongeza "Manji"	"after seeing yesterday that he signed a contract with Simba, what we have done today at Yanga is write another letter to TFF on that issue, requesting to be paid damages of USD 500,000 (equal to 800,000,000 Tanzanian shillings) by the Simba Club, its agency and the player himself," added Manji.
<8>	Aidha uongozi wa Yanga umeiomba TFF kuwa imelipatia ufumbuzi suala hilo ndani ya siku saba, na kama siku saba zikikpita basi uongozi wa Yanga utakwenda moja kwa moja FIFA na ikishindakana mahakama ya soka CAS.	furthermore, the leadership has requested that TFF find a solution to the matter within seven days, and if seven days go by, then the leadership of Yanga will go directly to FIFA, and if that fails, then to the soccer court of CAS.
<9>	Lengo sio kuikomoa timu ya Simba, bali tunachotaka ni sheria ifuatwe,	the aim is not to unbar the Simba team but what we want is for the law to be followed.
<10>	Okwi alikua ameitumikia klabu ya Ynaga kwa kipindi cha miezi sita tu, na kuwa amebakiza mkataba wa miaka miwili mpaka msimu mwishoni mwa msimu wa 2015/2016.	Okwi had worked for the Yanga Club for a period of just six months, and he has two years left until the end of the 2015/2016 season.
<11>	Mchezaji anayekutwa na kosa la kusaini sehem mbili adhabu yake ni kufungiwa kucheza soka kuanzia mwaka mmoja na kuendelea huku klabu husika ikifungiwa kusajili kuanzia miaka mwili na kuendela na kushushwa daraja au adhabu zote kwa pamoja.	a player who is found to have committed the offense of signing two contracts is liable to a punishment of being banned from playing soccer for one or more years, or the involved club could risk being barred from signing up for two or more years and being demoted from the level, or both punishments could be enforced at once.
