<4>	KAMPUNI ya MultiChoice-Tanzania au DSTV kama inavyojulikana sana, wiki iliyopita iliingia mkataba wa mwaka mmoja na mwanariadha Alphonce Simbu, ambao utamwezesha mwanariadha huyo kulipwa mshahara wa Sh milioni 1 kila mwezi.	the Multichoice Tanzania company or DSTV as it is famously known last week entered into a one-year agreement with athlete Alphonce Simbu, which will enable the athlete to be paid a salary of 1 million shillings each month.
<5>	Kampuni hiyo ilitangaza kutoa kiasi hicho cha fedha baada ya kufurahishwa na nafasi ya tano aliyoipata kijana huyo katika Michezo ya 31 ya Olimpiki iliyomalizika mwezi uliopita Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.	the company announced that they would give that amount of money after being impressed by the youth coming fifth place in the 31st Olympic Games that ended last month in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
<6>	Simbu alimaliza wa tano katika mchezo wa marathon, nafasi ambayo imemfanya kuvunja rekodi ya Juma Ikangaa ya kuwa Mtanzania wa kwanza kumaliza katika nafasi 10 baada ya kumaliza wa sita katika Olimpiki ya Los Angeles, Marekani 1984.	Simbu finished fifth in the marathon, a position that broke Juma Ikangaa's record of being the first Tanzanian to finish in the top 10 after finishing sixth in the Los Angeles Olympic Games in America in 1984.
<7>	Takribani ni miaka 32 sasa tangu Ikangaa alipoweka rekodi hiyo na hivyo ni jambo na kujivunia kwa Simbu kumaliza katika tano bora katika Michezo ya Olimpiki.	it has been approximately 32 years since Ikangaa set the record and so it is a thing of pride for Simbu to finish in fifth place in the Olympic Games.
<8>	Pamoja na kuwa Simbu hakupata medali, lakini ni jambo la kujivunia kwani kwa muda mrefu wanariadha wa Tanzania wamekuwa wakifanya vibaya sana katika mashindano mbalimbali ya hivi karibuni.	although Simbu did not win a medal, it is a thing to be proud of because for a long time, Tanzanian athletes have been performing very poorly in various competitions.
<9>	DSTV imeamua kumpatia Simbu Sh milioni 1 kila mwezi ili kumwezesha kuelekeza akili na nguvu zake zote katika mazoezi kitu ambacho kitamsaidia kujiandaa vizuri kwa mashindano mbalimbali yajayo.	DSTV has decided to give Simbu 1 million shillings every month to enable him to focus his mind and all his energy on training, something that will help him prepare well in various future competitions.
<10>	Mwakani kuna mashindano ya dunia ya riadha yatakayofanyika London kuanzia Agosti 5-13 na Simbu amepania kufanya vizuri katika mashindano hayo.	next year there are world athletics competitions that will take place in London from August 5-13 and Simbu is anticipated to do well in the competition.
<11>	Hadi sasa ni mwanariadha mmoja tu wa Tanzania, Christopher Isegwe ndiye aliyewahi kutwaa medali baada ya kumaliza wa pili katika mbio za marathon mashindano yalipofanyikia Helisink, Finland mwaka 2005.	until now, there is only one Tanzanian athlete, Christopher Isegwe, who has ever clinched a medal after he finished second in the marathon in Helsinki, Finland in 2005.
<12>	Baada ya DSTV kuonesha njia kwa kumpatia mshahara Simbu, kampuni nyingine nazo zijitokeze kuwasaidia pia wachezaji wengine ili Tanzania ingâ€™are kimataifa kama ilivyokuwa zamani.	after DSTV showed the way by giving Simbu a salary, other companies should also come out to help other players so that Tanzania will shine internationally as it did back in the old days.
<13>	Simbu anatakiwa kuwa na wenzake wakati wa mazoezi, hivyo ni muhimu kampuni nyingine zikafuata mfano wa DSTV kwa kuwadhamini wachezaji wengine watakaofanya mazoezi pamoja na mkali huyo wa Tanzania.	Simbu is supposed to be with his colleagues during practice, and so it is important that other companies follow DSTV's example by sponsoring other players who will practice with the Tanzanian hotshot.
<14>	Hakuna miujiza ila siri ya kufanya vizuri katika mashindano mbalimbali ni mazoezi ya uhakika na ya muda mrefu, ambayo humwezesha mchezaji kuwa fiti kushindana na wengine mashindanoni.	there is no miracle but the secret of doing well in various competitions is consistent and lengthy practice, which enables a player to be fit to compete with others in competitions.
<15>	Tayari Kampuni ya Mawasiliano Tanzania ya TTCL hivi karibuni ilitangaza mpango wa kukutana na viongozi wa riadha ili kuona nini kinafanyika kuhakikisha wanawasaidia wanariadha wa Tanzania kufanya vizuri.	already, Tanzania Telecommunications Company (TTCL) recently announced a plan to meet with athletics officials to see what can be done to ensure that they help Tanzanian athletes to do well.
<16>	Si mbaya TTCL kama nao wakafuata utaratibu wa DSTV wa kumdhamini Simbu na wao wakawachukua baadhi ya wanariadha na kuingia nao mikataba kwa ajili ya kuwasaidia ili wafanye vizuri.	it is not bad if TTCL will also follow DSTV's example of sponsoring Simbu and they also take up some of the athletes and enter into agreements with them for the purposes of helping them so that they can do well.
<17>	Siku zote juhudi ni shina la maendeleo, hivyo kampuni zijitokeze kuwasaidia wanariadha pamoja na wachezaji wengine ili waweze kufanya vizuri wanaposhiriki mashindano ya kimataifa.	effort is always the root of development, so companies should come out to help athletes as well as other sportsmen so that they can do well when they take part in international competitions.
