<1>	(0.000-17.930)	hapa studio <breath> eh kabla ya -- ya kuzungumza na Maremi kuna hili tatizo la mitandao kama unavyozungumzia mitandao ya kijamii ambako hakuna ethic kuna matusi hasa ukichukulia mfano <breath> hii jamii forum kuna matusi hata Rais mle anatukanwa sana -- sana -- sana .	here in the studio yes before of -- of talking to Maremi there is this internet problem like you're talking about social media where there are no ethics there are insults take for example this Jamii forum there are insults even the president is being insulted there very much -- very much -- very much .
<2>	(17.930-20.332)	labda ya kama nyinyi mnachukua hatua gani ?	maybe of like you what steps are you taking ?
<3>	(20.332-22.220)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<4>	(22.220-43.887)	<sta> kwa- -- kwa- -- kwa- -- kwa- -- kwa ma- -- kwa jambo lolote lile ambalo ni kosa la jinai na lina tendeka kwenye mtandao <sta> eh wenzetu wa polisi hususa ni kitengo cha <sta> eh cyber crime eh wanaweza kabisa kuwa- -- kuwa- -- kuwa- -- kuwa kamata hawa watu nakufanya vile ambavyo <sta> inapaswa kwa mujibu wa sheria .	for any such issue that is a criminal offense and it is being done on the internet yes our colleagues from the police especially the cyber crime department yes they are totally able to arrest these people and to do what is required according to the law .
<5>	(43.887-52.470)	lakini eh tatizo linalo jitokeza ni kwamba <sta> watu hawana elimu kwamba wanavyofanya vile wanavunja sheria .	but yes the problem that seems to be people lack knowledge that they are breaking the law when they do .
<6>	(52.470-61.060)	<sta> na ndiyo maana ukisema leo hii kwa mfano wewe nenda sasa hivi ukitoka kwenye meza hii kaangalie kwenye Facebook <breath> jaribu kuangalia watu wangapi leo ingepaswa wafikishwe mahakamani .	and that's why if you say today this for example you go right now after you leave this table look at Facebook try to look how many people today should be taken to court .
<7>	(61.060-64.300)	<sta> unaweza usifanye kazi ingine yeyote ikawa ndiyo kazi hiyo hiyo .	you can stop doing any other work so that's the work that that .
<8>	(64.300-73.830)	<sta> Port wa mzima <breath> na kwa mwaka mzima hukukamata hawa watu sasa <breath> <sta> kwa vile bado sio wengi tunafikiri bado kuna fursa ya kuendelea kutoa elimu .	a whole port and for a whole year you didn't arrest these people now because they aren't many we think there is still a chance to continue giving information .
<9>	(73.830-86.710)	<sta> waweze kuelimishwa kama wasifanye hivyo na <hes> sasa hivi kwa mfano mtandao huo wa jamii forum <sta> mimi mwenyewe ni mwanachama mle kwa maana ya kwamba ni sehemu moja ambayo pia nami mi napata habari zangu <breath> lakini hata mimi na weka habari zangu .	they should be informed so that they don't do that right now for example this Jamii forum media I myself I am a member there because it's one area that I also get news and I also post my news .
<10>	(86.710-112.580)	<sta> na katika mkutano ambao tulifanya mwaka jana hawa ni watu ambao <breath> hawakukuwa hivi kama walivyo sasa hivi -- sasa hivi kuna mabadiliko makubwa ina wezekana <sta> kuna baadhi bado wanafanya kama hiyo wana tukana wanafanya nini <breath> lakini wale wenye mtandao kwa maana hawa miliki na wale waendesha mijadala <sta> wana wajibika kuhakikisha inapotokea jambo kama hilo <sta> wana -litoa unless kweli huyo mtu anayetoa hayo malalamiko yake <breath> awe ana ushahidi anachofanya .	and in the meeting that we did last year these are people who were not like they were now -- right now there are major changes it's possible there are some who still do that they insult and what have you but those with networks they don't own them and those who moderate debates are responsible in ensuring when something like that happens they remove it unless the person making the complaints really has evidence of what he is doing .
<11>	(112.580-113.838)	<sta> na tumeona imebadilika .	and we have seen it has changed .
<12>	(113.838-121.760)	<breath> kama kuna matatizo kama yatakuwa bado madogo lakini- <sta> nil sema kuna vitu vina zungumziwa kule ni sensitive watu hawaja zoea <breath> mijadala kama ile .	if there are problems if they will still be small but -- I said there are things we talk about there they are sensitive people haven't been used to discussions like those .
<13>	(121.760-129.348)	<sta> lakini ninafikiri imebadilika kwa kiasi fulani na tunavyo endelea <lipsmack> unajua hapa <sta> tunadeal na tabia za watu .	but I think it has changed by a certain level and the way we're continuing you know here we're dealing with people's behavior .
<14>	(129.348-135.220)	mtandao ule sio mbaya kabisa kwa sababu asilimia kubwa kule kuna watu wanajifunza na wanaongea vitu via maana sana .	that media isn't very bad because a large percentage of people there who are learning and talking about very meaningful things .
<15>	(135.220-143.422)	nafikiri umeona kuna majukuwa ya siasa -- majukuwa ya nini <breath> lakini wako wachache ambao kwa tabia zao na hulka zao ndiyo matatizo .	I think you've seen there are political platforms -- platforms of what but there are a few who by their behavior and condition are the problem .
<16>	(143.422-149.902)	na sisi kama mamlaka huwa tunasema mitandao ya kijamii sio mibaya isipokuwa watumiaji wake .	and we like an authority usually say social media isn't bad except its users .
<17>	(149.902-151.719)	baadhi ndiyo wabaya .	only a section are bad .
<18>	(151.719-157.870)	<breath> kwa hivyo nafikiri ni swala la tabia <breath> na tabia kwa bahati mbaya C_C_R_I haiwezi kusimamia tabia za watu .	therefore I think it's a behavioral issue and behavior by bad luck C_C_R_I can't manage people's behavior .
<19>	(157.870-162.485)	<sta> hakuna malalamiko wengi wacha hao wanaotukana kuna wengine wanajiuza kwenye mitandao ya kijamii .	there are no complaints leave those who insult there are others who sell themselves on social media .
<20>	(162.485-164.180)	sasa- -- kujiuza vipi yaani ?	now -- to sell one's self how meaning ?
<21>	(164.180-172.270)	<sta> wanatumia fu- -- mawasiliano kujiuza kwa maana ku- -- fursa kwamba niko hapa na picha anaweka jamani habari ndiyo hiyo .	they use -- communication to sell themselves because -- the chance that I am here with a picture he posts it comrade that's the news .
<22>	(172.270-182.893)	<sta> sasa -- hii pia ni- -- eh Marini unanielewa <laugh> na haya maswala hatuwezi kuyazungumza hadharani hapa lakini sasa issue pale <sta> sio mtandao umesababisha .	now this also is yes Marini you understand me and we can't talk about these issues publicly here but now the issue there isn't caused by the media .
<23>	(182.893-213.540)	ni tabia ya yule mtu- -- hivi hebu nikuulize nani <no-speech> <hes> Innocent <sta> hapa Tanzania umewahi kukutana na mitandao ambayo ina- -- ina- -- <no-speech> <sta> inauza <hes> nafaka ya Tanzania inauza <hes> <sta> product ya Kitanzania cha kiwango kikubwa sana -- <hes> <sta> sio kwa kiwango kikubwa lakini naweza nikasema kwa mfano nawafahamu kwa mfano kuna block moja- -- at least wanafika ishirini ?	it's that person's behavior -- like this let me ask you who Innocent here in Tanzania have you ever come across media that -- it sells Tanzanian grain it sells Tanzanian products of a very big level -- not on a big level but I can say for example I know for example there is one block -- at least they reach twenty ?
<24>	(213.540-214.726)	<hes> zaidi -- zaidi .	more more .
<25>	(214.726-218.028)	wapo -- wapo Marini wapo wengine wanatumia tu Facebook page .	they are there -- they are there Marini there are some who use just a Facebook page .
<26>	(218.028-218.738)	wapo .	they are there .
<27>	(218.738-228.013)	kina <hes> zuri fashion <sta> eh wanauza vitu wanavyovitengeneza wao wenyewe <sta> wapo watu wengi wanafanya vitu vingi tu vya Kitanzania .	the likes of Zuri fashion they sell things that they make themselves there are many people who do just many Tanzanian things .
<28>	(228.013-239.344)	<breath> wanauza mazao mazao yao mtu anaonyesha tangu analima <sta> watu wanauza kuku wana fuga wanaonyesha kabisa kuku yuko tayari mtu anayetaka kuku kuna watu wanafanya biashara mfano wana leta kuku .	they sell produce their produce someone shows since he's farming they sell chicken they keep they show the chicken is ready someone who wants chicken there are people who do business an example they bring chicken .
<29>	(239.344-244.620)	mimi mwenyewe huwa ni mmoja wa watu ambao <breath> nanunua kuku kwenye mtandao wa kijana mmoja yuko (()) hapo sokoni .	I'm personally one of those people who buy chicken on the internet from one of the youth at (()) in the market .
<30>	(244.620-249.029)	<sta> analeta kuku anakwambia kuna kukuwa Tanga nawa Singida <breath> ladha zao <int> tofauti .	he brings chicken and tells you that the chicken from Tanga and Singida taste differently .
<31>	(249.029-254.793)	ukitaka wa Tanga wa- <sta> -- ukitaka jogoo la kuchi kubwa <breath> na anaweka picha mle .	if you want of Tanga of -- if you want a big red rooster and he puts a picture in there .
<32>	(254.793-255.859)	kwa hivyo wapo .	therefore they are there .
<33>	(255.859-264.070)	isipokuwa sasa <no-speech> <sta> baadhi yetu watumiaji mtu anaweka jogoo pale jamani jogoo kisha mtu analilinganisha yule jogoo na kitu fulani .	except now a section of us users will find someone posting a cock there and then someone's compares to a certain thing .
<34>	(264.070-265.740)	hiyo ndiyo tatizo ambalo lipo sasa .	that's the problem that is there now .
<35>	(265.740-268.400)	<int> wanajitahidi na wengine hata wanaogopa .	they are trying and others are even afraid .
<36>	(268.400-278.689)	<sta> kuna shule nyingi tu zina mitandao kwamba shule yangu hii inafanya hiki na hiki -- na hiki <breath> kilimo kwa mfano wa umwagiliaji iko page moja inashughulikia na hilo <sta> kwa hiyo <lipsmack> ipo ma- -- nafikiri .	there are just many schools that have internet that my school this is doing this and that -- and the irrigation farming for example has a page dealing with that I therefore think it's there .
<37>	(278.689-290.435)	moja katika athari ya kimataifa kabisa ni hiyo uliyo itaja ya <hes> <sta> ya kuendesha bi- -- biashara ya kuuza miili kupitia hii <int> mambo ya (()) .	one of the major international effects is the one you mentioned of running the business of prostitution through this issue of (()) .
<38>	(290.435-295.720)	sasa <hes> <sta> nyinyi kama mamlaka <hes> m- -- m- -- mnafunguliwa vipi macho hii ?	now you like an authority how are you able to deal with this ?
<39>	(295.720-305.129)	<sta> <hes> sasa ndiyo nilicho sema Marini mamlaka ya mawasiliano sio mamlaka ya kudhibiti tabia za watu <sta> sisi tunasimamia na kudhibiti huduma za mawasiliano .	now that's what I said Marini the communication authority isn't an authority that controls people's behavior we manage and control communication services .
<40>	(305.129-310.323)	<breath> sasa mawasiliano yanapotumika kufanya uhalifu kama huu <sta> iko sheria .	now when communication is used to commit a crime like this is there a law .
<41>	(310.323-311.601)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<42>	(311.601-313.510)	hiyo ni kosa la jinai .	that is a criminal offense .
<43>	(313.510-319.269)	ambao sasa hapo ni tabia <sta> unajua hebu tuchukulie kwa mfano <lipsmack> -- hebu %incomplete	which now is a behavior you know please let's take for example -- please %incomplete
<44>	(319.269-323.049)	kabla hukumaliza <int> <no-speech> hamwezi kuifungia ?	before you finish can't you close it ?
<45>	(323.049-324.920)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<46>	(324.920-326.070)	<sta> hamna mamlaka .	there is no authority .
<47>	(326.070-328.040)	<overlap> mbele ya tabia ya mtu .	before a person's behavior .
<48>	(328.040-328.500)	ndiyo .	yes .
<49>	(328.500-331.920)	lakini <no-speech> hata kufungia basi ?	but even closing then ?
<50>	(331.920-336.609)	<sta> bwana Marini kwa vile mabasi yana pata ajali kwa hivyo tu ondoa huduma ya mabasi barabarani ?	mister Marini because buses get accidents therefore we should remove bus services on the road ?
<51>	(336.609-337.550)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<52>	(337.550-350.457)	<sta> sisemi <overlap> mwondoe huduma hizi za Citizen (()) <int> lakini ile particular <int> ile ambayo inajihusisha <sta> ni shughuli fulani ya kinyume na maadili ya Mtanzania <sta> kinyume na maadili ya Mwafrika .	I am not saying that you should remove Citizen services (()) but that one particular that one which involves with certain activities contrary to the ethics of a Tanzanian and the ethics of an African .
<53>	(350.457-352.336)	hizo nyingi mbona tunazifungia Marini ?	those many why are we closing them Marini ?
<54>	(352.336-359.394)	kwa mfano zile za kitapeli watu wanatapeli <sta> unajua pia kuna sheria zinazosimamia hiyo mitandao ya kijamii .	for example the fraudulent ones where people are fraudulent there are laws that oversee the social media .
<55>	(359.394-366.692)	<breath> sisi tume rithia watu <breath> wawe Uhuru katika kujieleza <sta> tume rithia ile ya Umoja wa mataifa ya kuruhusu watu kujieleza <breath> .	we approve people to be free in expressing themselves we agree with the United Nations in allowing people to express themselves .
<56>	(366.692-374.464)	sasa mtandao kama Facebook kwa mfano <sta> unaeleza mtu anapofanya jambo ambalo nyinyi linawakera kama Watanzania <breath> toa taarifa .	now networks like Facebook for example you explain that when someone does something that anger you like Tanzanians to give information .
<57>	(374.464-388.127)	na tunatoanga taarifa na wanawafungia baadhi ya watu <sta> lakini kuna mengine wanakwambia hii bwana huyu mtu kasema jambo hili <breath> <sta> nyinyi kama mna thibitisha ni uongo basi mwambieni aseme- -- <breath> -- nyie semeni ukweli <sta> na mmkatalie huyo lakini sio kumfungia <breath> .	and we give information and they close some of the people but there are others they tell you this mister this person say this you if you prove that it's a lie then tell him to say -- you say the truth and refuse that one not to shut him down .
<58>	(388.127-397.249)	wao ndiyo wenye mamlaka ya kufunga kwa sababu ule mtandao kama Facebook haupo hapa Tanzania <sta> huko Marekani na unaendeshwa kwa mujibu na kanuni <breath> <sta> za Kimarekani .	they are the ones with the authority to close because that Facebook network isn't here in Tanzania it's there in America and it's run according to the American laws and regulations .
<59>	(397.249-412.884)	<breath> na kule wenzetu unajua ndiyo wanaua Uhuru wa kujieleza hata Obama wanamtukana kama wanavyo taka <sta> ingawa sio jambo la kistarabu -- lakini Uhuru bila mipaka sio Uhuru -- sasa ndiyo maana <overlap> wana mipaka na ulivyoona si umesikia <sta> juzi -- juzi hapa kulikuwa matatizo kuwa serikali inaingilia mawasiliano .	and our colleagues there you know are the ones killing the freedom of self-expression and even abusing Obama the way they want although it's not a civilized thing -- but freedom without boundaries isn't freedom -- now that's why they have boundaries and like you saw and heard the day before yesterday -- the day before yesterday here there were problems that the government is interfering with communication .
<60>	(412.884-424.844)	<breath> na bwana Obama nilimsikia akizungumza bila kumumunya maneno mnavyosema <sta> kwamba hakuna Uhuru kamili wa kujieleza lakini wakati huo -- huo utegemee asilimia mia moja wa usalama wako .	and I heard mister Obama speaking without mincing words when you say there is no complete freedom of speech but at that time that depends on one hundred percent of your safety .
<61>	(424.844-426.110)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<62>	(426.110-426.685)	kwa maana kwa- %incomplete	because for -- %incomplete
