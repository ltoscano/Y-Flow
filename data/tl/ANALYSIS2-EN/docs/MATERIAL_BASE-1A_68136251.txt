<1>	(0.000-1.020)	kufanya uchaguzi .	conducting elections .
<2>	(1.020-7.070)	lakini mpaka sasa ni miezi saba imepita hakuna hata moja lililofanyiwa marekebisho katika kilabu hiyo .	but up until now seven months have gone by and there is none that has been rectified in that club .
<3>	(7.070-11.015)	kitu ambacho huenda kikaathiri uchaguzi mkuu uliopangwa kufanyika mwezi Juni .	something that might affect the general elections planned to be held in June .
<4>	(11.015-15.700)	ili ufanye uchaguzi kwanza pia unahitaji siku sitini kutangaza uchaguzi huo .	so as to conduct elections you need sixty days to announce that election .
<5>	(15.700-18.867)	na muda tulio nao ni mdogo .	and the time we have is little .
<6>	(18.867-24.640)	ingekuwa wakati huu tayari katiba tumesharekebisha tunasema kwamba June tunaweza .	by now we ought to have rectified the constitution already and saying that we could make it in June .
<7>	(24.640-39.310)	lakini kwa hali ilivyo <no-speech> <hes> kusema ukweli haitawezekana kwa sababu ni lazima tuitishe <hes> mkutano wa wanachama wapitishe katiba halafu baadaye ndiyo tuweze kuitisha <hes> mkutano -- uchaguzi .	but in that state to be honest it won't be possible because we must call for a members' meeting to pass the constitution and then later one call for a meeting on elections .
<8>	(39.310-46.250)	<breath> ndiko nilikotaka kujua sababu zina sababisha kilabu hiyo kushindwa <breath> kutekeleza maagizo kutoka T_F_F .	it's the reason I wanted to know the reasons making the club fail to execute the instructions from T_F_F .
<9>	(46.250-48.602)	ni kweli uongozi hauko kitu kimoja .	it's true the leadership is not united .
<10>	(48.602-55.105)	na wala sasa hivi mimi niko ni mwenyekiti kweli .	and yet at the moment I am a chairperson indeed .
<11>	(55.105-62.810)	lakini wenyekiti wangu bado haujakuwa na nguvu kutokana na kwamba una- -- utekelezaji kutoka T_F_F haujafanyika .	but my chairing has not been powerful yet because the execution from T_F_F has not been done .
<12>	(62.810-66.677)	pia Mguto amesema hatima yake ya kugombea au kutogombea iko kwa wanachama .	Mguto has also said that his fate for vying or not vying is with the members .
<13>	(66.677-69.840)	endapo watamhitaji ataingia tena katika kinyang'anyiro .	should they need him he will get into the contest again .
<14>	(69.840-73.970)	lakini wasipomhitaji atawapisha watu wengine waendeleze kilabu hiyo .	but should they not need him he will give way to other people to develop the club .
<15>	(73.970-81.710)	<breath> T_F_F ilitoa agizo kwa kilabu zote <breath> kuwa hazitaruhusiwa kufanya uchaguzi <breath> endapo zitashindwa kurekebisha katiba za kilabu zao .	T_F_F gave an order to all clubs that they will not be allowed to conduct elections should they fail to review their clubs' constitutions .
<16>	(81.710-87.980)	ili kuendana na katiba ya shirikisho hilo inayolingana na ile ya shirikisho la soka la dunia FIFA .	to go in line with the federation's constitution which is similar to the federation of the world's soccer FIFA .
<17>	(87.980-94.469)	<breath> kwa mujibu wa katiba ya T_F_F <breath> uchaguzi wa vilabu unatakiwa kutangazwa ndani ya siku sitini <breath> kabla ya kufanyika .	according to the T_F_F's constitution the clubs' elections are required to be announced inside sixty days before taking place .
<18>	(94.469-103.370)	lakini mpaka sasa Coastal haijafanya hivyo ikiwa imebaki miezi mitatu ambayo ni siku tisini kabla ya kufanyika uchaguzi wake .	but until now Coastal has not done so with only three months left which is ninety days before conducting its elections .
<19>	(103.370-107.243)	Joyce Nsima Star T_V Dar es Salaam .	Joyce Nsima Star T_V Dar es Salaam .
<20>	(107.243-108.260)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<21>	(108.260-109.251)	asante sana .	thank you very much .
