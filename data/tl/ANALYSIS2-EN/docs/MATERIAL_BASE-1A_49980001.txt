<1>	Huu ni mwaka wa Yanga lakiniâ€¦	this is Yanga's year but...
<2>	Mar 01, 2013	March 01, 2013
<3>	WANAOFUATILIA Ligi Kuu ya Vodacom Tanzania Bara hawatopishana na kauli hii kuwa huu ni mwaka wa timu ya Yanga ya Dar es Salaam.	those following the Vodacom Tanzania Mainland Premier League will not argue with this point that this is the year for Dar es Salaam's Yanga team.
<4>	Baada ya kutoka katika kambi yao nchini Uturuki katika mji wa Antalya, timu hiyo imejijengea historia ya kutopoteza mchezo hata mmoja kuanzia mechi za kirafiki mpaka za ligi kuu.	after coming from their camp in Antalya, the team has built itself a history of not losing even a single match starting from friendly matches to the premier league.
<5>	Hilo limeleta furaha kubwa katika kona za mitaa ya Twiga na Jangwani na kuanza kujitangazia ubingwa.	this has brought so much joy in the corners of Twiga and Jangwani streets where announcing themselves as champions has started.
<6>	Sitaki kutofautiana na mawazo ya ubingwa kwa wapenzi wa Yanga, ila nataka kuwapa hadhari kuwa ligi mzunguko wa pili bado ni changa.	I don't want to go against the championship mindset for Yanga lovers, but I want to give them a warning that the return leg of the league is still young.
<7>	Timu zinatakiwa kucheza mechi 13, mpaka sasa Yanga wamecheza mechi nne tu katika hizo.	teams are supposed to play 13 matches and until now, Yanga has only played four matches out of those.
<8>	Si vyema kujitangazia ubingwa baada ya kucheza na Azam, sikuwepo uwanjani kushuhudia mpambano huo wa Azam na Yanga uliovunja rekodi ya mapato msimu huu kwa kuingiza Sh mil 240/= ambapo mashabiki 39,315 waliingia, lakini naamini Azam hawakucheza chini ya kiwango bali ni matokeo tu ya soka kuwa lazima mshindi apatikane ama suluhu.	it is not right to announce your championship after playing with Azam. I was not in the stadium to witness the battle between Azam and Yanga that broke the income record this year by bringing 240 million shillings where 39,315 fans entered, but I believe Azam did not play below average instead it is just that soccer means that a winner must be found as a solution.
<9>	Vijiwe vingi vya soka kwa sasa vinazungumza kuwa mechi ngumu ya Yanga ni moja tu katika tisa zilizobaki, ni ya watani wao wa jadi Simba; lakini wakumbuke msimu huu kuna timu zina uchu wa kumaliza nafasi za juu kama wababe wa Simba Mtibwa Sugar, Kagera Sugar, Coastal Union na Ruvu Shooting.	many football tablets currently say that Yanga only has one difficult match in the remaining nine, their great rivals Simba, but they should remember that this season there are teams longing to finish at the top such as Mtibwa Sugar, Kagera Sugar, Coastal Union and Ruvu Shooting.
<10>	Aidha, wakumbuke kuwa vibonde wao wa siku zote wanaowatumia kama ngazi Toto African ya Mwanza, mwaka huu wapo katika hatihati ya kushuka daraja hivyo wasitarajie pointi kutoka kwao.	moreover, they should remember that their all time rivals whom they use as their ladder, Toto Africa, are at risk of being relegated, so they should not expect a point from them.
<11>	Badala ya kuanza kushangilia ubingwa huku wakiwa mbele kwa pointi tatu tu juu ya Azam na pointi nane dhidi ya Simba, wafikirie kujipanga kuongeza mbio ili wawe mbali zaidi kwani Azam nao wanataka kuweka historia ya kuwa timu pekee changa kuchukua ubingwa tangu kuanzishwa kwake mwaka 2007.	instead of starting to celebrate the victory when they are only leading by three points against Azam and eight points against Simba, they should think of speeding up so that they get as far as Azam, and they also want to set a record of being the only young team to be champions since its launch in 2007.
<12>	Kosa hili halifanywi na klabu ya Yanga tu hata Simba nao hurudia makosa hayahaya kwa kuamini ukiwa unakuwa bingwa ukishacheza na Simba au Yanga, halafu ukicheza na timu zinazoshika nafasi ya pili ama ya tatu, bila kuzingatia kuwa hata timu nyingine zina uwezo wa kuwafunga ama kutoa suluhu.	this mistake is not only made by Yanga, Simba also repeats this same mistake of believing that when you become a champion if you play with Simba or Yanga then you play with the teams in the second or third place, regardless of whether the other teams have the ability to score against you or even draw.
<13>	Na hili ndilo linalorudisha nyuma soka la Tanzania, mpira wa miguu upo kiushabiki zaidi kuliko kiushindani.	and that is what draws back Tanzanian football, football is too fanatic instead of competitive.
<14>	Tukumbuke kuna michuano ya klabu bingwa Afrika, kombe la shirikisho na michuano ya CAF.	we should remember that there is the African club championship tournament, the CAF federation cup tournament.
<15>	Hizi timu tatu za juu tunazozitarajia zikatuwakilishe zikianza kuwa na mawazo ya kizembe namna hii tusitegemee kufika popote.	these three top teams we expect to represent us, if they start having this kind of lazy minds we should not expect to get anywhere.
<16>	Yanga wanashangilia ubingwa wakati imebakisha mechi dhidi ya Kagera Sugar yenye uchu wa kubaki juu, Toto African wanaotishiwa na balaa la kushuka daraja, Ruvu Shooting inayokuja kwa kasi, JKT Oljoro, Mgambo JKT yenye sifa ya kuvimbia timu kubwa.	Yanga is celebrating its victory while it still has a match against Kagera Sugar, which has enough passion to remain on top, Toto Africa threatens to be relegated, Ruvu Shooting are coming up at a very fast pace, JKT Oljoro, Mgambo JKT are famous for obstructing big teams.
<17>	Coastal Union iliyorudi ligi kuu kwa kasi, Polisi Morogoro iliyokalia kuti kavu, JKT Ruvu na mahasimu wao Wekundu wa Msimbazi Simba.	Coastal Union which came back to the league so fast, Police Morogoro that sits on a dry palm leaf, JKT Ruvu and their great Msimbazi rivals Simba.
<18>	Na katika mechi tisa ilizobakisha mechi sita watacheza nyumbani na tatu watakuwa ugenini.	and in the nine matches left, it will play six home matches and three away matches.
