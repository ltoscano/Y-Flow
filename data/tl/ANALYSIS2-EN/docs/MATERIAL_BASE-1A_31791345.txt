<4>	MKUU wa Wilaya ya Shinyanga, Josephine Matiro amewataka waendesha pikipiki wanaobeba abiria ambao hawajapata mafunzo ya udereva waende wakasome Chuo cha Elimu na Mafunzo ya Ufundi (VETA), wazijue sheria na taratibu za usalama barabarani kuepusha ajali zinazosababishwa na madereva kwa kutojua sheria.	Shinyanga District Commissioner, Josephine Matiro, has asked passenger-carrying motorcycle riders who have not received driving lessons to go to the polytechnic (VETA) to learn road safety laws and regulations to avoid the accidents that are caused by drivers because they don't know the law.
<5>	Agizo hilo alilitoa jana wakati akizindua mpango wa ukopeshaji wa pikipiki za bodaboda kutoka Benki ya CRDB Tawi la Shinyanga uliofanyika mjini hapo, ambako aliwataka waendesha bodaboda wote wanaotaka kukopeshwa pikipiki waende kusoma Veta ili wazijue sheria za barabarani.	she gave this instruction yesterday while launching the Bodaboda motorbike-loaning program from the CRDB Bank, Shinyanga branch, which took place in town, and she wanted all the motorbike riders who want motorbike loans to go for training at VETA to learn road rules.
<6>	Matiro alisema utaratibu wa kukopeshwa waendesha bodaboda ni mzuri kwani ni kujikwamua kiuchumi, lakini wanatakiwa kutimiza vigezo vinavyotakiwa ikiwemo sifa ya kusoma na kuzijua sheria za usalama barabarani hivyo wanatakiwa kuwa na vyeti vya Veta.	Matiro said that the procedure of loaning motorbikes is good because it is saving themselves economically, but they are supposed to complete the required stages including the qualification to read and know the road safety rules, and thus are required to have Veta certificates.
<7>	“Agizo hili liwe kigezo kabla hawajapewa pikipiki wawe na vigezo wasome Veta ili wawe na sifa za sheria za barabarani na wanapotimiza vigezo hivyo inatakiwa wavae kofia zinazotakiwa kuvaliwa wakati wanapobeba abiria kwani hizo zinasaidia hata pale anapopata ajali hapati madhara makubwa,” alisema Matiro.	"this directive should be a milestone. they receive motorbikes, so they should have stages - they should study at Veta so that they have qualifications on road rules, and when they complete the stages, they should put on helmets because they protect them from great injuries in case of accidents," said Matiro.
<8>	Meneja wa Benki ya CRDB Tawi la Shinyanga, Said Pamui alisema awamu ya kwanza wametoa pikipiki nne aina za SANLG zenye thamani ya Sh milioni tisa ambazo kila moja ina thamani ya Sh milioni 2.1	the CRDB Bank Shinyinga branch manager, Said Pamui, said that in the first session they released four SANLG motorbikes worth nine million shillings, each for 2.1 million shillings.

<10>	Alisema pikipiki hizo wamezikabidhi kwa wahusika ambao wametimiza vigezo ambapo walipewa uhuru wa kurejesha kwa mwezi au kwa wiki na wao kuchagua watarejesha kwa mwezi Sh 70,000, ambapo mkopo huo wa miezi 12 utakuwa na riba ya asilimia 18 badala ya 20.	he said that they have handed over these motorcycles to the relevant people who have actualized the signs, and they were given freedom to return them in a month or in a week, and they chose to chose to return 70,000 shillings in a month. the 12-month loan will have an interest of 18 percent instead of 20.
<11>	“Tumeona tuwaunganishe kwenye bima ya maisha ili kama mtu anaweza kupata ajali akaumia akashindwa kuendesha asidaiwe hata kama amefariki familia yake isisumbuliwe kwa kudaiwa italipwa na bima hiyo,” alisema Pamui.	"we have decided to connect them to life insurance so that if someone gets in an accident and gets injured and cannot ride, they can get help, and even if they lose their life, their family would not be troubled to pay, since it will be paid by the insurance," said Pamui.
<12>	Mwenyekiti wa Chama cha Waendesha Bodaboda (Shimodu), Mwita Mniko aliishukuru CRDB kwa kuwakubalia ombi lao na kuanza kuwakopesha mkopo wa bei nafuu hivyo aliomba iendelee kuwakopesha na wengine, kwani waombaji walikuwa 30, lakini wameonekana hawana vigezo, lakini wakisaidiwa nao wataweza kujikwamua kimaisha.	Bodaboda rider's association (Shimodu) chairman, Mwita Mniko, thanked CRDB for accepting their request to start giving them affordable loans and asked them to continue giving loans to others, since there are 30 applicants who did not have insurance, but if loaned, they will also be able to take off in life.
