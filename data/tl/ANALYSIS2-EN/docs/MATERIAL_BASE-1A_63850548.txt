<1>	(0.000-1.852)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<2>	(1.852-9.661)	Watanzania wengi tunapenda kushabikia timu za ulaya na maoni mengi yametolewa kwamba ni vitu gani ambavyo vinatufanya tushabikie hivyo .	most of us Tanzanians like supporting European teams and many opinions have been made on the things that make us give that support .
<3>	(9.661-12.740)	sasa <breath> nini kafanyika kwa sababu ya hii hali tunayo ?	so what happened due to the situation we have ?
<4>	(12.740-22.452)	<hes> kwa maoni yangu niliyo nayo ni kwamba <breath> zaidi wachezaji wa timu zetu za Tanzania wanatakiwa sasa kuonyesha ufundi zaidi katika michezo .	in my opinion the players of our Tanzanian teams are now supposed to show more creativity in the game .
<5>	(22.452-32.577)	<breath> maana nao ufundi umekuwa ukiwafanya kwamba <breath> watu Watanzania ama mashabiki <breath> washindwe kushabikia ile michezo <breath> kutokana na ufundi wanao huonyesha .	because creativity has been making Tanzanians or the fans fail to support the games because of the creativity they show .
<6>	(32.577-40.636)	unakuta mchezaji <breath> anafanya makosa lakini vile vile anakuja kurudia kwa wakati mwingine <breath> amba -- ambayo hiyo hali ni tofauti na ligi za ulaya .	you find a player commits a foul but then again comes to repeat same thing next time a situation which is different with European leagues .
<7>	(40.636-55.480)	<breath> Lakini kitu kingine ambacho ninaweza nikakitoa kama hoja kwamba naweza nikasema kwamba serikali nayo inahitaji <breath> itoe motivation au iwasapoti <breath> wachezaji au ligi hizi tulizonazo <hes> katika hii nchi yetu .	another thing I can give as a point I can say that the government should also give motivation or support the players or the leagues we have in our country .
<8>	(55.480-65.119)	ili ziweze kuboreka zaidi <breath> na hatimaye ziweze kuwa na kiwango sawa hata katika -- kama nchi au timu za nje ya nchi .	in order for them to improve more and finally have the same level even in -- like countries or teams from outside the country .
<9>	(65.119-65.919)	asanteni sana .	thank you very much .
<10>	(65.919-68.470)	asante sana Tunaendelea -- tunaendelea na kipindi hiki .	thank you so much we are are proceeding -- we are proceeding with this program .
<11>	(68.470-75.297)	Pale nyuma pale kuna dada pale anatusikiza kwa makini halafu ni mwanadada pekee kabisa ndani ya huu ukumbi <breath> amekuwa akisikiza hizi Mada kwa umakini kweli kweli .	behind there there is a sister listening to us carefully and she is the only lady in this hall she has been listening to these topics with great attention .
<12>	(75.297-88.580)	Hebu naomba tumpe mic ya upendeleo <breath> (()) tumsikie maoni yake hasa <breath> na atuambie hata yeye mwenyewe <breath> ni mshabiki wa timu gani hapa nyumbani na nje ya nchi <breath> halafu atueleze kinachomvutia hasa nje ya nchini nini <breath> ?	I request that we give her a microphone for favoritism (()) and listen to her opinion and particularly tell us which team she supports here at home and outside the country and then tell us what attracts her particularly outside the country ?
<13>	(88.580-90.610)	ahh mimi ni mshabiki wa Chelsea .	ahh I am a Chelsea fan .
<14>	(90.610-91.898)	na hapa nyumbani ?	and here at home ?
<15>	(91.898-92.810)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<16>	(92.810-95.343)	Hapa nyumbani nashabikia Simba .	here at home I support Simba .
<17>	(95.343-96.370)	karibu sana .	most welcome .
<18>	(96.370-105.594)	eh ahh <hes> kwa kuchangia kwangu kwamba <breath> kwa nini watu wengi tunapenda <no-speech> kwa -- tunapendelea mechi za nje kuliko za kwetu .	eh ahh in my contribution that why most people among us like on -- we favor foreign matches than our home ones .
<19>	(105.594-106.954)	mimi ninachoona ni kwamba %incomplete	what I see is that %incomplete
<20>	(106.954-121.458)	ni kama wenzangu walivyochangia <no-speech> kwamba ni kule -- ile imani potofu Kwamba Watanzania wengi <breath> tunakuwa tukiamini kwamba wale wa nje tu ndiyo wanaweza kufanya vizuri katika <no-speech> ligi hizi au katika michezo .	its like my fellows made contributions that there -- that misconception that most of us Tanzanians have been believing that only those outsiders have the ability to do well in these leagues or in sports .
<21>	(121.458-135.583)	na pia vile vile <breath> ukiangalia katika nchi za wenzetu huko nje wameendelea sana kutokana kwamba wana <no-speech> -- mambo ya michezo wana <hes> -- wanaipa kipau mbele sana <no-speech> ukitofautisha na huku Tanzania yaani sio sana vile .	and also if you look at other countries out there they have really advanced from the fact that they -- in sports matters they -- they prioritize sports matters differentiating from here in Tanzania it is not that much .
<22>	(135.583-141.241)	<breath> ijapokuwa nao sasa hivi naona wanaanza lakini sio sana vile ukitofautisha na nchi za wenzetu .	however I see they are also starting but it is not that much as it is in other countries .
<23>	(141.241-144.178)	na ndiyo maana unakuta wenzetu kule <breath> wanaendelea .	and that is why you find our fellows there progressing .
<24>	(144.178-163.743)	mimi ninachoona kinachotakiwa kufanyika katika nchi yetu hili la Tanzania la asili ligi zetu ziweze kuendelea ni kwamba kujaribu kuona kwamba michezo ni muhimu na michezo pia inasaidia <no-speech> katika kuinua taifa letu na kulifanya taifa letu nalo likaonekana ni kati -- miongoni wa taif- -- mataifa ambalo lina -- limeinuka kimichezo .	what I see is supposed to be done in our country Tanzania primarily for our leagues to be able to progress is to try to see that sports is important and sports is also helpful in raising our nation and to make our nation be seen to be among -- among nations -- a nation that has -- has developed in sports .
<25>	(163.743-170.271)	Yaani <breath> serikali kwa ujumla liangalie swala nzima la michezo ili kuipa kipau mbele na tuweze kuendelea asante .	that is the government in general to look into the whole issue of sports so that it gives it priority and that we may progress thank you .
<26>	(170.271-173.603)	Nakushukuru sana nakushukuru sana muda umekimbia kweli kweli <breath> .	I thank you so much . I thank you so much . time has really gone .
<27>	(173.603-174.529)	Naomba unipe dakika moja .	I request a minute from you .
<28>	(174.529-175.870)	nini kifanyike ?	for what to happen ?
<29>	(175.870-176.789)	nini kifanyike ?	for what to happen ?
<30>	(176.789-178.127)	kwa dakika moja tu .	for only one minute .
<31>	(178.127-186.549)	ili tuweze kupandisha soka na watu waweze kujua ina mvuto zaidi ni kwamba <no-speech> kwanza Shirika inayo simamia soka Tanzania T_F_F .	so as to improve soccer and for people to know it has more attraction first the organization managing soccer in Tanzania T_F_F .
<32>	(186.549-187.811)	Shirikisho .	federation .
<33>	(187.811-209.432)	Shirikisho ya soka waweze kutoa vile vikwazo kwamba labda timu fulani iwe inawasajili wachezaji labda watano kutoka nje ya nchi kwa sababu hata tukiangalia zile timu za ulaya ambazo wao wenyewe wanakuwa na wachezaji wengi <no-speech> kutoka nje ya nchi ambazo zinaleta changamoto katika mchezo inafanya kila mchezaji anajituma ili aweze kupata namba na wale wa ndani wanaweza kujituma zaidi .	the soccer federation can also give sanctions that maybe a certain team should be signing maybe five players from outside the country because even if we look at European teams which have most players from outside the countries that brings a challenge in the game makes each player to be committed to get a place and the homegrown can be more committed .
<34>	(209.432-212.891)	<breath> Kitu kingine ni kwamba <overlap> inatosha inatosha inatosha .	another thing is that it is enough enough enough .
<35>	(212.891-214.558)	Labda mtu mwingine wa <int> mwisho .	maybe one last person .
<36>	(214.558-223.240)	mimi naona kwamba kipi kifanyike katika kuinua michezo katika taifa letu ni kwamba kitu cha kwanza kabisa kinachohitajika ni uzalendo .	I see that what should be done to improve sports in our nation is that the very first thing required is patriotism .
<37>	(223.240-229.210)	Kwamba uzalendo kwa Watanzania wote <breath> na uzalendo kwa wachezaji pia uwepo .	that patriotism from all Tanzanians and patriotism from players should also be there .
<38>	(229.210-241.830)	kwa sababu <breath> tumekuwa na kasumba ya kwamba wachezaji baada tu ya muda fulani akichuja basi anakuwa ameondoka moja kwa moja katika timu ile <breath> na hatimaye kipaji chake kinakufa .	because we have had a legacy of players who just after some time when he ages then he immediately leaves the team and finally his talent dies .
<39>	(241.830-249.035)	kwa jambo jingine tujaribu kuwatumia hao wachezaji wa zamani <breath> ambao wamekwisha kupumzika katika michezo .	another thing we should try to use those former players who have already retired from the sports .
<40>	(249.035-252.367)	<breath> Tuwatumie hao kama ni nguzo ya kuinua michezo .	we should use them as pillars for improving sports .
<41>	(252.367-259.960)	<breath> kwa sababu hao wachezaji tumewasahau kutokana na kwamba wale walikuwa wakicheza zamani lakini ni mambo mengi ambayo wanayafahamu ya kimichezo .	because we have forgotten those players from the fact that they used to play in the times past but they know a lot about sports .
<42>	(259.960-263.673)	kwa hayo kwa taifa letu tuwatumie sana hawa wachezaji wa zamani .	with that in our nation let us use these former players a lot .
<43>	(263.673-269.747)	ikiwezekana na ma- -- makocha wa timu ndogo ndogo kama Academy tuwapate katika wachezaji hawa wa zamani asante sana .	if possible and the -- let us find coaches of small teams like academy coaches from these former players . thank you very much .
<44>	(269.747-270.994)	Nakushukuru sana nakushukuru sana .	thank you very much . thank you very much .
