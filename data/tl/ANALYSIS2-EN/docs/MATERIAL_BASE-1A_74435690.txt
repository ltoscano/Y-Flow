<1>	Tusiikamie sana Afcon 2019, tutafuzu siku ikifika	let's not be more anxious about AFCON 2019, we will qualify when the day arrives.
<2>	Takriban juma moja limepita tangu kuanza kwa mashindano makubwa kabisa barani Afrika kwa ngazi ya Taifa, Kombe la Mataifa ya Afrika ambayo sasa yako katika hatua za fainali nchini Gabon.	approximately one week has passed since the start of the biggest competition in the African continent at the national level African cup of nations that now is in final stage in Gabon.
<3>	Huku nyumbani, tumebaki kuwa watazamaji kama ambavyo tumetazama tangu tushiriki mara ya mwisho mwaka 1980, wakati huo likiitwa Kombe la Mataifa Huru Afrika.	here at home, we have remained as spectators as we have always watched since we last participated in 1980, though it was called the African cup of free nations.
<4>	Maswali na hoja za wadau ni lini timu yetu ya Taifa itapata nafasi ya kutuwakilisha kwenye michuano hii ya kikanda, ingawa nadhani swali linalofaa lingekuwa endapo tuna hadhi ya kucheza fainali za Afcon.	the questions and opinions of stakeholders is when will our national team get the opportunity to represent us in these football matches, even though I think a more suitable question should be if the status to play in the AFCON finals.
<5>	Kumbukumbu ya kufuzu mwaka 1980 nchini Nigeria bado ingali kichwani kwa wadau wengi wa soka, ikipimwa kama kilele cha mafanikio kwa soka yetu na kizazi kile.	the qualifying match in 1980 in Nigeria is still in the heads of many football stakeholders, it is measured as the peak of our success in football and of that generation.
<6>	Tusichojiuliza sana ni matokeo ambayo tuliyapata kwenye fainali zile na endapo tunaweza kujitutumua ikiwa tungefuzu tena miaka hii.	what we do not ask more is the result that we got in those finals and whether we can brag if we could have qualified again this year.
<7>	Stars ilitolewa katika hatua za awali kabisa michuano ya mwaka 1980, na `kizazi cha dhahabu'kinachohusishwa na na mafanikio yale hakijawahi tena kufuzu Afcon, si katika zama zao za kucheza, wala zama za ukocha na uongozi wa soka.	the Stars were removed in the early stages of the 1980 matches and the 'golden generation' which is linked to those successes have never qualified for AFCON again, not in their playing years nor in their coaching and football leadership years.
<8>	Tunaonekana kuyatukuza sana 'mafanikio' ya 1980, katika namna inayopitiliza kiasi kwamba tunasahau kuwa miaka hii tuna sababu nyingi zaidi za kufuzu kuliko miaka hiyo, endapo tu hatutakuwa na haraka hiyo.	we seem to praise a lot of the 'success' of 1980 in a way that is beyond limit so that we forget that these years we have many reasons to qualify in comparison to those years but only if we do not have that hurry.
<9>	Kwa kuwa Taifa Stars haijafuzu kwa miaka mingi mashindano ya Afrika, hamu yetu imekuwa walau kushiriki tu kwa mara nyingine na wala sio kuwa miongoni mwa timu bora Afrika zinatakazoshindana hasa kwenye fainali hizo.	because the Taifa Stars have not qualified for many years for the African competitions, our desire has been that if only we can participate another time and not to be among the best African teams competing especially in those finals.
<10>	Mwanzoni mwa uongozi wa Rais Jakaya Kikwete, msisitizo wa kwanza kwenye soka ulikuwa ni kuunda timu ya taifa imara na kufuzu Afcon 2008, jaribio ambalo lilishindwa hata baada ya kuundwa kwa kamati ya kusaka ushindi iliyoongozwa na aliyekuwa mbunge wa Singida Mjini, Mohamed Dewji.	at the beginning of President Jakaya Kikwete's leadership, the first emphasis on football was to form a strong national team and qualify for AFCON 2008, the test that failed even after forming a committee to hunt for victory which was led by the former member of parliament of Singida, Mohamed Dewji.
<11>	Licha ya juhudi zote za kiufundi na kisiasa, hatujafanikiwa bado kukata kiu yetu ya kushiriki Afcon na hadi sasa jinamizi lake linatuandama.	despite all of those technical and political efforts, we have not yet succeeded in fulfilling our desire to participate in AFCON and until now its nightmare still follows us.
<12>	Ndiyo, linatuandama kwa kuwa imefika hatua ya wadau kurushiana maneno kuhusu uhalali wa msanii Diamond Platinumz kupewa bendera ya Taifa alipokuwa anakwenda kutumbuiza kwenye sherehe za ufunguzi za Afcon mwaka huu.	yes it follows us because it has reached a stage where the stakeholders launching insults about the legality of artist, Diamond Platinumz, to be given the national flag when going to entertain in the AFCON opening ceremony this year.
<13>	Hiki ni kichekesho kutoka pande zote, kwani sidhani kama Shakira hukabidhiwa bendera ya Colombia na Serikali yake kila mara anapoalikwa kutumbuiza kwenye Kombe la Dunia.	this is a joke from all sides because I do not think Shakira is handed the Colombian national flag by her government whenever she is invited to entertain in the world cup.
<14>	Wakosoaji nao wana haki ya kusema, kwani kwa kitendo hicho ni kama vile Serikali inajificha kwenye kivuli cha Diamond baada ya kushindwa kukata kiu ya washabiki ambayo ni kuwakilishwa na timu yao ya Taifa kwenye mashindano, na si msanii aliyejitengeneza mwenyewe.	and critics also have the right to say that that deed is like the government is hiding behind Diamond's shadow after failing to quench the thirst of fans to be represented by their national team in the competitions and not an artist who is making it himself.
<15>	Namna bora na kisasa ya kufuzu Afcon ni kwa kutengeneza timu imara, na si kwa mipango ya kisiasa inayolenga kukamia tu kufuzu mashindano ya Afrika au hata ya dunia.	the best and current way of qualifying is by making a strong team and not by political plans that aims at only bragging about qualifying for African competitions or even the world cup.
<16>	Itazame Uganda kwa mfano, wao wamefanikiwa kumaliza kiu yao ya tangu 1978 ya kucheza Afcon lakini kila mdau wa soka anajua kuwa ile si kazi ya muda mfupi na ya kisiasa kama tunayojaribu kufanya sisi.	look at Uganda, for example, they have succeeded in quenching their thirst of playing in AFCON since 1978 but each football stakeholder knows that that is not a short-term task not political like the way we try to make it.
<17>	Kwa miaka kadhaa Uganda imepambana kuwa timu bora katika ukanda huu na safari yake Gabon ni ushahidi tosha.	for several years Uganda have struggled to be a good team in this region and its journey to Gabon is enough evidence.
<18>	Afcon ya mwaka 2019 nchini Cameroon imeshaanza kutazamwa kwa matamanio na Watanzania wa mlengo wenye kiu ya kufuzu tu, hasa baada ya kuona ratiba.	AFCON of 2019 in Cameroon is starting to be watched with a lot of exceptions by the Tanzanians desires to just qualify especially after seeing the timetable.
<19>	Bila shaka tunaweza kufuzu kwa ujanja ujanja wa kukamia mechi moja moja, tutafurahi kufuzu na kufuta aibu yetu ya miaka arobaini kasoro lakini tusitarajie matokeo tofauti na ya mwaka 1980, ukweli ni huo.	without doubt, we can qualify with the craftiness of boasting one match after another, to be happy for qualifying and wipe our shame of roughly forty years but let's not expect results better than that of 1980, that's the truth.
