<1>	(0.000-1.762)	na eneo hilo la mpakani .	and the area at the border .
<2>	(1.762-20.880)	je kuna <breath> taarifa nyingine yoyote ambao wametoa namna watakavyoweza kuimarisha usalama nchini humo <breath> na katika eneo la mpaka ili watu waweze <breath> kufanya biashara zao kwa Uhuru kwa amani <breath> na kujiona kwamba ni sehemu ya nchi yao wanastahiki kufanya kile wanachokifanya ?	is there any other report they have released on how they can improve the security of in the country and at the border areas so that people are able to do their business in freedom peace and feel it as part of their country deserving to do what they want to do ?
<3>	(20.880-22.318)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<4>	(22.318-22.695)	naam .	yes .
<5>	(22.695-38.146)	kwa mujibu wa msemaji wa Wizara ya usalama wa kwanza aliwaomba kwanza wawe wavumilivu <hes> kwa sababu wanasema <hes> kama hakuna usalama wa kutosha ni vigumu <hes> kufanya kazi yoyote ile .	according to the first spokesperson at the ministry of security he urged them to first be persevering because they are saying if there isn't enough security it is hard to do any work at all .
<6>	(38.146-45.560)	<hes> lakini wanasema mara tu baada ya kuhakikisha kwamba usalama umerejea ndipo watachukua hatua jingine .	but they are saying that they will take another measure the moment they are sure that the security has returned .
<7>	(45.560-67.630)	lakini hatua hii vile vile ya kusimamisha vyakula kuweza kupelekwa Rwanda ni hatua ambayo wanasema <hes> kuwahifa- -- <hes> kuwasaidia kuhifadhi mavuno kwa sababu kama nilivyoanza kusema kwa -- awali ni kuna tishio la mabadiliko ya hali ya hewa kwa mujibu wa wataalamu w- -- wa mabadiliko ya hali ya hewa hapa Burundi .	but the measure of stopping food entry into Rwanda is a measure they are saying that -- to help them reserve harvest because as I started by saying in the beginning there is a threat in the climatic changes according to the experts of climatic changes in Burundi .
<8>	(67.630-77.543)	wanasema kwamba pengine msimu huu wa (()) ukawa mrefu za- -- sana hadi Desemba au Februari mwaka ujao wa elfu mbili kumi na sita .	they are saying that the (()) season might be very long until December or February the next year two thousand and sixteen .
<9>	(77.543-103.803)	na sidhani kwamba hii hatua wataiachilia (()) <int> kwa mujibu wa wafanyabiashara wale nimezungumza nao wao wanasema wakizuia tu vyakula kama mchele mahindi na mihogo itakuwa mzuri zaidi kama hatua ambayo ilichukuliwa hivi karibuni na serikali ya Tanzania <hes> hadi sasa hakuna vyakula kama mchele mahindi na mihogo vinavyoagizwa kutoka Tanzania .	and I don't think that they will let go of this measure (()) according to the traders I have spoken to they say it will be better if they just block foods like rice maize and cassavas like the measure taken recently by the government of Tanzania and until now there are no foods like rice maize and cassavas being exported from Tanzania .
<10>	(103.803-111.282)	lakini huku Burundi <hes> serikali imechukua hatua ya kusimamisha nafaka zote za chakula .	but here in Burundi the government has taken a measure of stopping all food cereals .
<11>	(111.282-124.067)	lakini waku- -- wa- -- wa- -- wakulima ha- -- hao wafanyabiashara wana (()) chakula wao wanasema pengine serikali <int> ingeangalia vizuri ikasimamisha biasha- -- biashara kama mi- -- Michelle mahindi na mihogo .	but farmers -- those traders have (()) food they say maybe the government should look properly into stopping business like rice maize and cassavas .
<12>	(124.067-143.111)	lakini hivi kama mboga mboga nyanya msumaa na -- na -- na nyanya waache ziweze kuvushwa mipaka kwa sababu haziwezi -- hakuna kwanza kiwanda ambacho kinaweza kutengeneza <hes> biashara (()) <no-speech> nyanya au (()) kuhifadhi kwa muda mrefu (()) <no-speech> hivi .	but they should let vegetables like tomatoes greens and -- and -- and tomatoes get through the borders because they can't be -- there is no factory which can process business (()) tomatoes or (()) for sort of longer preservation (()) .
<13>	(143.111-155.630)	<hes> wao walikuwa wanapeleka Rwanda kwa sababu pale (()) kuna kiwanda ambacho kinauza kwa wingi kitu kama nyanya mishumaa <sta> na -- na nyanya kuweza ku- -- ku- -- kufunikwa vizuri .	they were taking to Rwanda because in (()) there is a factory which sells in wholesale things like tomatoes greens and -- and tomatoes are covered properly .
<14>	(155.630-158.073)	asante sana Haida Halakizimana .	thank you very much Haida Halakizimana .
