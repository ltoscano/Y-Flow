<1>	Migao ya faida kwa wakulima yapungua	farmers' dividends have reduced
<2>	KWA miaka miwili mfululizo, wakulima walio katika mashirika ya akiba na mikopo watapokea migao ya faida iliyopunguka kwa kiwango kikubwa kutokana na kusambaratika kwa sekta nyingi za kilimo nchini.	for the second year running, farmers from the credit and savings corporation will receive dividends that have been reduced by a big margin due to the declining farming sector in the country.
<3>	Watakaoathirika zaidi ni wakulima wa kahawa, majani chai, miwa, pamba na ndizi.	those who will be seriously affected are coffee, tea, sugarcane, cotton and banana farmers.
<4>	Haya ni kwa mujibu wa ripoti ya muungano wa wakulima wadogowadogo (KSSGA) inayoonyesha kuwa migao hiyo itakuwa ya kati ya Sh0.30 hadi Sh0.90 pekee kwa hisa moja.	this is according to the report issued by the union of small-scale farmers (KSSGA), which shows that dividends will be between 0.30 and 0.90 shillings only per share.
<5>	Hii ni kinyume na kiwango kilicholipwa mwaka wa 2012 ambapo wakulima walipata kiwango cha kati ya Sh3 na Sh5 kwa hisa, huku mkulima akihakikishiwa kupata asilimia 80 ya mapato kutoka soko.	this is less than what was paid in the year 2012, when farmers received between 3 and 5 shillings per share, and farmers were guaranteed to receive 80 percent of market earnings.
<6>	Mwenyekiti wa Muungano huo Bw Cleophas Mureithi alisema hali hiyo imechangiwa pakubwa na hali mbaya ya anga iliyopunguza mavuno, kuongezeka kwa ushuru wa serikali na pia ukosefu au kuyumba katika soko.	the union chairman, Mister Cleophas Mureithi, said that the situation has been largely contributed by the bad weather, which reduced the harvest, the increase in government taxes, and also the lack of or the swaying of the market.
<7>	“Ukiongeza ushindani mkuu ambao umezuka baada ya kuwekwa huru kwa soko la Jumuiya ya Afrika Mashariki (EAC), wakulima wa hapa nchini walijipata hoi huku bidhaa zenye bei rahisi zikifurika katika masoko yetu,” akasema.	"when you add the competition that has emerged after the opening of the East African Community (EAC) market, farmers in our country found themselves helpless as cheap goods flooded our markets," he said.
