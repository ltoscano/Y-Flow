<2>	Na MWANGI MUIRURI	by Mwangi Muiruri
<3>	Alisema kuwa hakuna dalili kuwa pato la mkulima wa kahawa litaimarika hivi karibuni huku walio katika safu ya mboga na matunda wakiendelea kuzoa faida kubwa.	he said that there is no sign that the income for coffee farmer's will improve soon while those in the arena of vegetables and fruits continue to scoop up large profits.
<4>	Akiongea katika eneo la Kakuzi katika Kaunti ya Murang’a, Bw Kamande alisema kuwa kwa sasa kilimo cha kahawa kimewageuza wenyeji wa eneo hilo kuwa masikini wa kusikitikiwa huku madalali na mitandao ya utapeli katika sekta hiyo ikiendelea kuzoa faida kubwa kutoka kwa jasho la mkulima.	while speaking at the Kakuzi district in Murang'a county, Mister Kamande said that currently, coffee farming has turned locals of the area into poor people to be sympathized while agents and conning networks in the sector continue to scoop huge profits from the sweat of the farmer.
<5>	“Tukizingatia kuwa tunfaa kuwa katika kilimo biashara, ni lazima tuangalie utenda kazi wa uwekezaji wetu kupitia ukadiriaji wa faida na hasara.	"if we consider that we should be in agribusiness, we must look into the performance of our investment through the estimation of profits and losses.
<6>	Ukiona hasara inazidi faida, ni bora kuwekeza kwingine,” akasema.	if you see that there are more losses than profits, it is better to invest elsewhere," he said.
<7>	Alisema kuwa kwa sasa wakulima wa kahawa wanalipwa kwa kati ya Sh10 na Sh30 kwa kilo moja ya kahawa ilihali kahawa hiyo hiyo ikifikishwa sokoni na madalali inauzwa kwa kati ya Sh450 na Sh500 kwa kipimo cha nusu kilo.	he said currently, coffee farmers are paid between 10 shillings and 30 shillings per kilogram of coffee, whereas, if that coffee was taken to the agents' market, it is sold for between 450 shillings and 500 shillings for half a kilogram.
<8>	“Huku mkulima akiendelea kusononeka akingoja malipo hayo duni, gharama ya uzalishaji inazidi kupanda.	"while the farmer continues being miserable, waiting for that inadequate payment, the cost of production continues to rise.
<9>	Kila mwanzo wa msiku wa kahawa, maafisa wa mashirika ya kahawa huzindua kampeni za kumhakikishia mkulima kuwa pato litaongezeka na kuwashinikiza watie bidii shambani ili mazao yaongezeke,” akasema.	at the start of every coffee season, the officers of the coffee companies launch campaigns to assure farmers that the harvest will increase and encourage them to work hard in the farms so that the harvest will increase," he said.
<10>	Alisema hii huwa ni njama tu ya viongozi hao wa mashirika ya kuwaweka wakulima hao katika imani ya uongo katika ukuzaji kahawa ilihali kile huwa kinalengwa ni kuhakikisha wakulima kuhakikisha wakulima hawatupilii mbali kilimo hicho ili faida zao haramu zisiangamie,” akasema.	he said that this is just a conspiracy of those company leaders to give false faith to the farmers in the growth of coffee, however, what they are aiming at is to ensure the farmers do not abandon farming so that their illegal profits do not get ruined," he said.
<11>	Alisema kuwa viongozi hao wa mashirika ya kahawa hawasaidii lolote kuzima njama za wizi wa kahawa na hakuna msukumo wa uhakika ambao hutekelezwa ili kuokoa sekta hiyo kutoka minyororo ya utumwa.	he said that those leaders from those coffee companies do not help in any way to stop the theft conspiracies and there is no big push to save the sector from the chains of slavery.
<12>	“Ni vyema sasa wakulima wa kahawa waamume kuwa hawataishi maisha hayo ya utumwa na watupilie mbali kilimo hicho na kuelekeza bidiii zao katika sekta mbadala,” akasema.	"it is good for the coffee farmers to decide that they will not live that life of slavery and abandon that sort of farming, directing their hard work to alternative sectors," he said.
