<1>	(0.000-1.279)	ametangulia mbele ya (()) .	he has gone before the (()) .
<2>	(1.279-17.335)	nirudi kwenye Mada kama inavyosema kwamba kifo cha Mash ni nini kifanyike ili tuhakikishe kwamba tunamuenzi ni dhahiri kwamba kama tunavyoifahamu historia ya Mash alikuwa ni mwanamichezo na jinsi ambavyo alikuwa anakiamini yaani (()) na hasa kuwasaidia vijana katika sector ya kimichezo .	I go back to the topic as I had said that following the death of Mash what should be done to demonstrate that we honor him it is evident as we know Mash's history he was an athlete and he really believed in it (()) and especially helping youths in the sports sector .
<3>	(17.335-17.900)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<4>	(17.900-26.820)	na alienda mbali na kuhakikisha kwamba akaanzisha sports Academy ambayo ni Mash Academy na ambayo iliweza kuwasaidia vijana wengi sana wa jiji la Mwanza na Watanzania wote kwa ujumla .	and he went further to ensure that he establishes a Sports Academy which is the Mash Academy and that helped so many youths of Mwanza town and all Tanzanians in general .
<5>	(26.820-33.280)	sasa kwa sisi kama Watanzania ambao sasa Mash ameweza kutuachia gurudumu la kuendeleza sector ya Michezo Tanzania .	now for us as Tanzanians whom Mash has left in charge of advancing the sports sector in Tanzania .
<6>	(33.280-40.140)	tuna kila sababu ya kuhakikisha kwamba tunayaenzi yale aliyo yaacha ikiwa ni pamoja na kuanzisha vituo mingi vya kimichezo Tanzania .	we have every reason to ensure that we honor all that he left behind including establishing many sports centers in Tanzania .
<7>	(40.140-46.140)	ni dhahiri kwamba Mash alikuwa ni mtu mmoja lakini aliweza kudhubutu na kuhakikisha kwamba akaanzisha kituo cha kimichezo .	it is evident that Mash was just an individual but he was able to dare and make sure that he starts a sports academy .
<8>	(46.140-52.350)	lakini sisi pia tukiwa kama Watanzania ambao tuna uwezo kama Mash wa kufikiria na kuyaenzi yale yote ambayo ameyaacha %incomplete	but us as Tanzanians who have the ability like Mash's of reasoning and honoring all that he has left behind %incomplete
<9>	(52.350-55.731)	tuna nafasi kubwa ya kuhakikisha kwamba tunaanzisha vituo vingi vya kimichezo Tanzania .	we have a big opportunity of ensuring that we establish many sports centers in Tanzania .
<10>	(55.731-55.980)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<11>	(55.980-57.657)	na hili linaanza kwa mtu mmoja mmoja .	and this begins at an individual level .
<12>	(57.657-58.262)	mimi nawe we .	me and you .
<13>	(58.262-64.130)	ni namna gani tunafikiria kuanzisha vituo vingi vya kimichezo ili tuweze kuwasaidia Watanzania wengi ambao wana uwezo wa kimichezo ?	how are we planning to initiate many sports centers to assist many Tanzanians who have sporting abilities ?
<14>	(64.130-71.331)	kwa hiyo ni dhahiri kwamba ili tuweze kuyaenzi yale ambayo Mash ameyafanya sio kwa maneno tu kwa kuzungumza mitaani kwamba Mash alikuwa na uwezo mkubwa Mash alifanyaje .	therefore it is evident that in order to honor all that Mash has done it should not only be in words uttering on the streets that Mash had great abilities how did Mash accomplish it .
<15>	(71.331-72.979)	tuna kila sababu ya kudhubutu .	we have every reason to dare .
<16>	(72.979-76.628)	kwamba tuna sasa sababu ya kuanzisha vituo vingi vya kimichezo .	that we now have a reason to start many sports academies .
<17>	(76.628-88.710)	tuweze kuwasaidia vijana ambao wana uwezo wa kimichezo <no-speech> na kwa kuzingatia kwamba Watanzania wengi tuna ndoto za kwenda kucheza nje lakini hatuwezi tukaenda kucheza nje wakati tukifikiria tuna miaka thelathini miaka thelathini na tano kitu ambacho hakiwezekani .	to be able to assist youths who have athletic skills and by considering that most of us Tanzanians have dreams of playing overseas but we cannot go to play abroad while considering we have thirty we have thirty-five years hence that cannot materialize .
<18>	(88.710-92.729)	kwa hivyo ni lazima tuanzishe vituo vya kimichezo kama alivyodhubutu Mash na kuanzisha kituo cha Academy .	therefore it is mandatory we establish sports centers as Mash dared and started a Sports Academy .
<19>	(92.729-98.852)	ili tuweze kuwafundisha vijana ambao wana uwezo -- wana umri -- angali umri mdogo kuanzia miaka mitano hadi miaka kumi na mbili .	so that we can train youths who have sporting abilities -- have the age -- at least young age from five to twelve years .
<20>	(98.852-102.457)	ili tuweze kupata Man_U ya mwaka kesho kutoka Tanzania .	so that we get a Man_U of tomorrow from Tanzania .
<21>	(102.457-112.754)	tuweze kutoa Watanzania ambao wataenda kucheza mchezo nje wakiwa wangali wana uwezo mdogo ili waweze kupata -- kuweza kuchezea timu kubwa za kimataifa na waweze kupata <hes> mafanikio makubwa ya kimichezo .	to be able to get Tanzanians who will go to play abroad while they still have modest abilities to be able to find -- to be able to play for big international teams and be in a position to obtain huge success in sports .
<22>	(112.754-116.805)	lakini kingine cha pili Mash alikuwa ni mkufunzi wa makocha .	and another second thing Mash was an instructor for the coaches .
<23>	(116.805-124.430)	<sta> ni dhahiri kwamba tuna -- tuna -- kama tulivyotangulia kusema meza kuu pale (()) mzee Louisa ambaye pia kimsingi ni watu ambao walikuwa ni watu wa karibu sana na Mash .	it is evident that we have -- we have -- as we had earlier said there at the high table (()) elder Louisa who also primarily are people who were very close to Mash .
<24>	(124.430-129.157)	tuna kila sababu ya kuhakikisha kwamba sasa na sisi tunatengeneza wakufunzi wengi wa kimichezo .	we have every reason to ensure that now we nurture many sporting instructors .
<25>	(129.157-135.900)	tuweze kupata makocha ambao wana uwezo mkubwa wa kuweza kuhakikisha kwamba watasimamia soka na michezo Tanzania .	so that we can get coaches who have great capacities to ensure that they will oversee soccer and sports in Tanzania .
<26>	(135.900-138.528)	kwa hiyo tuna kila sababu ya kuienzi yale ambayo ameyaacha .	therefore there is every reason to honor all that he has left behind .
<27>	(138.528-140.892)	kikubwa zaidi ni kuanzisha vituo vingi vya kimichezo .	more importantly is to establish many sporting centers .
<28>	(140.892-148.805)	lakini pia kuhakikisha kwamba tunapata walimu wa michezo wa kutosha <no-speech> sambamba nakupata makocha ambao wana uwezo mkubwa ili tuweze kupata wachezaji ambao wana uwezo mkubwa asanteni .	but also to ensure that we get enough sport's instructors consistent with getting coaches who have great abilities so that we can get players who have great potential thank you all .
<29>	(148.805-150.710)	nakushukuru sana msikilizaji asante sana tumpigie mako- %incomplete	I thank you so much listener thank you very much %incomplete
