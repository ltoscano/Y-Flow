<1>	(0.000-2.092)	shughuli hizi zote za malipo kwa wachezaji .	all these payment activities for the players .
<2>	(2.092-18.327)	<lipsmack> wachunguzi wengi sana wa ligi hii hawaoni kwamba swala la kiuchumi kumbe lina athari kubwa sana <breath> <hes> kitu ambacho wao wamekuwa wakikizungumza zaidi <hes> ni kuhusiana na sheria za uhamisho <breath> kwa watu ambao wako chini ya umri wa miaka <breath> <hes> kumi na tisa .	many league investigators do not see that the economic issue has very huge effects what they have been talking of more relates to the transfer regulations to people who are under nineteen years of age .
<3>	(18.327-23.885)	sasa kwa mfano endapo Uingereza leo <breath> ikajitoa katika <breath> <hes> ujumuia ya ulaya .	now for example in the event England removes itself from the European Union today .
<4>	(23.885-31.370)	<breath> <hes> kuna kipengele ambacho kinapatikana katika bara ya kumi na tisa <breath> ya taratibu za <breath> <hes> uhamisho wa wachezaji ?	there is a feature that is found in the nineteenth clause of the procedures on the transfer of players ?
<5>	(31.370-39.250)	na yenyewe inakataza kabisa na inapiga marufuku kabisa kwa mchezaji yeyote yule <breath> ambaye yupo chini ya umri wa miaka kumi na nane kusajiliwa na timu yoyote .	and it totally forbids and totally bans any player who is under eighteen years of age from being signed up by any team .
<6>	(39.250-57.044)	lakini sheria hii hii vile vile inampa nafasi <hes> ina- -- inazipa nafasi timu kuweza <hes> kusajili wachezaji ambao wako chini ya umri -- miaka kumi na nane endapo watakuwa wamekwenda Uingereza pengine na familia zao <breath> lakini haikuwa -- safari yao haikuwa na lengo la mtoto huyu <breath> kwenda kucheza mpira .	but this regulation at the same time gives a chance -- gives a chance to teams to be able to sign up players who are under the age of eighteen years if they will have gone to England perhaps with their families but it wasn't -- their journey had no intent of this child going to play soccer .
<7>	(57.044-80.644)	lakini vile vile kipengele cha pili ambacho kinawaruhusu <hes> watu ambao wako chini ya umri wa miaka kumi na -- na nane kuweza kuche- -- kucheza <hes> ligi ya -- ya Uingereza ni kwamba <breath> lazima mtoto huyu ambaye yuko <int> chini ya miaka na nane <breath> lazima awe amekwenda <hes> katika <hes> ametoka katika nchi ya Umoja wa ulaya au nchi ambayo ipo katika eneo la kiuchumi <breath> la ulaya .	but similarly the second clause which allows people who are under eighteen years of age to be able to play in the English league is that the child under eighteen years must have gone must come from an European Union country or a country that is within the European economy .
<8>	(80.644-87.955)	na hapa ndiyo wachezaji wengi sana ambao <breath> wameweza kucheza ligi ya Uingereza wakiwa na umri wa miaka kumi na nane nakufanya uhamisho <breath> kutoka sehemu nyingine .	and this is where many players have been able to play in the English league at the age of eighteen years and transferred from other areas .
<9>	(87.955-96.950)	kwa mfano kama <breath> <hes> Cesc Fabregas ambaye Omare amemzungumzia mwaka wa elfu mbili na tatu <int> <breath> alihamishwa kutoka Barcelona kwenda Arsenal <breath> <hes> kwa mfumo huu huu .	for example Cesc Fabregas who Omare has talked of in the year two thousand and three was transferred from Barcelona to Arsenal under the same system .
<10>	(96.950-109.681)	kwa hiyo kwamba yeye anatoka nchi ambayo ipo katika <breath> eneo la kiuchumi la u- -- la -- la ulaya . <breath> lakini kwa sasa hivi kwa mfano kuna wachezaji kama <breath> <hes> Adnan Januzaj wa Ubelgiji .	as he therefore comes from a country that is within the economic region of Europe but at the moment there are examples like Adnan Januzaj of Belgium .
<11>	(109.681-112.360)	huyu anachezea sasa hivi Manchester United <breath> .	this one currently plays for Manchester United .
<12>	(112.360-115.056)	ni mchezaji ambaye ana asili ya Ubelgiji .	he is a player whose origin is Belgium .
<13>	(115.056-119.376)	lakini Manchester United walimchukua <breath> akiwa chini ya umri wa miaka kumi na nane .	but Manchester United took him when he was under eighteen years of age .
<14>	(119.376-125.490)	sasa ameweza kucheza Manchester United kwa sababu <breath> nchi yake ipo ndani ya <breath> Umoja wa ulaya .	he has now been able to play Manchester United because his country is within the European Union .
<15>	(125.490-133.670)	endapo Uingereza itajitoa ina maana mchezaji huyu <breath> <hes> hatoruhusiwa leo hii kucheza timu ya Manchester United au kufanya uhamisho <breath> wowote ule <int> .	should England remove itself it means this player will not be allowed today to play in any Manchester United team or to make any sort of transfer .
<16>	(133.670-138.293)	<breath> kwa hakika najua mmeangalia mambo mengi kuhusu swala hili kwa kina <breath> .	for sure I know you have looked at many things regarding this issue in depth .
<17>	(138.293-152.385)	lakini kuna kitu ningetaka kuguzia kwanza kwamba wakala wa mchezo wa soka kutoka Uingereza Rachel Anderson kupitia tovuti la B_B_C anasema kuwa <breath> karibu nusu ya wachezaji wa Premier League sasa watahitaji vibali maalum ili kucheza wakiwa Uingereza .	but there is something I would like to touch on first that Rachel Anderson the soccer agent from England through the B_B_C website says that about half of the premier league players now will need special permits to play in England .
<18>	(152.385-158.162)	<breath> hata hivyo anasema hivi <breath> kuwa labda hali hiyo itapelekea kutafutwa kwa talanta za ndani ya nchi .	she however says that perhaps this situation will lead to a search of talent within the country .
<19>	(158.162-165.350)	sasa anasema <breath> labda ndiyo mwanzo ama mwamko mpya kwa Uingereza <breath> kupata wachezaji wake <int> wa nyumbani <lipsmack> .	she now says perhaps it is the beginning or a new era for England to get its players from home .
<20>	(165.350-178.259)	ni kweli kwa sababu <hes> kama <hes> hizi sheria zitachukua mkondo wake <breath> hii inamaanisha kwamba sasa Uingereza sasa wataanza <hes> <lipsmack> kuwa na mwelekeo kwamba vijana wao pale -- pale Uingereza wapewe nafasi zaidi .	it is true because if these rules take effect this now means that England will now start having a new directive that their youths should be given more chances there and then .
<21>	(178.259-193.640)	<breath> <hes> ni swala ambalo nafikiri itachukua muda sana <breath> lakini pia <hes> inaweza kuwapa nafasi kubwa Waingereza kwa sababu <hes> tumeona kwamba <breath> <lipsmack> <hes> mwagiko <int> wa wageni wengi sana na wachezaji wengi kutoka nchi nyingine <breath> <hes> wamekuwa wakifika Uingereza <breath> .	it is a matter which I think will take much time but it might also give the English a big chance because we have seen that the influx of many visitors and players from other countries have been arriving in England .
<22>	(193.640-202.540)	na <int> kuna watu wengi sana ambao walikuwa wame- -- wamesema na wamezungumza sana <breath> <hes> swala hili kwamba linazuia wachezaji wengi wadogo wa Uingereza kupata nafasi <breath> .	and there are many people who had said and talked a lot that this issue is blocking many young players from England from getting a chance .
<23>	(202.540-208.480)	kwa hiyo pia ukiangalia kwa namna hiyo nafikiri itakuwa nafasi nzuri kwa wachezaji wengi wa Uingereza <breath> .	and therefore if you look at it that way I think this will be a good opportunity to many English players .
<24>	(208.480-222.400)	na -- na pia itakuwa na -- <breath> <lipsmack> itakuwa ni kitu ambacho kitaisaidia timu ya taifa ya Uingereza ambayo inaonekana <hes> kwamba inakosa wakati mwingine vijana wa pale pale Uingereza kutokana na <breath> -- na wachezaji wengi sana wanaocheza katika ligi ile ni wageni .	and it will also have -- it will also be something that will help the England national team which sometimes seems to be lacking youths from England since many players in that league are foreigners .
<25>	(222.400-250.425)	na athari nyingine ambayo <hes> Harrison Kamau inaweza kuonekana ni kwamba <breath> <hes> pamoja kwamba Uingereza itakuwa ikiwapa fursa wachezaji wake wa ndani <breath> kuweza kushiriki lakini wachezaji wa kutoka mataifa mengine <breath> <hes> hasa ya ndani ya ulaya <breath> watakuwa wana kazi kubwa zaidi kwa sababu <breath> sheria iliyopo sasa hivi katika ligi ya Uingereza <breath> ili mchezaji aweze kusajiliwa <int> ambaye anatoka katika nchi <breath> si mwanachama wa jumuia ya ulaya eh <breath> kuna vitu vi- -- karibu vinne inabidi awe navyo .	and the other effect which Harrison Kamau is being seen is that alongside England giving its local players chances to participate players from other nations especially those inside Europe will have a bigger job because with the current laws for a player from a non European Union country to be signed up into the English league yes there are things that he must have .
<26>	(250.425-266.133)	kwa hiyo <breath> lazima kwanza lazima awe anatoka nchi <breath> ambayo katika kiwango cha FIFA lazima iwe katika kumi bora <breath> na lazima awe amecheza asilimia thelathini <hes> ya michezo ya kimataifa yaani na timu yake ya taifa <breath> ili aweze kupata kibali kucheza ligi ya Uingereza .	therefore he first of all must be from a top ten country in the FIFA standards and he must have played in thirty percent of international games in his national team to get the permit to play in the English league .
<27>	(266.133-266.320)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<28>	(266.320-280.659)	lakini vile vile lazima <hes> mchezaji huyu kama anatoka <breath> <hes> timu ambayo -- ama nchi ambayo ipo katika kiwango cha FIFA <breath> <hes> kuanzia namba kumi na moja hadi ishirini lazima awe amecheza <breath> <hes> asilimia karibu arobaini na tano ya michezo ya kimataifa na timu yake ya taifa .	but at the same time if this player is coming from a team or country that is within the FIFA standards he must have played numbers eleven to twenty in about forty-five percent of the international games under his national team .
<29>	(280.659-280.700)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<30>	(280.700-296.650)	lakini vile vile kuna ongezeko la asilimia <breath> sitini <hes> kwa nchi kumi zaidi kuanzia kati ya ishirini mpaka thelathini na vile vile lazima <breath> awe amecheza michezo hiyo na sabini na tano kwa <breath> <hes> timu ambazo zipo katika kiwango cha FIFA kuanzia thelathini na tano <breath> mpaka hamsini .	but at the same time there is a sixty percent increase in ten more countries from between twenty to thirty and at the same time he must have played those matches with seventy-five and thirty-five to fifty for the teams that are within the FIFA standards .
<31>	(296.650-308.530)	sasa ukiangalia wachezaji wengi sana ambao wanacheza hivi sasa <breath> <hes> barani ulaya kwa mfano kama N'golo Kante <breath> ambaye alichezea Leicester City hivi sasa ni mchezaji wa timu ya taifa ya Ufaransa <breath> <lipsmack> asingeweza kucheza Uingereza <breath> .	if you look at many players who are playing now in the European continent for example N'golo Kante who played for Leicester City who is now a player for the national team of France he wouldn't have been able to play for England .
<32>	(308.530-326.394)	na endapo sheria hii kama itapitishwa na wakasema kwamba <breath> sasa Uingereza haipo tena katika jumuia ya ulaya na hakuna makubaliano maalum <breath> kwa ajili ya haya <breath> wachezaji ambao wako wengi kule kweli katika ligi hiyo hawataweza kupata kibali <breath> cha kucheza mpira Uingereza . <int> unaendelea kusikiliza <int> haya yote .	and should this kind of law be passed and say that England is no longer in the European Union and there are no special changes for the sake of these players who are truly many in that league then they will not be able to get the permit to play football in England are you listening to all this .
