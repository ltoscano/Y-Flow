<4>	SIMBA jana ilizidi kujiimarisha kileleni mwa msimamo wa Ligi Kuu baada ya kuifunga Mbao FC bao 1-0 katika mechi iliyochezwa kwenye Uwanja wa Uhuru Dar es Salaam.	Simba FC yesterday further strengthened their position at the top of the Premier League after defeating Mbao FC 1-0 in the match that was played at the Uhuru stadium in Dar es Salaam.
<5>	Ushindi huo umeifanya Simba kufikisha pointi 26 katika mechi 10 ilizocheza, ikiongoza kwa tofauti ya pointi sita dhidi ya Stand United iliyo nafasi ya pili na pointi 20.	the win has made Simba FC move to 26 points in 10 matches played, leading with six points against Stand United, which is in second position with 20 points.
<6>	Hata hivyo Simba ililazimika kupata bao hilo ‘jioni’ mwa mchezo huo kwani Mbao waliwabana kuanzia mwanzo wa mchezo na kama washambuliaji wake wangekuwa makini, wangevunja mwiko kwa kuwafunga vinara hao.	however, Simba FC were forced to score in the dying minutes of the game because Mbao FC dominated the game from the beginning, and if their attacking players were careful in the goal, then it would have been a taboo, because they would have scored against the league leaders.
<7>	Jana hakuwa Shizza Kichuya tena wala Ibrahim Ajib waliozoeleka kuipa Simba mabao, bali kazi hiyo ilifanywa na Mzamiru Yassin katika dakika ya 88.	yesterday neither Shizza Kichuya nor Ibrahim Ajib, who are used to scoring goals for Simba FC, were available for selection, but the goal scoring was done by Mzamiru Yassin in the 88th minute.
<8>	Mzamiru alifunga bao hilo baada ya kuunganisha pasi ya Fredrick Blagnon na kuzusha shangwe kwa mashabiki wa Simba ambao walionekana walikwishakata tamaa ya kupata pointi zote tatu.	Mzamiru scored after connecting well with the pass from Fredrick Blagnon, and Simba FC fans erupted with joy and celebration after already being seen to have given up on getting all three points at stake.
<9>	Kwa ujumla Mbao iliisumbua Simba katika mechi hiyo ikionekana kuwashambulia huku ikiwa imekamilika kila idara.	overall, Mbao FC dominated Simba FC in the match, and they went on the offensive several times and were well-organized in all areas of play.
<10>	Dakika ya 17 ya mchezo huo Simba ilikosa mabao kupitia kwa washambuliaji wake Laudit Mavugo, Kichuya na Ajib ambao mabeki wa Mbao walihakikisha hawachezi nao mbali ili wasilete madhara langoni mwao.	in the 17th minute of the game, Simba missed goals shot by its strikers Laudit Mavugo, Kichuya and Ajib, and the Mbao defenders made sure they marked them to limit them from getting shots at their goal.
<11>	Mzamiru nusura aiandikie Simba bao katika dakika ya 21 lakini mpira aliopiga ulipaa juu ya goli.	Mzamiru came close to clinching the opener for Simba in the 21st minute but the shot was off target.
<12>	Dakika moja baadaye Hussein Swedi wa Mbao akatengeneza nafasi ya kwanza ya bao lakini akashindwa kujiamini na mabeki wa Simba wakaunasa mpira na kuuondoa kwenye eneo la hatari.	a minute later Hussein Swedi of Mbao created the first attempt on goal but he lacked confidence in dispatching his shot on goal and the Simba defenders were quick to clear the ball away from their area.
<13>	Kwa matokeo hayo, Mbao inayocheza Ligi Kuu kwa mara ya kwanza imebaki katika nafasi ya nane kwenye msimamo ikiwa na pointi 12 katika mechi 11 ilizocheza.	these results mean that Mbao is playing in the Premier League for the first time, and is stuck in eighth place on the table with 12 points from 11 games played.
