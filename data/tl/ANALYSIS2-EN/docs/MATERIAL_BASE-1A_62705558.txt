<4>	SERIKALI imepiga marufuku vitendo vinavyofanywa na baadhi ya wawekezaji wasio waaminifu waliopewa vibali vya kuchimba madini kuwahamisha wananchi katika maeneo ya uchimbaji bila kuwalipa fidia.	the government has put a ban on actions being done by some of the unfaithful investors who were given mining permits, moving citizens from the mining areas without paying them compensation.
<5>	Akizungumza jana katika mkutano wa kusikiliza kero za wananchi, Waziri wa Ardhi, Nyumba na Maendeleo ya Makazi, William Lukuvi alisema ni marufuku kuwaondoa wananchi katika nyumba na maeneo yao bila fidia kumpisha mwekezaji.	while speaking yesterday at a meeting to listen to the troubles of citizens, the minister of land, housing and settlement development, William Lukuvi said it is illegal to remove citizens from the houses and their areas without compensation to give way to the investor.
<6>	Alisema wananchi wasinyang'aywe, wasivunjiwe nyumba au kuondolewa kwa nguvu bila kupewa haki yao inayofanana na thamani ya mali zao zilizopo eneo lenye mgodi siyo fidia ya kupunza wananchi.	he said citizens should not be annexed and their houses should not be destroyed or removed by force without being given their right similar to the value of their assets that are in the mining area, not a compensation of ignoring citizens.
<7>	Pia aliwatahadhalisha wananchi kuwa hawana uwezo wa kukataa kuhamishwa katika eneo lenye mgodi bali kinachotakiwa ni wananchi kupata fidia zinazostahili ili wakaanzishe maisha mapya sehemu nyingine.	he also warned the citizens that they have no ability to resist being moved from the mining area but what is required is for the citizens to get the required compensation so as to start a new life elsewhere.
<8>	Kauli hiyo ya waziri wa ardhi imetolewa baada ya kupokea malalamiko kutoka kwa wananchi wilayani Kishapu kuwa wamekuwa wakilazimishwa kuhama katika maeneo yao baada ya wawekezaji kupewa kibali cha kuchimba madini na kuwalazimisha wahame kwenye makazi yao bila kulipwa fidia.	the statement by the minister was made after receiving complaints from the citizens of Kishapu District that they were being forced to move from their areas after the investors were given a mining permit forcing them to move from their residences without compensation.
