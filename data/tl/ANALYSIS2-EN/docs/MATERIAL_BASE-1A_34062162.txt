<5>	Rufaa ya Mkurugenzi wa Mashtaka (DPP) dhidi ya mwenyekiti wa kampuni inayoshughulikia uwekezaji wa mitaji na dhamana (Egma), Harry Kitilya na wenzake, maofisa waandamizi wa Benki Stanbic Tanzania, Shose Sinare na Sioi Solomon imebaki njia panda baada ya washtakiwa hao kuiwekea pingamizi.	the Director of the Public Prosecution's (DPP) appeal against the chairman of the company concerned with capital investment and securities (Egma), Harry Kitilya and colleagues, senior officials of the Stanbic Bank Tanzania, Shose Sinare and Sioi Solomon, is stuck at a crossroads after the defendants placed an objection.
<6>	DPP alikata rufaa Mahakama Kuu, Kanda ya Dar es Salaam kupinga uamuzi wa Mahakama ya Hakimu Mkazi Kisutu kuwafutia washtakiwa hao shtaka la utakatishaji fedha, kati ya mashtaka manane yanayowakabili.	DPP appealed to the High Court in Dar es Salaam to oppose the ruling of the Resident Magistrate Court, which cleared the accused of the charges of money laundering, one of the eight charges they are facing.
<7>	Rufaa hiyo ilitarajiwa kusikilizwa jana lakini ilikwama baada ya washtakiwa kuipinga wakidai kuwa Mahakama Kuu haina mamlaka ya kuisikiliza wala kufanya marekebisho yoyote ya uamuzi wa Mahakama ya Kisutu.	the appeal was expected to be heard yesterday but was halted after the defendants opposed it, claiming that the High Court has no jurisdiction to hear or make any adjustments to the decision by the Magistrates Court.
<8>	Katika hoja zao za pingamizi, Wakili Alex Mgongolwa kwa niaba ya mawakili wenzake, Dk Ringo Tenga na Majura Magafu, alisema uamuzi wa Mahakama ya Kisutu kufuta shtaka hilo hauwezi kukatiwa rufaa kwa kuwa si uamuzi ambao umemaliza au umehitimisha kesi hiyo.	in their objection arguments, lawyer Alex Mgongolwa, on behalf of his fellow lawyers, Doctor Ringo Tenga and Majura Magafu, said that the decision by Magistrate Court to clear the charge cannot be appealed, because it is not a decision that has been concluded, nor has the case been finalized.
<9>	Akijibu hoja hizo, Wakili wa Serikali Mkuu (PSA) Timon Vitalis akisaidiana na Shadrack Kimaro na Theofil Mutakyawa alisema Mahakama hiyo ina mamlaka kamili ya kuisikiliza kwa kuwa uamuzi wa kufuta shtaka la kutakatisha fedha umeliondoa kabisa shauri mahakamani na hakuna namna nyingine ya kuwashtaki kwa shtaka hilo zaidi ya kukata rufaa.	while answering to the arguments, Attorney General (PSA) Timon Vitalis, assisted by Shadrack Kimaro and Theofil Mutakyawa, said that the court has the full authority to hear it because the decision to revoke the charges of money laundering has completely removed the counsel in court, and there is no other way to prosecute them for that offense other than appealing.
<10>	Nyongeza Mbali na shtaka hilo, washtakiwa hao wanakabiliwa na mashtaka mengine saba ya kughushi, kuwasilisha nyaraka za uongo katika mamlaka za Serikali na kujipatia fedha kwa njia za udanganyifu wakati wa mchakato wa mkopo wa Dola za Marekani 550 milioni kwa Serikali ya Tanzania kutoka Benki ya Standard ya Uingereza.	in addition to the charge, the accused are faced with seven other charges of forgery, submitting false documents to government authorities and obtaining money by fraud during the processing of 550 million American dollars to the Tanzanian government from the Standard Bank of the UK.
