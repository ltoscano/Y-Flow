<1>	Waendesha mashtaka Temeke wanatudai rushwa	the prosecutors in Temeke are demanding bribes.
<2>	Sisi mahabusu ambao kesi zetu zinaendelea katika Mahakama ya Wilaya ya Temeke, tunapaza sauti zetu ili Serikali ishughulikie huu ukiukwaji wa maadili unaofanywa na waendesha mashtaka.	we prisoners whose cases continue at the Temeke District Court are raising our voices so that the government can deal with this violation of ethics occurring by the prosecutors.
<3>	Wanatulazimisha sisi mahabusu tutoe rushwa za fedha, kuwapeleka kula chakula cha mchana na kuweka mafuta kwenye magari yao.	we prisoners are being forced to give financial bribes, taking them for lunch and fueling their cars.
<4>	Ifahamike wazi kwamba sisi mahabusu wa makosa ya jinai hapa Temeke kutoka mahabusu mbalimbali hatuna malalamiko na waheshimiwa mahakimu kwa kuwa wanaonekana kuendesha kesi kwa haki, lakini wengi wa waendesha mashtaka wanadai tukiwapa hizo rushwa wataweka mambo sawa ili tusifungwe.	it should be known that we prisoners of criminal cases here in Temeke from different prisons have no complaints against the honorable judges because they appear to be running the cases justly, but many prosecutors are saying that if we bribe them, they will put things in order so that we are not imprisoned.
<5>	Wanatutishia tusipotoa rushwa watatufunga jela au kurefusha kesi zetu.	they are threatening to imprison us or lengthen our cases if we do not give them bribes.
<6>	Hata pale mahakama inapotupa dhamana, hawatoi `removal order' hadi wapewe rushwa.	even when the court gives us a bond, they do not issue a removal order until they are bribed.
