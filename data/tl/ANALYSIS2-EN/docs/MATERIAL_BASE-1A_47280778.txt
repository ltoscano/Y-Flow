<1>	Van Gaal: Huenda ikatuchukua Mwaka Mzima Kuepuka Madhila Haya ya Aibu Kwa Team ya Man United	Van Gaal: it might take us a whole year to avoid these shameful runs for Man United
<2>	Meneja wa klabu ya Man Utd Aloysius Paulus Maria van Gaal amelia na kikosi chake ambacho usiku wa kuamkia hii leo kiliendelea kula msoto wa kutopata matokeo mazuri tangu msimu wa soka huko nchini Uinmgereza ulipoanza August 16.	Man United club manager Aloysius Paulus Maria Van Gaal has cried about his squad which last night continued to eat the lack of good results since the English premier league began on August 16.
<3>	van Gaal amesema kikosi chake hakikucheza vizuri wakati wa mchezo wa michuano ya kombe la ligi dhidi ya klabu ya Milton Keynes Dons ambao waliibuka na ushindi wa mabao manne kwa sifuri na kuwatupa nje ya michuano hiyo mashetani wekundu.	Van Gaal has said his squad didn't play well in the league match against Milton Keynes Dons club, who emerged victorious by four goals to zero to eliminate the red devils from the competition.
<4>	van Gaal amesema makosa ya kipuuzi yaliyofanywa na wachezaji wake hususan waliocheza safu ya ulinzi yalikuwa chagio kubwa kwa wapinzani wao kupata mabao kwa urahisi, hivyo hana budi kuwasilisha lawama zake kwa wachezaji aliokuwa amewapa jukumu la kucheza hapo jana.	Van Gaal says that the foolish mistakes committed by his players, especially the defenders, created great opportunities for their opponents to get goals easily, and so he can't help but blame the players who he had given the responsibility of playing yesterday.
<5>	Wakati huo huo van Gaal amesema bado anaendelea na falasafa yake ya kutengeneza mazingira mapya ya kikosi na anaamini mpango huo utafanikiwa licha ya kupita kwenye mazingira magumu katika kipindi hiki cha mwanzoni mwa msimu wa mwaka 2014-15.	at the same time Van Gaal has said that he is continuing with his philosophy of making a new environment for the squad and he believes that his plans will be successful despite going through a difficult time in the early part of the 2014-15 season.
<6>	Amesema suala hilo linapaswa kufahamika hata kwa mashabiki wa Man Utd ambao wanahitaji kuona mafanikio yanapatikana kwa haraka haraka, lakini yeye kama meneja anatambua kipindi hiki cha mpito kinaweza kuchukua muda mrefu.	he has said that the issue should be known, even to the Man United fans who need to see success quickly, but as a manager he recognizes that this transitional period can take a long time.
