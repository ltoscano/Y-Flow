<1>	Simba Saba Hifadhi ya Serengeti wauawa Kwa Kulishwa Sumu	seven lions in Serengeti Reserve killed by poisoning
<2>	Simba saba wamekutwa wamekufa Hifadhi ya Jamii ya Ikona (WMA) wilayani Serengeti, mkoani Mara baada ya mfugaji mmoja wa Kijiji cha Park Nyigoti kudaiwa kuwatega kwa sumu, kufuatia ng’ombe wake mmoja kukamatwa malishoni ndani ya hifadhi hiyo.	"seven lions have died in the Ikona community-based wildlife management area in the Serengeti district in Mara province after a herder from Park Nyigoti village allegedly trapped them with poison after one of his cows was attacked while grazing within the reserve."
<3>	Tukio hilo lilibainika juzi ndani ya hifadhi hiyo Kijiji cha Park Nyigoti, baada ya mfugaji huyo Manyeresa Nguhecha akiongozana na askari wa Pori la Akiba la Ikorongo na walinzi wa Kampuni ya Grumeti Reserves na kukuta mizoga hiyo wakati akifuatilia eneo ambako ng’ombe alikamatiwa.	"the incident was discovered two days ago in the park at Park Nyigoti village. the herder Manyeresa Nguhecha was led by Ikorongo wildlife reserve guards and Grumeti Reserve guards and found the carcasses while following the area where the cow was grabbed."
<4>	Mwenyekiti wa jumuiya hiyo, Elias Chama akiwa eneo la tukio alisema juzi jioni simba walimuua ng’ombe wa mfugaji huyo, lakini walifanikiwa kuwafukuza kabla hawajaanza kula nyama.	"at the scene, the community chairman Elias Chama said that two days ago, in the evening, the lions killed the herder's cow, but they managed to chase them away before they started eating the meat."
<5>	Chama alidai kuwa gharama ya simba kwa uwindaji wa kitalii ni Sh25 milioni, hivyo wangewindwa wangeingiza Sh175 milioni.	"Chama claimed that the price of lion trophy-hunting is 25 million shillings, and so had they been hunted, they would have brought in 175 million shillings."
<6>	Mtuhumiwa anadaiwa kutoroka kwa kutumia pikipiki na kwamba, alikuwa miongoni mwa wanachama wa jumuiya hiyo waliojitokeza kugombea nafasi ya mwenyekiti na baadaye alijitoa.	"the suspect is claimed to have run off using a motorbike and was apparently among the members of the community who came out to vie for the position of chairman and later pulled out."
<7>	Madaktari wa Mifugo Wilaya ya Serengeti, Tito Kagize na Ahmed Lugelo walisema sumu hiyo ilisababisha damu kuvujia ndani ndiyo.	"Tito Kagize and Ahmed Lugelo, veterinarians in Serengeti district, said that the poison caused hemorrhaging."
<8>	“Tunahisi ni sumu maana dalili zake zipo, kwanza vifo vya wanyama wengi kwa muda mfupi, chanzo cha vifo ni kimoja wamekula nyama ya ng’ombe na inaonekana walikula zaidi kitoto cha ndama,	"we think that it is poison because the signs are there, especially the deaths of many animals in a short period, the cause of death one they have eaten cow meat and it is most likely they ate a calf,

<10>	Hata hivyo, msako ulioendeshwa na polisi nyumbani kwa mtuhumiwa unadaiwa kukuta ngozi ya ng’ombe iliyoraruliwa, nyama iliyokuwa imebaki na chupa moja iliyokuwa na harufu ya sumu ambayo haijajulikana.	however, a search carried out by the police in the suspect's home is claimed to have uncovered torn cow skin, meat remains and a bottle that had the smell of the unknown poison.
