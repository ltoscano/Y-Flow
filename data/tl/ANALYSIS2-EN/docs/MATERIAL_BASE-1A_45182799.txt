Edward Lusekelo was shot in the ribs and in the arm following chaos between residents and police.
<4>	Akizungumza na mwandishi wa habari hizi jana Kamanda wa Polisi Mkoa wa Tanga, Constatine Masawe, alisema tukio hilo lilitokea Kata ya Lwande ambapo mgambo huyo Mbwana Mgonje aliuawa kwa kushambuliwa kwa mapanga na kundi la wananchi waliokuwa wanapinga mwenzao kulipishwa ushuru wa kijiji.	speaking to this writer yesterday, police commander of Tanga province, Constatine Masawe said the incident happened in Lwande division where the militia Mister Mgonje was killed by being attacked with machetes by a group of residents who were disapproving one of their own being taxed for the village.
<5>	“Wananchi wa Kijiji cha Lwande wamemuua mgambo, Salum Mgonje, baada ya kushambuliwa kwa mapanga na kundi la wananchi waliokuwa wanapinga mfanyabiashara kukamatwa kwa kutolipa ushuru wa zao la iliki na Serikali ya kijiji,” alisema.	"residents of Lwande village have killed militia Salum Mgonje, after being attacked by a group of residents with machetes who were protesting the arrest of a businessman for not paying tax for cardamom produce by the local government," he said.
<6>	“Mfanyabiashara huyo alinunua iliki hiyo kijiji cha Lulago kilichopo kata hiyo, lakini baada ya kukataa kulipa ushuru huo walitumwa mgambo ili kwenda kumlazimisha alipe, ndipo wananchi hao wakamkata mapanga mtu huyo na kufariki,” alisema Masawe.	"the businessman bought the cardamom from Lulago village in that ward, but after refusing to pay the tax, militia were sent in order to force him to pay. that is when the citizens hacked that person to death with machetes," said Masawe.
<7>	Masawe alisema mara baada ya kutokea kwa tukio hilo, askari polisi walifika juzi Oktoba 23 kwenye kijiji hicho, lakini bila kutarajia walishambuliwa kwa risasi na wananchi hao.	Masawe said soon after the incident, police officers arrived at the village on October 23rd but without warning they were attacked by the residents with gunfire.
<8>	Katika tukio hilo walimjeruhi kwa kumpiga risasi ya mbavuni na mkononi Lusekelo ambaye kwa sasa amelazwa kwenye Hospitali ya Rufaa ya Bombo jijini Tanga.	during that incident, they injured Lusekelo by shooting him in the ribs and arm. he is now admitted to Bombo referral hospital in Tanga.
<9>	Masawe alisema watu wengine waliojeruhiwa kwenye vurugu hizo ni mgambo mmoja na Ofisa Mtendaji wa Kata ya Lwande.	Masawe said the other people who were hurt in that chaos are one militia and an executive officer of Lwande ward.
<10>	Na watu wanne wamekamatwa kutokana na tukio hilo na uchunguzi unaendelea.	and four people have been arrested as a result of the scene and investigation is ongoing.
<11>	Masawe alipoulizwa kama watu hao ni magaidi na walikuwa wanajifunza mbinu za kivita msituni, alikanusha jambo hilo, huku akitanabahisha kuwa itajulikana kwenye upelelezi, lakini mpaka sasa inafahamika waliofanya hivyo ni wananchi wa kawaida.	when Masawe was asked if the guys were terrorists training on guerrilla war tactics in the wild, he denounced it and said it will be determined in the investigation, but until then it is believed that whoever did this were ordinary citizens.
<12>	“Kujua kama hao walikuwa ni watu wenye imani kali ya dini ama ni magaidi itajulikana baadaye baada ya upelelezi, lakini mpaka sasa hakuna kitu kinachoonesha kama kuna kitu kama hicho,” alisema Masawe.	"whether they were religious extremists or terrorists will be known after investigation, but until then, there is nothing that shows that there is anything like that," said Masawe.
<13>	Masawe alisema huo ni mfululizo wa matukio ya askari kushambuliwa, kwani Oktoba 17, mwaka huu saa 4.30 usiku Ofisa Upelelezi wa Wilaya ya Lushoto, Frank Oforo, alishambuliwa na wananchi kwa kukatwa mapanga manne kichwani kwenye kijiji cha Viti, kata ya Shume.	Masawe said that it is a series of incidents of police being attacked since, on October 17th of this year at 10:30 at night, the investigations officer for Lushoto district Frank Oforo was attacked by residents by being hacked with machetes four times on the head in Viti village, Shume ward.
<14>	Ni baada ya yeye na wenzake kwenda kijijini hapo kwa nia ya kumkamata mtu aliyevunja amri ya kuitwa mahakamani, Mohamed Hamis kutokana na mgogoro wa mashamba.	it was after he and his colleagues went to the village with the intention of arresting a person, Mohamed Hamis, who defied a court summon in a land dispute case.
<15>	Alisema baada ya kuona anashambuliwa kwa mapanga alitoa bastola yake na kuwarushia risasi wananchi na kumuua Hamis Seif, huku Athman Abdallah akijeruhiwa na kulazwa kwenye Hospitali ya Wilaya ya Lushoto na Oforo amelazwa kwenye Hospitali ya Bombo jijini Tanga.	he said that on seeing he was being attacked with machetes he got out his pistol, and discharged bullets to citizens and killed Hamis Seif, while Athman Abdallah was injured and admitted to Lushoto district hospital and Oforo was admitted to Bombo hospital in Tanga city.
<16>	Masawe alisema katika tukio jingine Oktoba 16 muda wa jioni, askari kwenye kambi ya Maramba JKT iliyopo wilayani Mkinga Alquine Raymond, alipigwa na kuvunjwa miguu na wananchi akiwa mitaani.	Masawe said in another incident on the evening of October 16th, Alquine Raymond, a police officer in Maramba JKT camp, which is in Mkinga district, was beaten by citizens and had his legs broken while in the streets.
<17>	Ni baada ya kumalizika kwa mchezo kati ya timu ya jeshi na ile ya Raia mjini Maramba.	this was after the match between the military team and the civilian team in Maramba city.
