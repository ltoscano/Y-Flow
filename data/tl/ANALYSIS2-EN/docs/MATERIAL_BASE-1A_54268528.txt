<4>	KOCHA Mkuu wa Simba, Joseph Omog, ameshtukia safu ya benchi la ufundi la mahasimu wao, Yanga ikiwepo kuanza mapema maandalizi yao kwa ajili ya mzunguko wa pili na kuwataka wachezaji wake wote kufika kwa wakati siku ambayo wamepanga kuanza mazoezi ya kujiandaa na mzunguko wa pili wa Ligi Kuu ya Tanzania Bara.	the new Simba head coach, Joseph Omog, has been surprised by their rival team Yanga's team of technical staff, and started their preparations early for the second round, requiring all his players to arrive on time on the planned date for the commencement of training to prepare for the second round of the Tanzania Mainland Premier League.
<5>	Juzi Ijumaa Yanga, ilitangaza benchi jipya la Ufundi ambalo litakuwa chini ya kocha Mzambia George Lwandamina huku aliyekuwa kocha mkuu wa timu hiyo, Mholanzi Hans Pluijm akipandishwa cheo na kuwa Mkurugenzi wa Ufundi wa klabu hiyo.	on Friday, Yanga announced a new technical bench that will be under the guidance of Zambian coach, George Lwandamina, while the former head coach of the team, Dutchman Hans Pluijm, was promoted to the position of technical director of the club.
<6>	Akizungumza na gazeti hili Omog, alikiri kuwa mikakati ya wapinzani wao Yanga imemtia hofu na kutoa mwito kwa wachezaji wake popote walipo kufika kwa wakati ili kuanza maandalizi yao ya mzunguko wa pili wakiwa wote na kupeana mbinu mbadala, ambazo zitaweza kuwasaidia kuwapa ubingwa msimu huu.	speaking to this newspaper, Omog confessed that the strategies of their opponents, the  Yanga team, has made him panic and he urged his players, wherever they are, to arrive on time to commence their preparation for the second round as a full team, and he gave an alternative strategy that will help them become champions this season.
<7>	“Lazima nikiri kuwa Yanga ndiyo timu ambayo inanipa presha kwa sababu tunatofautiana nao kwa pointi mbili, lakini kitendo cha kubadilisha benchi lao la ufundi nacho kinaonesha namna walivyokuwa makini katika kuendelea kuwa tena mabingwa msimu huu kutokana na ubora wa kocha na Mkurugenzi wa ufundi,” alisema Omog.	"I must confess that Yanga is the team that gives me pressure because we are two points apart, but the act of changing their technical bench shows how keen they are to continue being champions again this season, due to the quality of their coach and their technical director," said Omog.
<8>	Kocha huyo alisema ingawa hafahamiani vizuri na Lwandamina, lakini anaonesha ni kocha mwenye uwezo mkubwa, kutokana na mafanikio aliyoipa Zesco United, sawa na Pluijm ambaye amepewa cheo cha Ukurugenzi hivyo anaamini Yanga ya mzunguko wa pili itawasumbua zaidi kutokana na uwepo wao.	the coach said that despite not knowing Lwandamina well, he demonstrates that he is a coach with great abilities, following the his successes with the Zesco United team, like Pluijm, who has been given the position of director, so he believes that in the second round, Yanga cause them more trouble because of their presence.
<9>	Alisema anataka kuanza maandalizi mapema, lengo likiwa ni kurudisha umoja na ufiti wa wachezaji wake pamoja na kuwajenga kisaikolojia kwa sababu watakuwa wakicheza kwa presha kutokana na tofauti ya pointi mbili kati yao na mahasimu wao Yanga.	he said that he wants to start preparations early, with the aim to restore teamwork and the fitness of his players, as well as to prepare them psychologically, because they will be playing under pressure, due to the two point difference between them and their rivals Yanga.
<10>	“Tutacheza kwa presha kubwa kwa sababu ya tofauti ya pointi mbili hofu yetu ni kuhofia kupoteza mchezo kwamba wapinzani wetu watatupita na kibaya zaidi tuna mechi nyingi za ugenini mzunguko wa pili", alisema na kuongeza:	"we are playing under great pressure because of the two points' difference. our concern is losing a match, our opponents will get ahead of us, and worse still, we have many away matches in the second round," he said and added,
<11>	“Endapo tutaanza maandalizi kwa pamoja niwazi tutaweza kurudisha ari ya waliyokuwa nayo wachezaji wetu na kuweza kupambana na Yanga kwenye mbio za ubingwa,” alisema Omog.	"if we start preparation together, it is clear we will restore the morale our players had and be able to cope with Yanga in the title race," said Omog
<12>	Simba imepoteza michezo miwili sawa na Yanga kwenye mzunguko wa kwanza na tofauti yao ni pointi mbili na kocha Omog, amepania timu hiyo kutwaa ubingwa wa Ligi Kuu msimu huu na ndiyo maana amewasisitiza wachezaji wake kujitokeza kwa wingi siku ya kwanza ya mazoezi ya timu hiyo.	Simba have lost two matches like Yanga in the first round and their difference is two points. coach Omog is determined that the team will win the Premier League title this season and that is why he has urged his players to come out in large numbers on the team's first day of training.
<13>	Wakati huo huo, Omog amewataka viongozi wa klabu hiyo kusajili wachezaji watatu tu, ambao ni kipa, beki na mshambuliaji.	at the same time, Omog has urged the leaders of the club to sign only three players: a goalkeeper, a defender and a striker.
