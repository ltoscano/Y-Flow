<1>	Tunaipongeza Tume ya Utumishi wa Mahakama Imeandikwa na Mhariri Imechapishwa: 09 Septemba 2016	we congratulate the Judicial Service Commission. written by the editor, published: 09 September 2016
<2>	MHIMILI wa dola wa Mahakama unaogopwa na kuheshimiwa na jamii.	the Head of the Judiciary Authority is feared and respected by the community.
<3>	Lakini katika siku za karibuni, baadhi ya wananchi wamepunguza imani kwa mhimili huo kwa kiasi fulani kutokana na majaji na mahakimu, kuonekana kama sehemu ya kupindisha haki za Watanzania, hasa wanyonge.	but in recent days, some citizens have reduced their faith in the Head of the Judiciary Authority to some extent as a result of judges and magistrates being seen to bend the rights of Tanzanians, especially those of the poor.
<4>	Watendaji hao ambao kwa kawaida wanategemewa mno na wananchi katika kutetea haki zao, baadhi yao wanaongoza katika kukandamiza wananchi kwa kudai rushwa ili kuwapa ushindi wasiostahili au kurahisisha utekelezaji wa dhuluma.	some of these executives, on whom citizens normally depend so much to defend their rights, are leading the way in oppressing citizens by demanding bribes to let them win a case they don't deserve or by making the implementation of injustice easier.
<5>	Pia baadhi ya watu hao, nidhamu yao imeshuka mbele ya watuhumiwa wenye kesi mahakamani na mitaani.	also, some of these people have reduced suspects' sentences in the courts and in the neighborhood.
<6>	Kutokana na tabia hizo chafu za baadhi ya wasimamizi hao wa sheria, Tume ya Mahakama imechukua hatua kadhaa, ambazo zimetangazwa na Jaji Mkuu, Mohamed Chande Othman, aliyesema kuwa watumishi 34 wa Mahakama, wakiwemo mahakimu 11 wamefukuzwa kazi kutokana na makosa mbalimbali ya kinidhamu.	as a result of this dirty behavior, some of the managers of the law, and the Commission of the Judiciary have taken several steps, announced Chief Justice Mohamed Chande Othman, who said that 34 court workers, including 11 magistrates, have been sacked because of different disciplinary misconducts.
<7>	Sisi tunapongeza hatua hiyo na tunaamini kuwa adhabu hiyo waliyopewa, itasaidia kuirejesha idara hiyo muhimu kwenye mstari wake na watumishi wake watatambua kuwa hawapo kisiwani, bali wanafuatiliwa hivyo wasithubutu kwenda kinyume na maadili ya kazi yao.	we congratulate them on this step and we believe that the punishment they were given will help to put this important department back in line, and that its workers will recognize that they aren't on an island, and should instead stay on this path and not go against the ethics of their work.
<8>	Mathalani, katika maelezo yake, Jaji Mkuu alisema kuna hakimu alithubutu kutumia mhuri wa Mahakama ili kumfanya mfungwa, aliyehukumiwa kwenda jela miaka mitatu, aweze kukwepa adhabu hiyo.	for example, in his explanation, the Chief Justice said there was one magistrate who tried to use the court's seal in order to make a prisoner, who was sentenced to prison for three years, able to avoid that punishment.
<9>	Bila shaka, hali hii inaonesha kuwa nidhamu ya mahakimu imeondoka kabisa.	undoubtedly, this situation shows that the discipline of magistrates has completely gone.
<10>	Hivyo, ni dhahiri kuwa kuwachukuliwa hatua kali, ikiwemo za kuwafukuza kazi mahakimu 11; pamoja na Tume ya Utumishi wa Mahakama, kuendelea kujadili hatma ya mahakimu wengine 30, walioshinda kesi zao za rushwa, itawakumbusha wale waliojisahau, kuwa serikali ipo na kamwe haikubali wananchi kuendelea kunyanyasika kwenye kupata haki zao mahakamani.	in this way, it's clear that taking stern action against them, including sacking 11 magistrates, as well as the Commission of Judiciary continuing to discuss the fate of the 30 other magistrates, who won their bribery cases, will remind those who forgot themselves that the government is present and that it will never allow citizens to continue being denied their rights in the courts.
<11>	Kitendo hicho kwa kiwango fulani, kitarudisha imani ya wananchi hasa wanyonge, walioanza kuona hawana sehemu ya kupata haki, wakiamini hata mahakamani hawawezi kupata haki hiyo.	this action at a certain level will return the faith of the citizens, especially the poor, who had begun to see that they had no place to get justice, believing that even in the courts they couldn't get justice.
<12>	Sisi tunataka hatua hiyo isiwe zimamoto, bali iwe endelevu na isiishie kuwafukuza kazi au kuwapa adhabu mahakimu wakazi wafawidhi wa Mahakama za Mwanzo, kama ilivyofanyika kwa kufukuza mahakimu wa mahakama za mwanzo za Bahi, Chamwino, Rombo na Temeke.	we don't want this step to come when it's too late. instead, it should be sustainable and it shouldn't end with sacking or punishing the presiding resident magistrates of the first courts, as happened when the magistrates of the first courts of Bahi, Chamwino, Rombo and Temeke were sacked. 
<13>	Bali, tunaomba watumishi wengine ‘mapapa’, ambao inaaminika nao wanajihusisha na rushwa na vitendo vingine visivyo vya nidhamu, wachukuliwe hatua kali.	instead, we ask that stern action be taken against other worker 'sharks', who are believed to also be involved in bribery and other undisciplined actions.
<14>	Tunasema hili kwa kwa sababu imezoeleka kwenye jamii kuona ‘vidagaa’ ndivyo vinachukuliwa hatua, lakini ‘mapapa’ wanaachwa kwa kisingizio cha kukosekana ushahidi.	we say this because it has become a habit in the community to see action taken against the 'small fish', leaving the 'sharks' out, under the pretense of a lack of evidence.
<15>	Sisi tunaamini ‘mapapa’ ndiyo hula rushwa kubwa na zenye athari kwa watu wengi.	we believe the 'sharks' take big bribes that affect many people.
<16>	Kama tulivyosema awali, maamuzi hayo ya tume hiyo yanatia matumaini na kurejesha imani ya Watanzania.	like we said earlier, these decisions of the commission returned the hope and faith of Tanzanians.
<17>	Hivyo, tunaipongeza Tume ya Utumishi wa Mahakama na tunaiomba iendelee na kazi hii ya kuwachukulia hatua kali watumishi wa Mahakama, wanaofanya makosa ya kinidhamu.	therefore, we congratulate the judicial service commission and ask it to continue with this work of taking stern action against judicial workers who commit disciplinary offenses.
<18>	Hilo likifanyika, Tanzania itakuwa miongoni mwa nchi duniani, ambazo mahakama zake zinaheshimika na hakutakuwa na watu wa kupitisha chembe ya rushwa.	if that happens, Tanzania will be among countries in the world whose courts are respected, and there will be no individuals who will accept any form of bribe.
<19>	Tunahimiza wananchi waache kulalamika chinichini kuwa rushwa imejaa mahakamani, bali watoe ushirikiano kwa kutoa taarifa na kufichua watumishi wote wa Mahakama, wanaofanya vitendo vinavyokwenda kinyume na maadili ya kazi yao, ikiwemo kula rushwa.	we encourage citizens to stop complaining privately that bribery is rife in the courts. instead, they should collaborate and give information to reveal all the judicial workers who perform acts that go against their work ethics, including taking bribes.
