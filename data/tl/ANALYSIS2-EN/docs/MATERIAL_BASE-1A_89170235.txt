<2>	Kwa miaka mingi mji wa Bagamoyo uliopo mkoa wa Pwani umeonekana kuwa nyuma na wengi wakidai kuwa huo ni mji wa kihistoria hivyo ni vyema ukiwa katika mwonekano wa kihistoria ili kuwavutia watalii zaidi kutoka nje ya nchi.	for many years, Bagamoyo Town, which is in the Coast Province, has appeared to be behind the times, with many claiming that it is a historical town and therefore it would be good for it to have a historical appearance so as to attract more tourists from outside the country.
<3>	Lakini kwa sasa jambo hilo limepitwa na Bagamoyo inaanza kuwa katika mwonekano wa kuvutia na katika kuendeleza jambo hilo, kwa mara ya kwanza katika historia ya mji huo, Bagamoyo imepata saluni iliyo na hadhi kwa kutoa huduma nyingi na bora (barbershop) ambayo imepewa jina la Middle Star.	but now that idea is outdated, and Bagamoyo is beginning to have an attractive outlook, and in the name of advancing this purpose, for the first time in the history of the town, Bagamoyo has a salon with a reputation of offering various better services (a barbershop) which has been given the name Middle Star.
<4>	Mgeni rasmi katika uzinduzi huo alikuwa ni kaka wa Rais wa Tanzania wa awamu ya nne, Yusuph Kikwete ambaye pamoja na kufanya uzinduzi huo pia aliupongeza uongozi wa barbershop ya Middle Star kwa kufanya mji wa Bagamoyo kuwa na mwonekano wa kisasa kwa kupata saluni yenye hadhi kubwa.	the official guest at the launch was the brother of the Tanzanian President of the fourth term, Yusuph Kikwete, who, together with running the launch, also congratulated the leadership of Middle Star Barbershop for giving Bagamoyo Town a modern appearance by opening a salon with a big reputation.

"we had never before received these services here in Bagamoyo, unless you went to Dar to get them, therefore I should congratulate you very much for this. I believe from now on even the head of the district will be coming here, because I have personally received these services and I have seen how good they are," said Kikwete.
<7>	Kwa upande wa Mkuu wa Idara ya Habari na Masoko wa Middle Star, James Mbuligwe alisema pamoja na uwekezaji ambao wameufanya sasa, bado wamejipanga kuboresha huduma wanazozitoa ili kuifanya saloni hiyo kuwa na hadhi kubwa zaidi jambo ambalo litawezesha hata wageni wa kitaifa wanaofika wilayani hapo kushawishika kutumia saluni hiyo.
