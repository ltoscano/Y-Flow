<8>	Akitupilia mbali shauri hilo leo Kakusulo Sambo, Jaji wa Mahakama Kuu, Kanda ya Sumbawanga amesema kuwa, amefikia hatua hiyo baada ya upande wa mpeleka maombi kuiomba mahakama kuifunga kesi hiyo.	withdrawing the matter today Kakusulo Sambo, the high court judge for Sumbawanga has said he has reached that step after the complainants side requested the court to close the case.
<9>	Amesema upande wa mpeleka maombi, ulidai kwamba kutokana na ombi lao la kupokelewa kwa fomu namba 21B kukataliwa kortini hapo, ulidai hakuna umuhimu wa kuendelea kwa kesi hiyo.	he has said that the complainant's side claimed that after their request to have form number 21B received was declined by the court claimed that there is no importance of proceeding with the case.
<10>	Jaji Sambo amesema, upande wa mpeleka maombi, licha ya kupewa muda wa siku 10 kupeleka fomu namba 21B lakini hawakufanya hivyo.	Judge Sambo has said despite the complainant's side being given a 10 day period to take the form number 21B, they did not do so.
<11>	Amesema, pamoja na kuchelewa kupeleka fomu hiyo pia walipopewa muda wa kujieleza katika ombi lao la kuiomba mahakama kupokea fomu hizo, hawakueleza sababu za msingi.	he has said, together with being late in taking back that form, they were also given time to explain themselves in their request to the court to receive those forms, they did not explain the basic reasons.
<12>	Hata hivyo amesema baada ya kuwasilishwa kwa ombi hilo kortini, mahakama ilikaa na kutafakari kwa kina juu ya ombi hilo ambapo imeamua kutupilia mbali kesi hiyo.	even so, he has said that after the presentation of that request in court, the court sat and considered the request deeply whereby it has decided to throw out that case.
<13>	“Mleta maombi aliomba kufunga kesi mahakamani na mahakama sasa imepitia ombi lao, hivyo na kuona kesi hii haina msingi wowote ule na tunakubaliana nao,” amesema Jaji Sambo.	"the complainant requested to close the case in court and the court has gone through the request and therefore seen that the case does not have any basis and we agree with them," said Judge Sambo.
