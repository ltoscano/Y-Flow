<1>	HUYU NDIYE ANTONY LUSEKELO (MZEE WA UPAKO)NILIYEMFUNDISHA KARATE 'GOJU RYU' 1980's	this is Antony Lusekelo (an anointed old man) whom I taught Karate 'Gojuryu' in 1980's.

<3>	Kundi la vijana wapatao 12 hadi 20 wenye umri kati ya miaka 12 hadi 18 walikuwa wanahudhuria mafunzo ya Karate mtindo wa Go Ju Ryu yenye asili yake katika Kisiwa cha Okinawa nchini Japan.	a group of about 12 to 20 youths who are between 12 and 18 years old had been attending the karate teachings of Go Ju Ryu style whose origin is from the Okinawa Island in Japan.
<4>	Mafunzo haya ya Karate yaliyokuwa chini ya Dojo la Sempai Haruna yalikuwa yakifanyika kila siku katika Ukumbi wa Olofea( Wallfare) mjini Iringa hii ilikuwa ni miaka 35 iliyopita.	these Karate lessons that were under the Dojo of Sempai Haruna were taking place every day at the Olofea Hall (Wallfare) in Iringa City. this was 35 years ago.
<5>	Kila siku Sempai Haruna(Said Kassim Haruna) alikuwa akiwafundisha vijana wale upole na kutolipiza kisasi kutokana na aina ya mafunzo hayo kuwa yalikuwa ni mafunzi ya hatari ambayo ni silaha pekee ya mauaji inayopaswa kutumiwa kwa uangalifu mkubwa.	every day Sempai Haruna (Said Kassim Haruna) used to teach the youths gentleness and not using revenge as a result of those type of lessons being dangerous lessons which are the only murder weapon meant to be used with great carefulness.
<6>	Sempai Haruna ambaye kwa wakati huo alikuwa na Mkanda wa Brown akiutafuta mkanda mweusi baada ya kupitia mkanda wa Kijani na Mweupe alikuwa ni mahiri kwa mafunzo na alimudu vyema kuwa treat vijana wake ambao kwa wakati ule walikuwa wamejenga heshima kubwa ya mafunzo wakihudhuria kwa wingi katika Dojo ambalo lilipewa jina maarufu ‘Hekalu la Kujilinda’.	Sempai Haruna, who at the time had a brown belt and was looking for the black belt after going past the green and white belts, was skillful in the lessons and managed well to treat his youths, who at the time had built great respect for the lessons, and attending in masses at the Dojo which had been given a name famous as 'the temple of self protection'.
<7>	Katika siku za mwanzo kundi kubwa la vijana lilihudhuria mafunzo, nadhani hii ilitokana na hamasa ya miaka ile ya vijana kupenda kujifunza Sanaa ya Mapigano kutokana na ujio wa filamu za Kung Fu na Karate.	during the initial days, a big group of youths attended the lessons, I think this was from the zeal of the youths' interest to learn the art of fighting as a result of the presence of Kung Fu and Karate films.
<8>	Baadhi walihamasika ili wajifananishe na Bruce Lee Mchina aliyetokea kuwa mahiri kwa kucheza Kung Fu ama Sonn Chiba Mjapani kutokea Kisiwa cha Okinawa nchini Japan aliyekuwa mahiri katika mapigano hasa kwa mchezo wa Karate ya mtindo wa Go Ju Ryu( Ngumu Na Laini).	some were inspired to imitate Bruce Lee, the Chinese actor who rose skillfully to play Kung Fu and Sonn Chiba, the Japanese from Okinawa Island from Japan who was skillful in fighting especially in the game of Karate the Go Ju Ryu style (tough and smooth).
<9>	Kadri siku zilivyoyoma ndivyo ambavyo kundi lilianza kuwa na wanafunzi wachache, lilipungua wanafunzi aidha kutokana na aina ya mafunzo na mazoezi yalivyokuwa magumu ama ni kutokana na namna ya mapokeo ya wanafunzi hao waliodhani kwamba mafunzo hayo yatawatuma kuingia mitaani na kupiga watu na kujionesha umahiri wa kupiga mateke na KATA.	as days went by that is how the group started having fewer students. the students reduced either from the type of lessons and how exercises hardened or it was from the type of reception some students received who thought that the lessons would send them to go into the streets to beat people up and showcase their skills of throwing kicks and blows.
<10>	‘’Maegel, Ushiro Gel,Jodan Zuki, Gedan Zuki Chudan Zuki’’ ni aina ya mateke na aina ya ngumi zilizokuwa zikitumika wakati wa mafunzo ambayo kila siku ya DOJO hasa kwa wale vijana wa awali kuingia walilazimika kucheza ngumi hizo na kupiga mateke aina hiyo hadi mwisho wa mafunzo wakati wale waliotangulia wakiwa katika KATA zingine kama vile Sanden Uke Bara ink.	"Maegel, Ushiro Gel, Jodan Zuki, Gedan Zuki Chudan Zuki" are types of kicks and blows which were being used during the lessons whereby each day to go into the Dojo, especially for the former youths, they were forced to play those types of blows and kicks until the end of lessons, while the preceding ones were in other sections like Sanden Uke Bara ink.
<11>	Nimetanguliza muhtasari wa maelezo hayo ili nieleweke vyema maudhui yangu nikijinasibisha mimi mwenyewe mwandishi wa stori hii na kijana mdogo mwembamba mwenye kamwili kadogo wakati ule ambaye tulizoea kumuita jina la SEKELO.	I have prioritized the summary of these explanations so that I can be understood well on my subject attributing myself, the writer of this story and a young slender man, with a small body who at the time we got used to referring to by the name Sekelo.
<12>	Sekelo alikuwa ni kati ya vijana waliojiunga na DOJO la SEMPAI Haruna kwa mhemko akitaka ajue mambo mengi kwa wakati mmoja, bahati mbaya Sempai Haruna alikuwa akitoa mafunzo ngazi kwa ngazi ili wanafunzi wake tuelewe vyema Sanaa ya Mapigano.	Sekelo was part of the youths who joined the Dojo of Sempai Haruna with excitement in need to know about many things at the same time. unluckily, Sempai Haruna was giving the lessons grade by grade so that we his students could understand the art of fighting well.
<13>	SEKELO alikuwa ni kati ya vijana wa mwanzo kuingia mitini kutoroka DOJO kati ya kundi la vijana wengi waliojiunga na kutaka siku ya kwanza tu aweze kurusha mateke ya Ushiro Gel kabla hata hajajua kupiga teke la MAEGEL, teke la Ushiro lilikuwa ni la kuzunguka na Maegel lilikuwa ni teke la kawaida la kupiga mbele.	Sekelo was among the first students to go into the woods and disappear from the Dojo among the group of many youths who had joined and wanted to be able to throw the "Ushiro Gel" kicks on just the first day even before knowing how to through the "Maegel" kicks. the "Ushiro" kick was a circular one and the "Maegel" one was a normal forward kick.
<14>	Na ili uweze kupiga teke la USHIRO ulipaswa kuwa Flexible kutokana na mazoezi ya muda mrefu unayohudhuria ikiwemo mazoezi ya viungo na Push Up, mazoezi ambayo mara nyingi SEKELO alikuwa akiyakacha.	to be able to throw the "Ushiro" kick, you were required to be flexible from exercises that you completed over a long period of time, including body exercises and push ups. exercises which many times Sekelo would skip.
<15>	Kundi kubwa la vijana walikimbia, hadi tukabaki vijana wachache na hatimaye tukabaki wanafunzi wawili, mimi Rashid Mkwinda na mwenzangu Abbas Upete, tulivumilia na mafunzo yetu na kufikia hatua kubwa tukauacha mkanda mweupe, tukaingia mkanda wa KIJANI na baadaye tukaupata mkanda wa BROWN wakati huo Sempai wetu akiwa ameukwaa mkanda mweusi, tuliacha kumuita SEMPAI tukajikuta tukimuita SENSEI ingawa yeye mwenyewe hakupenda kuitwa SENSEI.	a huge group of youths ran away until only a few of us remained and in the end two of us remained. I, Rashid Mkwinda, and my colleague Abbas Upete. we endured our lessons and attained the big step, we got the white belt and achieved the green belt and later on we got the brown belt at the time our Sempai had acquired the black belt. we stopped calling him Sempai and found ourselves calling him Sensei even though he personally didn't like being called Sensei.
<16>	SEKELO ambaye kwa sasa asilimia kubwa ya Watanzania wanamuita MZEE WA UPAKO tulikuwa tukimuita hivyo kwa jina kifupi cha jina la LUSEKELO, wakati ule sikulijua jina la ANTONY tulizoea kumuita hivyo SEKELO.	we used to call him Sekelo, a short form of the name Lusekelo, which a huge percent of Tanzanians call the old man of anointing. at the time I didn't know the name Antony, as we were used to calling him Sekelo.
<17>	Mimi na mwenzangu Abbas Upete tulipata kazi kubwa sana ya kumfundisha SEKELO kwa kuwa tuliwa ni kati ya vijana wakubwa katika DOJO lile na hawa akina SEKELO wakiwa ni vijana wadogo wadogo waliokuwa wakija kwenye HEKALU LA KUJILINDA mara moja moja na siku ambayo alitokeza SEMPAI Haruna hakuacha kumpa adhabu ya kupiga Push Up.	I and my colleague Abbas Upete got a very big job to teach Sekelo because we were among the bigger youths at that Dojo and Sekelo and the likes being the younger youths who were coming to the temple of self protection once in a while, and the day he appeared, Sempai Haruna never stopped giving him the punishment of doing push ups.
<18>	Wakati ule SEKELO nilikuwa namuona kama kijana mbishi na mwenye pupa aliyetaka kujua mengi kwa wakati mmoja bila kupitia ngazi zingine, pia nilimuona ni kijana mwenye hamaki ni kama alijiunga katika DOJO kwa ajili ya KULIPIZA KISASI kwa vijana wenzie waliokuwa wakimuonea shuleni kwao pale WILOLESI ambao mara kadhaa walimtwanga MAKONZI, nilimuona SEKELO kama mtu wa visasi.	at the time I used to see Sekelo as an argumentative and eager youth who wanted to know much without going through other levels. I also saw him as a youth with a temper, so it's like he had joined the Dojo for the purpose of getting revenge on his fellow youths who were picking on him in their school in Wilolesi, who beat him many times. I saw Sekelo as a vengeful person.
<19>	Wakati huo DOJO likiwa limebaki na wanafunzi watatu pamoja na mwenzetu mmoja mwanafunzi aliyekuwa akisoma Highland Secondary( mwenzangu Abbas Upete atakuwa anamkumbuka vyema), SEKELO alikuwa akija mara moja moja kuchungulia kuona hatua tuliyofikia hata baada ya kuhama kufanyia mazoezi OLOFEA hadi shule ya Msingi AZIMIO vijana wengi walikuwa wakija kusimama na kuchungulia dirishani akiwemo SEKELO.	at the time, the Dojo had remained with three students, together with our fellow student who was studying at Highland Secondary (my colleague Abbas Upete will remember him well). Sekelo used to come once in a while to peep and see the level we had attained even after moving from training at Olofea to Azimio Primary School. many youths used to come to stand and peep through the window, including Sekelo.
<20>	Nilipotezana na SEKELO miaka ile ya mwanzoni mwa themanini hadi miaka ya hivi karibuni ANTONY LUSEKELO(MZEE WA UPAKO) alipoanza mahubiri, nilijiuliza maswali mengi, bali niliamini kwamba ni kitambo kirefu tumeachana inawezekana SEKELO amebadilika tabia na kwa vile anamtumikia Mungu huenda kwa sasa ameongoka na amekuwa mtumishi wa kweli wa wanaKONDOO waliopotea wanaohitaji uongofu.	I lost contact with Sekelo during the early eighties until the recent years when Antony Lusekelo (the anointed old man) started preaching, I asked myself many questions, but I believed that it had been a long time since we parted and it is possible that Sekelo changed his  behavior and because he is serving God perhaps he is now reformed and become a true servant of the lost sheep in need of conversion.
<21>	Leo Napata picha halisi ya ANTONY LUSEKELO niliyemjua tangu miaka ya themanini akiwa kijana mdogo tukimfundisha kupiga ngumi na mateke na baadaye kuamua kuingia mitini huenda ni baada ya kuona makusudio yake ya kujifunza KARATE ili akalipize kisasi kwa waliomtandika KONZI shuleni hayakutimia.	today I'm getting the original picture of Antony Lusekelo whom I knew since the eighties as a young boy while we teaching him how to throw punches and kicks and later on deciding to go missing, perhaps it was from seeing that his expectations of learning karate to revenge to those who beat him in school did not succeed.
