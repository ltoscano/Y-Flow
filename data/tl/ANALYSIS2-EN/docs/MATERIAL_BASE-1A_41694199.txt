<3>	SAKATA la madai ya kuwapo kwa jaribio la utapeli dhidi ya Mbunge wa Viti maalumu, Leticia Nyerere kutoka kwa mkazi wa Dar es Salaam, Fauzia Jamal Mohamed, ambaye gazeti hili linamwomba radhi kutokana na habari yake iliyochapishwa katika toleo namba 314 (yenye kichwa cha habari Mbunge anusurika utapeli wa milioni 300), limeingia katika sura mpya baada ya Fauzia kuwasilisha malalamiko yake kwa Mkuu wa Jeshi la Polisi nchini (IGP), Saidi Mwema.	an attempt at a corruption allegation scandal is on the horizon against special seat's parliamentarian, Leticia Nyerere, from a resident of Dar es Salaam, Fauzia Jamal Mohamed, whom this newspaper seeks an apology for the story that was published in edition number 314 (with the headline of the story being a parliamentarian survives being conned 300 million), and has taken a new twist after Fauzia presented her complaints to the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Saidi Mwema.
<4>	Katika toleo la gazeti hilo namba 314, iliripotiwa kuhusu jaribio la Fauzia kutaka kumtapeli Mbunge wa Viti maalumu, Leticia Nyerere, Sh. milioni 315 kupitia kwa mshirika wake kibiashara, Lilian Kileo, katika makubaliano ya kuuziana nyumba ya serikali iliyoko eneo la Oysterbay, jijini Dar es Salaam.	in the newspaper release number 314, it was reported that Fauzia's attempt to defraud special seat member of parliament, Leticia Nyerere, 315 million shillings through her business partner, Lilian Kileo, in their agreement to purchase the government house in Oysterbay area, in Dar es Salaam.
<5>	Pia katika habari hiyo, pamoja na mambo mengine iliripotiwa kwamba baada ya Fauzia kushindwa kutimiza ahadi yake hiyo ya kutaka kuuza nyumba, Lilian alifungua kesi Kituo Kikuu cha Polisi Kinondoni jijini Dar es Salaam na kufanikisha kukamatwa kwa Fauzia na kufunguliwa jalada la upelelezi kituoni hapo.	also in that report, along with the other things reported, after Fauzia failed to fulfill her promise of selling the house, Lilian opened a case at the central police in Kinondoni, Dar es Salaam and ensured Fauzia was arrested and an investigation opened at the station.
<6>	Ingawa suala hilo linaendelezwa katika mkondo wa kisheria baina ya wahusika, kwa upande gazeti la Raia Mwema, tunaheshimu makubaliano ya kisheria kati yetu na Fauzia na kwa hiyo, tunaomba radhi kwa usumbufu wowote uliojitokeza, uliotokana na habari hiyo kumhusisha Fauzia na utapeli.	although the matter is being investigated on legal grounds between the concerned parties, on the side of Raia Mwema newspaper, we respect the legal agreement between us and Fauzia and therefore we apologize for any inconveniences that emerged from that report associating Fauzia with fraud.
<7>	Kwa kuzingatia nyaraka za ziada ambazo ametupatia Fauzia, tunaamini katika suala hilo mahsusi yeye si tapeli bali walikopeshana fedha na Lilian Onael Kileo, kwa mujibu wa mkataba wa mkopo wa Januari 30, 2013.	by considering the additional documents that Fauzia gave to us, we believe, particularly for this issue, that she is not a fraudster but loaned money with Lilian Onael Kileo, in accordance with the loan agreement of January 30, 2013.
<8>	Hata hivyo, katika hatua nyingine Fauzia ameripoti malalamiko yake kwa IGP Saidi Mwema.	however, in another scenario, Fauzia has reported her complaints to the IGP, Said Mwema.
<9>	Kwa mujibu wa barua ya Fauzia ya Agosti 31, mwaka huu kwenda Tume ya Malalamiko, Polisi Makao Makuu, iliyopokelewa katika ofisi hiyo Septemba 2, mwaka huu, Fauzia anailalamikia ofisi ya mkuu wa upelelezi mkoa wa kipolisi wa Kinondoni kutokana na kitendo cha kumkamata nyumbani kwake Agosti 23, mwaka huu kwa njia ya kumdhalilisha.	according to Fauzia's letter on August 31 this year to the complaints commission, Police Headquarters, and brought to the office on September 2 this year, Fauzia complained to the office head of investigations in the provinces of Kipolisi and Kinondoni, following the arrest at her home in a disgraceful manner on August 23, this year.
<10>	“Askari mmoja aliyejitambulisha kwa jina (linatajwa) ndiye aliyeniweka chini ya ulinzi na kuninyang’anya simu zangu mbili na kumpatia askari wa kike…wakati wananikamata hawakunieleza kosa langu, mlalamikaji dhidi yangu wala namba ya kesi ninayotuhumiwa nayo,” anaeleza Fauzia katika barua yake ya malalamiko ambayo inafafanua kwamba alishikiliwa Kituo cha Polisi kwa siku moja bila kufuatwa utaratibu.	"one policeman who introduced himself by name (mentioned) is the one who kept me under police custody, took away my two phones and gave them to a female police... when arresting me, I wasn't informed of my mistake, my complainant or the case number that I was charged against," says Fauzia in her complaint letter which explains that she was held at the police station for one day without proper procedures being followed.
<11>	“Naomba shauri langu lichunguzwe kwa umakini kwa sheria stahili.	"I am asking that my advice is examined with attention by the deserving officials".
<12>	Nikiwa mzalendo wa Tanzania, tukio hili limenisikitisha, limenihuzunisha na kunidharaulisha sana ikizingatiwa kuwa mimi ni mama wa miaka 73, mwenye kuheshimika katika jamii inayonizunguka,” anaeleza Fauzia.	as a Tanzanian citizen, this incident has aggrieved, saddened and disgraced me so much, considering that I am a 73-year old mother who is respectable in the society around me," explains Fauzia.
<13>	Malalamiko hayo ya Fauzia yameibua agizo kutoka ofisi ya IGP kwenda kwa Mkurugenzi wa Upelelezi wa Makosa ya Jinai.	those complaints by Fauzia have stirred orders from the office of IGP to the director of criminal investigations.
<14>	Agizo hilo ndani ya barua yenye kumbukumbu namba C13/900/C/VOL1/13 ya Septemba 9, mwaka huu, linasema: “Inspekta Jenerali wa Polisi ameagiza ufanye uchunguzi ili kupata ukweli wake.”	the order in the letter with reference number C13/900/C/VOL1/13 for September 9 this year, says: "Inspector General of Police has ordered you to do an investigation to find out its truth."
<15>	Ukweli unaoagizwa kutafutwa na IGP ni kuhusu malalamiko hayo ya Fauzia kwamba alikamatwa na kutotendewa haki na Mkuu wa Upelelezi Mkoa wa Kipolisi wa Kinondoni.	the truth being asked to be investigated by IGP is for the complaints by Fauzia of being arrested and treated unfairly by the head of investigation of the Kipolisi and Kinondoni provinces.
