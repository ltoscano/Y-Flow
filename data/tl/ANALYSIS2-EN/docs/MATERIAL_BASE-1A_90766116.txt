<2>	HAKUNA swali linaloulizwa na wengi kama ni aina gani ya biashara ambayo mtu anaweza kufanya ili kufanikiwa na kupata kipato.	there is no question being asked by many people quite like what kind of business can a person take to succeed and earn money.
<3>	Nimekuwa nikisikia maswali mengi na majibu yake hata mimi nashindwa kupata kutokana na kutokuwa mzoefu na biashara.	I have heard many questions and have equally failed in getting answers as a result of lack of experience in business.
<4>	Hata hivyo, si kwamba mtu akisomea mambo ya biashara ndio anakuwa na uelewa zaidi kuliko ambaye hajasomea, la hasha!	however, it is not that, when a person has studied business, they acquire a better understanding than one who hasn't studied, not at all!
<5>	Bali kuna baadhi ya watu huwa na uzoefu au uelewa wa mambo ingawa hawajayasomea darasani.	there are a couple of individuals who have experience or understanding of concepts even though they have not been taught in class.
<6>	Hivi karibuni nimekuwa nikipata maswali mbalimbali kuhusu kama mfanyabiashara anatakiwa kujua kwanza ni aina gani ya biashara ambayo anaweza kuifanya na ikamuingizia faida.	recently, I have been receiving a number of questions about whether a businessperson is expected to first know what kind of business he can venture into to get profit from it.
<7>	Lakini kuna watu au wafanyabiashara wa karne hii ambao kwa asilimia kubwa wamekuwa tofauti zaidi katika uchaguzi na kupanga mipango juu ya biashara gani inafaa kufanya kwa wakati huo.	but there are people or businesspersons in this century of which a large percentage have been quite different in the selection and arrangement of plans about which business ought to be done at that time.
<8>	Kuna baadhi ya watu na haswa wafanyabiashara walio wengi huwa wanalalamika sana pindi wanapoona kuwa biashara yao inakuwa mbaya zaidi, badala ya kujua na kutafuta tatizo ni nini wanaanza kulaumu na kuanza kuwatuhumu wafanyabiashara wenzake kuwa wanamfanyia hiyana na kuziba riziki yake.	there are a couple of individuals and especially businesspersons who are the majority and often complain a lot when they see their businesses deteriorating further instead of knowing and identifying what the problem is, instead, they start blaming and accusing their fellow traders that they result in inadequacies, baring his livelihood.
<9>	Imani hizo kwa wafanyabiashara walio wengi zimetawala sana kwani wanashindwa kujua tatizo liko wapi na hatimaye wanashikana uchawi, na katika biashara nawahakikishia hakuna uchawi wala ndumba kwa wale wanaoamini.	that belief among the majority of businesspersons has largely dominated because they fail to identify where the problem is and eventually attribute it to witchcraft, but in business, I assure you, there is neither witchcraft nor black magic to those who believe.
<10>	Zipo mbinu na njia sahihi za kufanya mambo kwa mikakati bora.	there are appropriate strategies and ways of doing things in proper procedures.
<11>	Kikubwa zaidi ni kujua mbinu za biashara unayoifanya, inataka ufanye nini ili ufikie malengo unayoyatarajia kutokana na biashara unayoifanya kwa wakati huo.	the most important thing is to know the strategies of the business you are undertaking, what does it require you to do in order to attain the goals you expect from the business you are undertaking at the time?
<12>	Mara nyingi wafanyabiashara wamekuwa wakilalamika bila utafiti kwa kudai kuwa na biashara mbaya lakini ni kutokana na kutokujua tu na kukosa msingi mzuri wa biashara yako na uwezo wa kuimudu.	many a times, businesspersons complained without researching about claims of bad businesses but it is just as a result of ignorance and lacking proper foundation for your business and ability to manage it.
<13>	Ngoja nikwambie mfanyabiashara mwenzangu unajua siri kubwa ya biashara, ni kujua ni kitu gani wateja wako wanataka katika mazingira hayo na kinachoendana na wakati.	let me tell you my fellow trader, you know, the greatest secret in business is to know what your customers want in that setting and that corresponds to now.
<14>	Ingawa kila bidhaa huuzika kwa maana kwamba inategemeana ni aina gani ya mzigo na ni wa gharama gani.	although every commodity is marketable in the sense that it depends which kind of luggage it is and its cost.
