<2>	Dec 08, 2016	December 08, 2016.
<3>	WAWEKEZAJI wa nje kwenye soko la hisa la Dar es Salaam wameendelea kuadimika baada ya ripoti za soko kuonyesha kwamba hakukuwa na mwekezaji wa nje aliyeuza wala kununua katika kipindi cha wiki nne za mwezi jana isipokuwa wiki jana.	foreign investors at the Dar es Salaam stock market continue to be scarce after a market report showed that there is no foreign investor who sold or purchased in a period of four weeks and the previous month except for last week.
<4>	Ripoti zimeonyesha kwamba, kwa wiki kadhaa zilizopita wawekezaji wa ndani walilitawala soko, kwani hisa zote zilizouzwa na nyingi za kununuliwa zilikuwa ni za wawekezaji wa ndani.	reports show that for the past few weeks local investors dominated the market in all the stocks that were sold and majority of those purchased were from local investors.
<5>	Wawekezaji toka nje ya nchi walifurika kwa wingi kwenye soko mwezi Julai mpaka Septemba ambapo ripoti zinaonyesha kwamba asilimia 87 ya mauzo na manunuzi ya hisa yalitawaliwa na wao.	foreign investors dominated the market in large numbers from July to September where reports indicate that 87 percent of sales and purchases of stock were dominated by them.
<6>	Kwa wiki iliyoishia Novemba 22 mwaka huu asilimia 10 ya mauzo ya hisa ilifanywa na wawekezaji wa nje ya nchi na walichangia asilimia 10 tu ya mapato ya biashara ya hisa.	in the week ending November 22 this year, 10 percent of the sales of the shares were done by foreign investors and they contributed only 10 percent of the revenue of the trading stock.
<7>	Hata hivyo, kwa wiki iliyoishia Ijumaa, asilimia 47.06 ya mapato yaliyopatikana kutokana na ununuzi wa hisa ilitokana na wawekezaji wa ndani.	however, for the week ending Friday, 47.06 percent of the revenue obtained from the sale of shares came from the local investors.
<8>	Hata hivyo, kwa wiki nzima ya jana, hakuna mwekezaji wan je aliyeuza hisa zake kwenye soko la hisa, hali inayoonyesha kwamba bado wengi wao wana ukwasi ama mazingira ya sasa hayatoi motisha kwa wao kuuza hisa hizo.	nevertheless, for the whole of last week, there is no foreign investor who sold his shares to the stock exchange, a state that shows that a majority of them still have liquidity or the prevailing environment does not offer motivation for them to sell those shares.
<9>	Wawekezaji kutoka nje ndio wanaongoza kwa umiliki wa hisa kwenye soko la hisa la inakadiriwa kuwa ni watanzania 100,000 tu ndio wanaoshiriki kwenye biashara ya masoko ya mitaji.	foreign investors are the ones leading in the ownership of shares at the stock market and it is estimated that only 100,000 Tanzanians participate in the business of capital markets.
<10>	Eunice Kinabo, afisa wa soko la hisa (DSE) ameliambia Raia Mwema kwamba pamoja na kuadimika kwa wawekezaji wa nje, hali hii haina madhara yoyote kwenye soko.	Eunice Kinabo, officer of the stock exchange (DSE) has informed Raia Mwema that together with the scarcity of the foreign investors, this state does not have any effect on the market.
<11>	“Wakati mwingine huenda wawekezaji toka nje hawana shida ya kifedha hali ambayo ingewalazimisha kuuza hisa zao, ama wamewekeza maeneo mengine ambayo siyo ya hisa kupanua wigo wao wa uwekezaji,” alisema.	"sometimes the foreign investors probably have no financial problems, a situation that could have forced them to sell their shares or invest in other areas not related to shares to expand their scope of investment," she said.
<12>	Hali hii inaonyesha kwamba wawekezaji wengi walikimbilia kwenye hati fungani za serikali ambazo zilinunuliwa kwa ziada ya asilimia 33 wiki jana.	this state shows that many investors took refuge in government treasury bonds that were bought for more than 33 percent last week.
<13>	Hata hivyo, Kinabo alisema hawezi kujua kwa haraka sababu nyingine iliyowakimbiza wawekezaji mpaka itakapojulikana wametoka nchi ipi.	nevertheless, Kinabo said she cannot instantly know other reasons that discouraged investors until their country of origin has been identified.
<14>	“Unajua wawekezaji wengi wiki jana walikimbilia kwenye hatu fungani za serikali kwani huo ni uwekezaji ambao hauna hatari za kibisara,” alisema.	"you know many investors last week ran for government treasury bonds since that is an investment that does not have business risks," she said.
<15>	Tofauti na hisa ambazo zina hatari ya kushuka bei pale kampuni husika itakapofanya vibaya kibiashara, hati fungani ni eneo ambalo hukimbiliwa na wawekezaji kwa sababu sio rahisi serikali kushindwa kulipa.	different from shares that bear risks of depreciating in value when the concerned company performs dismally in business, treasury bond is an area that investors run to because it is not easy for the government to fail to pay.
<16>	Taarifa ya soko la hisa imeonyesha kwamba idadi ya mauzo kwa mwezi Novemba iliongezeka kwa asilimia 47 hadi kufikia shilingi bilioni 44.4 kutoka shilingi bilioni 45.7 kwa mwezi Oktoba.	stock market report shows that the volume of sales for the month of November increased by 47 percent to reach 44.4 billion shillings from 45.7 billion shillings for the month of October.
<17>	Idadi ya hisa zilizouzwa na kununuliwa kwa wiki iliyopita kwa mujibu wa Kinabo iliongezeka mara mbili hadi kufikia 262,598 kutoka hisa 101,809 kwa wiki iliyoishia Desemba 2.	the volume of shares that were sold and purchased in the previous week according to Kinabo doubled to reach 262,598 from 101,809 shares for the week ending December 2.
<18>	Hata hivyo, pamoja na kuongezeka kwa idadi ya hisa zilizofanyiwa biashara, mauzo yalishuka hadi kufikia shilingi milioni 200.	nevertheless, together with the increase in the volume of shares that were traded, purchases reduced to 200 million shillings.
<19>	Ripoti ya mauzo ya hati fungani ya miaka mitano ya Benki Kuu iliyouzwa hivi karibuni ilionyesha kwamba maombi ya kiasi cha shilingi bilioni 113 yalipokelewa na dhidi ya mahitaji ya shilingi bilioni 105.	the report on the sale of a five-year government treasury bond of the Central Bank that was sold recently demonstrated that requests amounting to 113 billion shillings were received against the demand of 105 billion shillings.
<20>	Hata hivyo, pamoja na kuwa na maombo mengi zaidi ya mahitaji, benki kuu ilikubali maombi yenye thamani ya shilingi bilioni 60.32 na kufanya bilioni zaidi ya 70 kurudishwa kwa wawekezaji.	nevertheless, despite having a lot more demand, the Central Bank agreed to a request amounting to 60.32 billion shillings and made over 70 billion to be returned to investors.
<21>	Leo, benki Kuu ya Tanzania inatarajia kuuza hati fungani ya miaka 15.	today, the Central Bank of Tanzania is expected to sell a 15-year treasury bond.
<22>	Mchambuzi wa soko amebainisha kwamba kuadimika kwa wawekezaji wa nje kwenye soko la hisa ni ishara ya kwamba wengi wao sasa wanasubiri hisa za kampuni za simu ambazo moja tayari imeshatuma maombi ya kuuza asilimia 25 ya hisa zake.	market analysts have established that the scarcity of the foreign investors in the stock market is a sign that most of them are now waiting for the shares of telecommunication companies where one has already sent a request to sell 25 percent of its shares.
