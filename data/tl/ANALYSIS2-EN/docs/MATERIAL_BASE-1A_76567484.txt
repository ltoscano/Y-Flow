<4>	MWAMUZI wa soka wa kike wa kimataifa, Jonesia Rukyaa amezawadiwa gari na Shirikisho la Soka Tanzania (TFF) kama pongezi kwa kuchezesha kwa mafanikio mechi za fainali za Afrika za Wanawake zilizofanyika Cameroon hivi karibuni ambapo Nigeria iliibuka bingwa.	the national referee of women's soccer, Jonesia Rukyaa, has been awarded a car by the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) as a reward for successfully refereeing the final matches of African women which were played in Cameroon recently and in which Nigeria won the title.
<5>	Rukyaa amefanya jambo hilo akiwa na uzoefu wa miaka miwili tangu apate beji ya Shirikisho la Soka la kimataifa (FIFA).	Rukya has done refereed for two years since she got her International Football Federation Association (FIFA) badge.
<6>	Mwamuzi huyo alipangwa kuchezesha fainali hizo kubwa kwa Afrika zilizofanyika Cameroon, ambapo alichezesha mchezo wa kutafuta mshindi wa tatu kati ya Ghana na Afrika Kusini na kwenye makundi kati ya Cameroon na Zimbabwe.	the referee was scheduled to referee the grand finals of Africa that occurred in Cameroon, where she refereed the games for third place between Ghana and South Africa and in groups between Cameroon and Zimbabwe.
<7>	Kupata nafasi hiyo kubwa na kufanya vizuri kunaonesha dhahiri kuwa Tanzania ina waamuzi bora wa kike.	to get that big chance and to do well shows that Tanzania has got the best female referees.
<8>	Wakati akizungumza juzi na waandishi wa habari Rukyaa alisema aliogopa siku aliyokuwa akichezesha na hata alipokuwa mezani lakini alikuwa akijua anatakiwa afanye nini katika kazi yake hiyo.	when she spoke to the press the day before yesterday, Rukyaa said she was afraid the day she was refereeing and even when she was at the table she knew what she was expected to do in her work.
<9>	Alisema alikuwa makini kuchezesha na pia siku aliyopangwa mezani alijitahidi kwa uwezo wake kusimamia, kuchezesha kwa kuzingatia sheria 17 za soka, bila kuonyesha upendeleo wowote.	she said she was careful to referee and also the day she was scheduled at the table, she tried her best to oversee and referee and focus on the 17 laws of soccer, without taking sides.
<10>	Hakika inafurahisha kuona kuwa mwamuzi huyu ameiletea sifa nchi kwani kuchezesha kwake vizuri kutafungua njia kwa wengine, baada ya kukosa nafasi hiyo kubwa kwa muda mrefu.	it's certainly delightful to see that this referee has brought honor to the country because her refereeing well will open paths for others, after lacking that big opportunity for a long time.
<11>	Kuna umuhimu mkubwa kwa waamuzi wengine wa kike na kiume kufuata nyayo zake kwa kuonesha msimamo wa kazi zao pindi wanapokuwa uwanjani pasipokuangalia sura ya mchezaji au timu.	there is a huge importance for other female and male referees to follow in her footsteps by showing a focus on their work the moment they are in the field without looking at a player's face or team.
<12>	Mwamuzi huyu alisema kuwa kuna waamuzi wengi walitolewa kwenye mashindano hayo baada ya kuvurunda na kubaki wanane waliomaliza hadi mwisho.	this referee said that there are many referees who were removed from the competition after trailing and eight remained who stayed to the end.
<13>	Hakika, kubaki kwake hadi mwisho ilikuwa ni mafanikio makubwa.	truly, her remaining to the end was a big success.
<14>	Miaka ya karibuni kumekuwa na lawama kubwa juu ya uvurugwaji wa mechi unaochangiwa na waamuzi, wengine wakishutumiwa kujihusisha kwenye vitendo vya rushwa.	in recent years, there has been a number of complaints about the disruption to matches contributed by referees, with others being accused of involving themselves in corruption.
<15>	Pia, baadhi yao huchezesha kwa kufuata kelele za mashabiki uwanjani, na wengine wakionesha hofu ya kupigwa kwasababu tu timu fulani ina mashabiki wengi.	also, some of them referee by following the noise from supporters in the field, and others are afraid of being beaten just because a certain team has many supporters.
<16>	Baadhi yao wamekuwa wakilichafua jina la nchi kwa kuchezesha mechi kinyume na sheria 17 za soka, hali ambayo pengine husababishwa kutoaminiwa sio ndani tu bali hata kwenye mechi za kimataifa.	some of them have been smudging the name of the country by playing matches against the 17 rules of soccer, a situation that is potentially caused by lack of trust not only locally but even in international matches.
<17>	Waamuzi wakubali kujifunza na kujiwekea msimamo wa kutoyumbishwa na timu ambazo zina majina makubwa.	referees should agree to learn and show a stand of not being swayed by teams that have big names.
<18>	Umakini uwanjani ndio njia pekee itakayowapa sifa.	attention in the field is the only way that can give them a good reputation.
<19>	Leo mwamuzi huyu amejitahidi kuchezesha vizuri kesho huenda nafasi ikaja kwa mwingine.	today this referee has worked hard to do well, tomorrow the position might go to someone else.
<20>	Kufanya kwake vizuri kunaweza kumpa nafasi zaidi hata kwenye mashindano ya Kombe la dunia siku zijazo.	her doing well might give her more opportunities even in world cup competitions in the future.
<21>	Huenda pia bahati zikafunguka kwa wengine ambao hawajawi iwapo tu watajirekebisha na kuonesha misimamo pasipo kuangalia sura za watu watasema nini juu yake.	fortune may also open to others who haven't, but only if they correct themselves and show a stand without looking at what people's faces will say about him.
<22>	Rukyaa amewatoa wanawake kimasomaso na kitendo ambacho amekionesha kisimfanye akajisahau bali kuongeza umakini wa kazi yake ili hata kwa wanawake wengine wajifunze kwake.	Rukyaa has removed excuses from women as she has shown that should not forget herself but to increase attention in her work so that even other women can learn from her.
<23>	Pia, hata TFF inahitaji pongezi kwa kuwatia moyo waamuzi wanawake na kuendelea kuwaamini kuwa wanaweza.	also, even the TFF needs to be commended for motivating female referees and continuing to believe that they can do it.
<24>	Bila TFF ambayo imekuwa ikiwahimiza wanawake kuhudhuria mafunzo ya waamuzi, pengine wasingejua kama kuna fursa nyingi kama hizo.	without the TFF which has been encouraging women to attend the training for referees, they potentially wouldn't have known if there were many opportunities like this.
<25>	Ni wazi sasa watatambua umuhimu wa kazi hiyo na kujiunga kwa wingi ili kushiriki katika maendeleo ya soka.	it's clear that they will now discover the importance of the work and join in numbers to participate in the progress of soccer.
<26>	Changamoto kwa TFF ni kuendelea kuwahimiza vijana wengi wa kike kushiriki mafunzo pindi fursa hiyo inapojitokeza, kwani waliopo bado ni wachache na tena ikiwezekana wasiishie kusomea leseni za madaraja C na B, bali kujiongeza zaidi.	the challenge for the TFF is to continue encouraging other female youths to participate in training the moment the opportunity arises, because those present are still not a lot and again if possible, they should not end their training at the licenses in grades C and B, but also to progress further than that.
<27>	Pongezi kwako Jonesia kwa ufanisi wako wa kazi.	congratulations to you Jonesia for your efficiency at work.
