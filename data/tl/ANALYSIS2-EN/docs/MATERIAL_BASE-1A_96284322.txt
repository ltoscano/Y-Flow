<1>	Mahakama yatupilia mbali kesi ya uchaguzi TLS	court dismisses TLS election case
<2>	Mahakama Kuu Kanda ya Dar es Salaam leo Machi 16, 2017 imeondoa kesi namba 13 na 14/ 2017 iliyofunguliwa na Wakili wa kujitegemea Onesmo Mpinzile dhidi ya Chama cha Wanasheria Tanganyika (TLS) na Mwanasheria Mkuu wa Serikali (AG), kwa lengo la kuitaka mahakama hiyo kutoa amri ya kuzuia kufanyika uchaguzi wa chama hicho Machi 18, 2017.	today, March 16, 2017, the High Court of Dar es Salaam has removed cases number 13 and 14/2017 which were opened by independent lawyer, Onesmo Mpinzile, against the Tanzania Law Society (TLS) and Attorney General of the Government (AG) with an aim of getting the court to issue an order which would prevent the society from conducting its election on March 18, 2017
<3>	Pia, lengo lingine la Wakili Mpinzile kuifungua kesi hiyo, ni kupinga kanuni za uchaguzi za TLS za mwaka 2016 ambapo aliitaka mahakama itamke kuwa ni batili kwa madai kuwa zilisainiwa na kupitishwa na mtu ambaye hakuwa na mamlaka katika chama hicho.	also, another reason lawyer Mpinzile opened the case was to oppose the TLS election rules of the year 2016 where he hoped the court would declare the rules were invalid due to claims that they were signed and passed by someone who did not have authority in the party
<4>	Wakati akizungumza na waandishi wa habari asubuhi ya leo Machi 16, 2017, baada ya shauri hilo kuondolewa, Wakili upande wa TLS, Sinare Zaharan amesema Jaji wa Mahakama Kuu Ignus Kitusi aliyekuwa anasikiliza shauri hilo, aliliondoa baada ya kukubali hoja tatu zilizotolewa na mawakili waliokuwa wanakiwakilisha chama hicho na serikali.	while speaking to journalists this morning, March 16, 2017, after the case had been removed, the TLS lawyer, Sinare Zaharan said that the High Court Judge Ignus Kitusi who had listened to the case, removed it after accepting three arguments that were given by the lawyers representing the party and the government
<5>	“Mahakama imekubalina na hoja ya mapingamizi ya wali yaliyotolewa na mawakili waliokuwa wanawakilisha TLS na serikali, ambapo hoja ya kwanza ilisema aliyeleta pingamizi hana mamlaka kisheria sababu hakuweza kuithibitishia mahakama kama yeye ni mwanachama wa TLS wakati anawasilisha maombi yake, hoja ya pili ilikuwa hati ya mashitaka ilikuwa ina mapungufu ya kisheria na kwamba ilikuwa inatoa ushauri na majumuisho,” amesema Wakili Zaharan	"the court has contended with the arguments of objections that were made by the lawyers representing TLS and the government, where the first argument stated that the person who filed the objection has no legal authority because he could not prove to the court that he was a member of TLS at the time he submitted his application, the second argument was that the indictment certificate had legal limitations and that it was giving advice and inclusions," said lawyer Zaharan
<6>	Zaharan ameongeza kuwa, hoja ya tatu iliyokubaliwa na Jaji Kitusi ni kwamba Wakili Mpinzile aliifungua kesi hiyo ya kikatiba mahakamani hapo, pasipo kufuata hatua za awali ndani ya chama hicho.	Zaharan has added that the third argument accepted by Judge Kitusi was that lawyer Mpinzile filed the constitutional case there in court, without following the initial procedures in the party
<7>	Aidha, maamuzi hayo ya Mahakama Kuu yamekuja siku moja baada ya jopo la majaji wa mahakama hiyo wakiwemo Rose Teemba na Beatrice Mutungi na Ignus Mutungi kusikiliza hoja za pande zote ambapo leo ilikuwa ni siku ya kutolewa maamuzi ya mapingamizi hayo.	furthermore, the decisions of the High Court have come one day after a panel of judges of the court including Rose Teemba, Beatrice Mutungi and Ignus Mutungi had listened to the arguments of all sides and today was the day of providing decisions on those objections
