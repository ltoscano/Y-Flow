<3>	KASISI wa kitengo cha Kikristo katika jeshi (KDF) Meja Francis Mutua Ndolo aliangalia mshahara wake wa Sh24, 000 akijumuisha marupurupu, kisha akafanya hesabu ya Sh45, 000 kwa mwezi alizokuwa akizoa kutoka sekta ya kilimo na mwaka wa 1995 akaamua kujitoa kutoka ajira ya kulinda nchi na kuwa mlishaji nchi kupitia kilimo.	a chaplain of the Christian section in the army (KDF), Major Francis Mutua Ndolo, looked at his salary of 24,000 shillings, together with his allowances, then he added the 45,000 shillings per month he was getting from the agriculture sector and in 1995, he decided to quit his job of defending the country and became a supporter of the country through agriculture.
<4>	Na katika kisa cha mvumilivu kuishia kula mbivu, mwanajeshi huyu alipambana na maisha, akipanda na kuteremka katika harakati hizo hadi kiwango cha sasa ambapo kwa mwaka anaunda faida ya kati ya Sh2.4 milioni na Sh3 milioni katika msimu wa miezi sita, kutegemea mazingara ya soko la mboga na matunda.	and in the story of the patient person who ended up eating the ripe fruit, this soldier dealt with life, climbing and coming down in those struggles until the level he's at now where he makes an annual profit between 2.4 million shillings and 3 million shillings in a season of six months, depending on the environment of the fruit and vegetable market.
<5>	Kwa sasa, Meja Mstaafu Ndolo huishi maisha ya utajiri huku akiwa pia mwalimu kwa wakulima chipukizi na ambapo huwaelekeza katika njia mwafaka za kugeuza ploti zao zisizo na nafasi za kilimo kugeuka kuwa mashamba yenye rotuba na ya kuwaundia pesa.	for now, retired Major Ndolo lives a life of wealth while also being a teacher to young farmers, leading them through the proper way to turn their plots which have no space for agriculture and turning them into fertile farms that make them money.
<6>	Katika maamuzi hayo, Bw Ndolo ambaye ni mfuasi wa dini ya Kipentekosti, alitamatisha huduma zake za miaka 15 katika jeshi na akaingilia kazi ya kilimo ambapo mwanzoni alikuwa akifuga kuku wa mayai na nyama.	in those decisions, Mister Ndolo, who is an adherent of the Pentecost faith, ended his 15-year service in the military and entered farming, starting with keeping chickens for eggs and meat.
<7>	Kutenganishwa na familia Kulingana naye, kazi hiyo ya kijeshi ilikuwa na `stresi' nyingi, yaani sumbufu, ambazo zilijumuisha kutenganishwa na familia yake kila mara alipotumwa katika kazi za kueweka amani katika mataifa ya ng'ambo na pia kuhangaika akingoja marupurupu ambayo kila mara yalikuwa yakipunguzwa na wakubwa wake kwa njia za ufisadi.	according to him, being separate from family in the military job caused a lot of 'stress', that is disturbance, which added to the separation from his family every time he was sent to peacekeeping work in countries abroad, and was also anxious while waiting for his allowances which was reduced many times by his seniors through corrupt means.
<8>	"Ndipo nilipata Sh270, 000 kama kitita cha kustaafu na hatimaye nikaingilia kazi ya kufuga kuku ambayo nilikuwa nimeianza mwaka wa 1989," asema.	"that's when I got 270,000 shillings as my lump sum for retirement and later I began the work of keeping chickens which I started in 1989," he says.
<9>	Mambo yalikuwa shwari katika biashara yake ambapo katika mikataba yake na soko, aliunda pesa kwa uepesi na akafanikiwa kujijenga kupitia masomo kwa wanawe wawili na pia kununulia familia yake ploti katika mtaa wa Baraka ulioko katika eneo la Landless, Thika, Kaunti ya Kiambu.	things were good in his business through his contracts with the market, so he made money quickly and successfully built him business through educating his two children and also through buying his family plots in Baraka estate that is in the landless area, Thika, in Kiambu.
<10>	Hata hivyo, changamoto kadha zilianza kumwandama katika sekta hiyo ya kuku ambapo ufisadi wa watengenezaji chakula walimtwika hasara ya kwanza ya takriban Sh180, 000 mwaka wa 1990 ambapo kuku 1, 000 walitaga mayai kwa mwezi mmoja tu na wakakoma kutaga tena.	even so, various challenges began following him in the chicken sector whereby the corruption of chicken feed manufacturers made him suffer losses, the first of approximately 180,000 shillings in 1990 where 1,000 chickens laid eggs for only one month and stopped laying after.
<11>	"Nilipofuatilia kiini cha tukio hilo lisilo la kawaida; nilifahamishwa na wataalamu kuwa chakula cha kuku sokoni kilikuwa kimedunishwa kupitia kuwekwa mchanga na chembechembe za mbao," asema.	"when I followed the core of the abnormal incident, I was informed by experts that the chicken feed in the market was made worthless by being mixed with sand and saw dust," he says.
<12>	Anasema kuwa kuku walipokula chakula hicho, kile walichofanya ni kuongeza uzani ambao hatimaye uliwasababishia mishipa ya kutaga mayai kujifunga na hivyo basi kugeuza kuku wake wa kutaga kuwa wa nyama.	he says that when the chicken ate it, they gained weight which finally made the vessels for laying eggs close and therefore converted his chicken from layers to broilers.
<13>	"Niliwauza na ndipo nikanunua kuku wengine, safari hii kwa fujo kwa Picha/Maktaba kuwa nilinunua kuku wa nyama 3, 000.	"I sold them and then bought other chickens, this time with excitement with the picture/file that I bought 3000 broilers".
<14>	Nikaunda faida na nikaamua kuongeza uwekezaji wangu hadi kuku 12, 000," asema.	I made a profit and decided to increase my investment up to 12,000 chickens," he says.
<15>	Ndipo shetani aliangukia biashara hiyo yake mwaka wa 2002 ambapo kulizuka ugonjwa hatari wa homa ya kuku ulimwenguni na akaanza kupoteza biashara na faida kwa kasi iliyomwacha hoi.	then the devil fell on his business in 2002 when the dangerous bird flu disease arose in the world, and he started losing his business and profit at a rate that left him helpless.
<16>	"Nilikuwa na akiba ya Sh1.7 milioni katika akaunti yangu ya benki na iliporomoka hadi nikajipata nimezama katika lindi la madeni.	"I had savings of 1.7 million shillings in my bank account and it collapsed until I found myself drowned in debt".
<17>	Sikuwa na lingine ila tu kuwachana na kuku nikisaka njia nyingine ya kujinu suru," asema.	I had no choice except to leave chickens, I looked for another way to save myself," he says.
<18>	Lakini, Mungu hamtaliki mja wake, asema kwa kuwa baada ya mahangaiko, alipata njia ya kujinusuru kabisa mwaka wa 2013 ambapo aliingilia teknolojia mpya ya kilimo katika magunia spesheli.	but, God doesn't divorce one who comes to him, he says after those troubles, he found a way of saving himself in 2013 when he joined in the new agricultural technology in special sacks.
<19>	"Hii ni teknolojia ambayo hujumuisha kulima aina za mboga na matunda ndani ya magunia yaliyo na uwezo wa kupandwa mimea 80 kwa kila gunia," asema.	"this technology, which combines farming of types of vegetable and fruits inside a sack, has the ability to plant 80 crops in each sack," he says.
<20>	Gunia hilo lenye upana wa futi tatu na urefu wa futi nne huwa limetobolewa mashimo kando kando na kisha hujazwa mchanga na mbolea na kisha mimea kupandwa katika kiingilio cha gunia hilo na pia katika mashimo yaliyo kando yake.	the sack, which is three feet wide and four feet long, is usually punctured with holes in the sides and then filled with soil and fertilizer and then crops are planted at the opening of the sack at the top and in the holes that are on its side.
<21>	Teknolojia "Umuhimu wa teknolojia hii ni kuwa, hugeuza hata shamba la mawe kuwa shamba la kujistawisha na pia katika nafasi ambayo kwa shamba la kawaida inaweza kupandwa mimea miwili pekee, gunia hilo huzidisha mimea hiyo hadi 80," asema.	technology "the importance of this technology is that it converts even a stony garden to a garden of self-development and also in a space where normally two crops would be planted, this sack can take up to 80 crops," he says.
<22>	Alinunua magunia hayo spesheli 100 na akaanza kupanda mimea aina ya mboga za sukuma, spinachi na nyanya.	he bought 100 special sacks and started planting crops like vegetables such as kale, spinach, and tomatoes.
<23>	"Kila mmea mmoja wa nyanya hunipa faida ya Sh30 na wakati nimepanda mimea hiyo 8, 000, faida kwa kila gunia hadi awamu ya mavuno itamatike huwa ni Sh240, 000.	"every crop of tomatoes gives me a profit of 30 shillings and when I have planted 8,000 of that crop, profits in each sack at the end of the harvest season is usually 240,000 shillings.
<24>	Ukihesabu faida hiyo na mimea ndani ya magunia 100, utapata kuwa faida hupanda hadi Sh24 milioni," asema.	if you count that profit and the crops in 100 sacks, you will get profits that rise up to 24 million shillings," he says.
<25>	Kadhalika, wakati amepanda mboga aina ya spinach na kisha kuuza kila tawi moja kwa Sh3, faida kwa vuno moja huwa ni Sh240 kwa kila gunia.	moreover, when he plants vegetables like one type of spinach and then sells each branch for 3 shillings, profits for one harvest usually is 240 shillings for each sack.
<26>	Ukijumuisha magunia yote 100, pesa hizo hupanda hadi Sh24, 000 kwa siku.	if you put all 100 sacks, that money increases to 24,000 shillings per day.
<27>	"Uzuri wa spinachi ni kuwa unaweza kuvuna kwa kipindi cha mwaka mmoja mfululizo na faida hiyo itapanda hata Sh30 milioni ," asema.	"the advantage of spinach is that you can harvest it continuously in a one year period and that profit will climb to even 30 million shillings," he says.
