<3>	Makamu wa Kwanza wa Rais wa Shirikisho la Mpira wa Miguu Tanzania (TFF), ambaye pia anawania Urais wa shirikisho hilo katika Uchaguzi Mkuu wa TFF, Athuman Nyamlani amesema ataendeleza mafanikio mazuri ndani ya shirikisho hilo endapo atachaguliwa tena.	the first Vice President of the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF), who is also contesting for the presidency of the federation in the general TTF elections, Athuman Nyamlani, has said that he will continue the great success of the federation if he will be elected again.
<4>	Uchaguzi Mkuu wa TFF unatarajiwa kufanyika keshokutwa, ambapo uongozi ulio chini ya Rais wake Leodegar Tenga unamaliza muda wake.	the TFF general election is expected for the day after tomorrow, when the tenure of its president, Leodegar Tenga, will come to an end.
<5>	Akizungumza Dar es Salaam jana, Nyamlani alisema kuwa kwanza kabisa anajivunia mafanikio waliyoyaleta TFF akiwa na uongozi mzima wa TFF chini ya Rais wake Tenga, hivyo pale walipoishia ataendeleza mazuri endapo tu wajumbe watampa ridhaa ya kuwa Rais wa TFF.	speaking in Dar es Salaam yesterday, Nyamlani said, first and foremost, he takes pride in the success they have brought to TFF together with the full TFF team under the leadership of President Tenga, so he will keep up the good work from where they left off once the delegates choose him to be the TFF President.
<6>	“Ni ukweli usiofichika kwamba katika kipindi cha uongozi wa Tenga ambaye mimi nilikuwa msaidizi wake mkuu tumepata mafanikio makubwa sana yakiwemo ya kujenga mfumo imara wa uendeshaji wa soka nchini kwa kuimarisha menejimenti ya soka, ligi kuu na timu ya Taifa.	it is a truth that can't be hidden that, in the period of the Tenga's leadership for whom I was his general assistant, we have achieved great success including the building of firm systems to manage soccer in the country by strengthening the management of soccer, the premier league, and the national team.
<7>	“Mafanikio haya yaliongeza uaminifu wa shirikisho hilo kwa wadhamini na wafadhili mbalimbali jambo ambalo tumelishuhudia wote kuwa tumepata wadhamini mbalimbali wa mashindano yetu na hii yote ni kazi ya uongozi wa mheshimiwa Tenga,” alisema Nyamlani.	"this success had added trust in the federation from our sponsors and several donors, something that we have all witnessed since we have found several donors of our competitions and all of this is the work of the leadership of honorable Tenga," said Nyamlani.
<8>	Alisema hakuna kazi yoyote inayoleta mafanikio bila ya kuwa na changamoto zake na anakiri kwamba walikutana na changamoto mbalimbali katika utekelezaji wa majukumu yao, jambo ambalo kwa kiasi kikubwa ndilo lililomfanya aamue kufanya uamuzi mgumu wa kuomba ridhaa ya Watanzania kuongoza tena TFF.	he said there is no work that brings success without also having its challenges and he admits that they met various challenges in the completion of their duties, something that heavily influenced his thoughts to make the difficult decision by asking for the pardon of Tanzanians to lead the TFF again.
<9>	Nyamlani anasema ni kwa sababu anazijua changamoto nyingi ambazo zimekuwa zikiukumba mchezo wa soka nchini hivyo atakuwa hajatenda haki kwa nafasi yake, mchezo wa soka na Taifa lake kwa kuwa mbinafsi kiasi cha kuamua kutogombea na hivyo kushindwa kutumia uzoefu wake katika kuendeleza mafanikio waliyoyapata na kutatua changamoto mbalimbali zilizojitokeza na zitakazojitokeza.	Nyamlani says it is because he knows many challenges have been hitting the game of soccer in the country and that he will not have done justice to his space or the game of soccer for his nation by being selfish to the point of deciding not to run and in that way, being unable to use his experience to continue the success they have gotten and to solve different challenges that have come out and will come out.
<10>	Hivyo basi kwa kuzingatia uwekezaji waliouweka katika soka kwa kipindi cha takriban miaka nane sasa, hasa suala la timu za taifa kushiriki katika mashindano ya kimataifa kama vile Kombe la Mataifa ya Afrika na kombe la Dunia, jambo ambalo kwa maoni yake na uzoefu wake tunakaribia kulifikia na kama atapata ridhaa ya Watanzania(Wajumbe wa Mkutano Mkuu).	therefore, taking into consideration the investment that they have put in football for approximately the last eight years, especially with the issue of the national teams participating in international competitions such as the African cup of nations and the world cup, something that, in his opinion and experience, we are close to achieving if he gets the approval of Tanzanians (delegates of the general meeting).
<11>	Alisema kuna mambo tisa ambayo atayatekeleza endapo atachaguliwa kuwa Rais wa TFF.	he said there are nine things that he will accomplish if elected to be the TFF President.
<12>	Mambo hayo ni kuimarisha usimamizi na menejimenti ya soka katika ngazi zote, rushwa katika soka nchini, kukuza soka la watoto, vijana na wanawake, kuimarisha uwezo na rasilimali fedha wa shirikisho, kuongeza idadi na ubora wa waamuzi, walimu wa soka na wataalamu wa afya ya michezo.	those things are: to strengthen administration and management of football on all levels, football bribes in the country, nurturing football in children, boys and girls, strengthen the ability and financial resources in the federation, increasing the quality and number of referees, coaches, and sports medicine experts.
<13>	Pia kuongeza ubora wa ligi kuu, daraja la kwanza, ligi za wilaya na mikoa, kuongeza idadi ya mawakala na wachezaji ambao ni Watanzania, kuimarisha ushirikiano wa TFF na Serikali na ushirikiano na CAF na FIFA.	also upgrading the quality of the premier league, division one, district and provincial leagues, increasing the number of agents and Tanzanian players, strengthening the cooperation between the TFF and the government and the partnership with CAF and FIFA.
