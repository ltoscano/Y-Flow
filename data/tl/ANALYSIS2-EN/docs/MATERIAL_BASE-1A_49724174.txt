<1>	Wanaovunja sheria kwa nguvu wanajivunia nini?	those who break the law by force what are they proud of?
<2>	Mhariri, kuna matukio ambayo kila ninapoyaona kwenye vyombo vya habari huwa siamini kama yanatokea Tanzania, nchi inayotajwa kubobea kwenye amani na utulivu.	editor, there are occurrences that whenever I see them in the media, I always do not want to believe they happen in Tanzania, a country that is mentioned to indulge in peace and calmness.
<3>	Moja ya matukio hayo ni matumizi ya nguvu yanayofanywa na baadhi ya watu ambao kwa makusudi huamua kwenda kinyume na sheria, taratibu na kanuni zilizowekwa.	one of those occurrence was the use of force by some people who deliberately decide to break the law, the order and conditions placed.
<4>	Nimesikia mara kadhaa watu wakilalamika kuwa kundi la mabaunsa lilivamia nyumba zao na kuzibomoa licha ya kuwapo hati za mahakama za kuzuia ubomoaji huo.	I have heard several people complaining that groups of bouncers invade people's houses and demolish them despite the availability of court document to stop the demolition.
<5>	Kwa nini watu wanaweza kukiuka amri ya mahakama na kufanya uharibifu wa nyumba, tena huku wakijitapa kuwa mwenye nyumba aende kokote anakotaka.	why do people ignore a court order and cause destruction to a house, bragging to the owner they can go anywhere they want?
<6>	Kwa nini mtu anaweza kufikia uamuzi kama huo katika nchi inayotajwa kuheshimu utawala wa sheria na haki za binadamu?	why should someone reach a decision like that in a country known to respect the rule of law and human rights?
<7>	Natamani kupata majibu ya maswali yangu.	I desire to get answers to my questions.
