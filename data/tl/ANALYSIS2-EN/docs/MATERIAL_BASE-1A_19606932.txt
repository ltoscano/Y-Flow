<4>	MAMLAKA ya Mapato Tanzania (TRA) imeahidi kutoa Sh milioni 50 kwa ajili ya kuchimba kisima kitakachowawezesha wananchi wa Kijiji cha Njoroi Kata ya Ololosokwan Wilaya ya Ngorongoro, kilichopo mpakani mwa Tanzania na Kenya kwa ajili ya kunywesha mifugo yao nchini.	the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) has promised to give 50 million shillings for digging wells, to enable the citizens of Njoroi Village, Ololosokwan Ward, Ngoronoro District, located at the border of Tanzania and Kenya, to feed their livestock in the country.
<5>	Aidha Mkuu wa Mkoa wa Arusha, Mrisho Gambo, amewasihi wananchi wa wilaya hiyo, kuachana na wachonganishi wasiopenda maendeleo, badala yake washirikiane na serikali kuwabaini wanaochochea migogoro katika eneo la Loliondo.	additionally, the head of Arusha Province, Mrisho Gambo, has urged the citizens of that district to separate from agitators who do not like development, and instead cooperate with the government to identify those inciting chaos in the area of Loliondo.
<6>	Wakizungumza jana kwa nyakati tofauti wilayani humo, Kamishna Mkuu wa TRA, Alphayo Kidata, alisema amefika eneo hilo lililopo mpakani mwa nchi ya Tanzania na Kenya ili kuangalia ni wapi TRA kwa kushirikiana na uhamiaji, wanaweza kujenga kituo cha kisasa cha forodha kwa ajili ya kusaidia serikali pamoja na jamii inayotumia eneo hilo kwa ajili ya kulipa kodi.	speaking at different times in the district, the head commissioner of TRA, Alphayo Kidata, said he had gone to the area bordering Tanzania and Kenya to see where TRA, in conjunction with immigration, could build a modern customs station to support the government, together with the community that uses the area, for the purpose of paying tax.
<7>	Alisema katika eneo hilo, amegundua kuwa serikali inakosa mapato mengi kutokana na biashara kubwa ya mnada wa ng'ombe unaofanyika kila Jumatatu huku nchi ya Kenya ikinunua mifugo kutoka Tanzania bila kulipa ushuru na wakati Watanzania wakitaka kwenda Kenya kupitia eneo hilo, wanatozwa ushuru.	he said in that area, he realized that the government was missing out on a lot of income from the huge cattle auction that takes place every Monday, with Kenya buying cattle from Tanzania without paying taxes, while Tanzanians going to Kenya through the area are charged tax.
<8>	Alisema kujengwa kwa vituo vya pamoja vya forodha kwenye mpaka wa Kenya na Tanzania eneo la Olaika na Ormit, kutasaidia kuondoa mwingiliano holela na kuongeza wingi wa kasi ya biashara baina ya wananchi wa pande zote mbili.	he said construction of inclusive customs centers at the border of Kenya and Tanzania, in the region of Olaika and Ormit, will help eliminate careless interference and increase the speed of business between citizens of the two areas.
<9>	TRA itatoa fedha hizo ili kujenga kisima kwa ajili ya mifugo ili kupata maji kwa wananchi wa Tanzania ili kutoenda Kenya au wakati mwingine kuzuiwa watu wa Kenya, kuipeleka mifugo kunywa maji nchini mwao.	TRA will give the money to construct a well for the sake of the livestock, to get water for the Tanzanian citizens so they don't have to go to Kenya, or at other times be blocked by the Kenyan people from taking their cattle to drink water in their country.
<10>	Mkurugenzi wa Kitalu cha Uwindaji cha OBC, Issack Mollel alisema watajenga kisima kimoja eneo hilo ili kuwaondolea wananchi wa eneo hilo kero ya kuzuiwa kunywesha mifugo yao nchini Kenya.	the director of OBC Hunting Enclosure, Issack Mollel, said they will build a well in that area to eliminate the nuisance of citizens getting blocked from Kenya when having their animals drink.
<11>	Mkuu wa Mkoa wa Arusha, Gambo aliwashukuru TRA na OBC kwa kutatua kero hiyo na kutoa rai kwa wananchi kuwafichukua wale wote wanaochochea migogoro eneo hilo la Loliondo, sambamba na kushirikiana kwa pamoja katika kuhakikisha wilaya hiyo inapata maendeleo.	the head of Arusha Province, Gambo, thanked TRA and OBC for solving the problem, and advised citizens to reveal those inciting chaos in that area of Loliondo, plus cooperate with each other to ensure the district gets the developments.
<12>	Pia aliwasihi kushirikiana na Mbunge wa jimbo hilo, William ole Nasha kwani yeye ndio aliyetoa hoja yake serikalini ya kujenga kituo cha forodha eneo hilo ili wananchi wanufaike na mapato na kuendesha shughuli zao za biashara na kujikwamua kuuchumi.	he also urged them to cooperate with the parliamentarian of that country, William Ole Nasha, because he's the one who brought the bill to the government, to build the customs center in the area, so that the citizens can benefit from the income and run their business activities and thrive economically.
<13>	Mkuu wa wilaya hiyo, Rashid Taka alisisitiza kuwa ni vyema kituo hicho kikajengwa eneo hilo ili kupunguza wimbi la wahamiaji haramu pamoja na kila nchi wahusika wake kulipa kodi kutokana na bidhaa wanazonunua.	the head of the district, Rashid Taka, insisted that it was good for the center to be built there, to reduce the wave of illegal immigrants together with each country's participants paying tax on the products they are buying.
