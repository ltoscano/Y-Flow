Climate change pact ‘di iraratipika ng Senado By Aries Cano July 20, 2016 Hindi na iraratipika ng Senado ang Paris Agreement on Climate Change kasunod ng pahayag ni Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte na hindi nito kikilalanin ang naturang kasunduan.
Ayon kay outgoing Senate President Franklin Drilon, kinikilala nito ang kapangyarihan ni Pangulong Duterte bilang “architect” at “principal actor” sa foreign policy at may karapatan ito na hindi kilalanin ang kasunduan kapag hindi naaakma sa polisiya ng bansa.
“The President is the architect of our foreign policy. He’s the principal actor in so far as foreign policy is concerned. The role of the Senate is treaty ratification. If President Duterte, as a matter of policy, has decided that we will not ratify the agreement, then that is a prerogative that he has as Chief Executive. If he does not send to the Senate the treaty for ratification, then it is not binding on our country. That is a policy that his administration has adopted,” pahayag ni Drilon.
Ang reaksyon ni Drilon ay kakawing ng pahayag ni Pangulong Duterte hindi kikilalanin ang kasunduan na tinawag pa nitong “stupid” at “absurd.”
Dinagdag ni Drilon na kung ia-adopt ng susunod na lider ng bansa ang panibagong polisya ay magkakaroon ng tsansa na maratipikihan ito ng Senado at magaging parte ng batas ng bansa.
“But as of today, the President has decided that he will not ratify the treaty and the Senate has no opportunity to concur in the ratification,” sabi ni Drilon.
