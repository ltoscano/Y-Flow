Meeting ni Duterte kay Obama kanselado SSeptember 6, 2016
Kanselado ang kauna-unahan sanang pagpupulong nina Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte at United States President Barack Obama sa sidelines ng ASEAN Summit sa Vientiane, Laos.
Sa naging matapang at walang prenong pahayag ni Duterte sa lider ng Amerika, tinanong ni Obama ang kanyang staff para masukat kung magiging productive ba kung matutuloy ang paghaharap nilang dalawa.
“Clearly, he’s a colorful guy,” ani Obama. “What I’ve instructed my team to do is talk to their Philippine counterparts to find out is this in fact a time where we can have some constructive, productive conversations.” Kasunod nito, kinansela ng White House itong Martes ang nasabing pinlanong bilateral meeting at sa halip ay haharapin na lamang ni Obama si presidente ng Korea na si Park Geun-hye.
“President Obama will not be holding a bilateral meeting with President Duterte of the Philippines,” ayon kay US National Security Council spokesman Ned Price.
Bunsod pa rin nito, may hiwalay na statement din si Duterte sa naudlot na pagpupulong.
“The meeting between the United States and the Philippines has been mutually agreed upon to be moved to a later date.
“While the immediate cause was my strong comments to certain press questions that elicited concern and distress, we also regret it came across as a personal attack on the US President.
“Our primary intention is to chart an independent foreign policy while promoting closer ties with all nations, especially the US with which we have a had a long standing partnership.
“We look forward to ironing out differences arising out of national priorities and perceptions, and working in mutually responsible ways for both countries.”
