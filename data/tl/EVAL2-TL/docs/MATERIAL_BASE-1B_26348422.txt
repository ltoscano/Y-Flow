Puring-puri ng chief executive and founder ng One Mega Group na si Sari Yap sina Alden Richards at Maine Mendoza, nang magkasama sila para sa isang special cover shoot in Morocco kamakailan.
Sa kanyang Instagram post, nag-share siya ng kanyang experience na katrabaho sina Alden and Maine.

Unang nakatrabaho ni Sari si Alden noong 2012 pa noong makasama ito sa isang group cover shoot kunsaan kasama pa nito sina Kris Bernal, Bela Padilla at Sarah Lahbati.
Hindi akalain ni Sari na 4 years after ay magiging isa sa sought-after celebrities si Alden dahil sa AlDub phenomenon. Napansin nga ni Sari na kahit sikat na sikat na si Alden, hindi ito apektado ng kanyang fame at nakatapak pa rin ang mga paa nito sa lupa.
“Alden Richards, I have known from before Aldub fame. His first group cover for @mega_magazine was 4 years ago and we would always have short but deep conversations during Mega events.

‘My favorite topic was always about guarding against fame getting into your head.
“Alden was always an attentive student. ‘Ayan, nangyari na,’ I say to him, as we sit down to have lunch in Marrakech. He is like an eager young boy, always keeping an eye on his phone, looking for pokemons. ‘Oo nga, ho,’ he smiles, and gives me his full attention. ‘I can see hindi ka nagbago. Good,’ I tell him. ‘Hindi po,’ he confirms,” post pa ni Sari.
Si Maine naman daw ay parang “makulit little sister” para kay Sari. At ang napansin pa niya ay hindi aware si Maine kung gaano ito kasikat. Tahimik lang daw ito pero biglang lumalabas daw ang pagiging makulit nito.
“What I really think after 3 days of working with her? The girl is a riot a minute! She is quiet for a bit until she gets to know you, then she becomes everyone’s makulit little sister.
“She is oblivious to fame, which is why fame hounds her. The @mega_magazine team is missing her now that she is on her way home…”
Kapwa nasa bansa na nga sina Alden at Maine at nitong nakaraang Tuesday ay nag-celebrate sila ng kanilang 13th monthsary.
