Wagi ang Philippine Residents rugby team sa Sabah Eagles, 25-19, nitong weekend sa Southern Plains, Calamba, Laguna.
Ang PRRT ang pinaghalong Phil. Volcanoes at best local rugby players na residente sa bansa. Dito huhugutin ang 2017 Philippine Volcanoes Men’s 15s National Team na kakampanya sa Asia Rugby Championship Division 1 title sa Abril 2017 kontra Sri Lanka, Malaysia at United Arab Emirates.
“The game was heavy from the start, both teams were physical and very committed. Extremely happy that the team performed well,” hayag ni Residents coach David Johnston. Kabado ang Residents sa unang limang minuto ng girina, pero sa tulungan nina Timothy Bweheni na tumibag sa linya at napa-dive si Sosiveta Rura Boila para makatabla.
akadepensa ang host squad at na-set up ni veteran Philippine Volcano member Justin Villazor Coveney si Masayuki Sekiguchi upang makasipa na naglagak sa Residents sa 10-7 lead at di na lumingon pa.
“Our performance in the first half was suprisingly very good, you could see our game plan and shape falling into place. Our outside backs were suberb, thanks to quality of clean ball from our forward pack” ani Residents team skipper Jake Letts.
