Kris ‘di inisnab ni PDU30 — Andanar By Boyet Jadulco November 14, 2016
Matapos sabihin ng aktres at TV host Kris Aquino na ‘epic snub’ ang hindi pagdalo ni Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte sa dapat sanang one-on-one interview niya dito noong Biyernes, nilinaw naman ng isang opisyal ng Malacañang na hindi inisnab ng Pangulo ang aktres.
Ayon kay Presidential Communications Office (PCO) Secretary Martin Andanar, nagkataon lang na masama ang pakiramdam ng Pangulo.
“There was no intention to snub Kris Aquino. Again, ulitin ko po, the alter ego of the President at the Department of Trade and Industry, Secretary Mon Lopez is there, he’s the one who spoke on behalf of the President. Kris Aquino was there. Joey Concepcion was there. Government agencies that are responsible to cover the President were present,” paliwanag ni Andanar. “It just so happened that the President was not feeling well,” diin pa ng kalihim. Naniniwala naman si Andanar na maaari pang mare-schedule ang interview ni Kris Aquino kay Pangulong Duterte.
“Anything, anything is a possibility. Everything is a possibility,” wika ni Andanar.
