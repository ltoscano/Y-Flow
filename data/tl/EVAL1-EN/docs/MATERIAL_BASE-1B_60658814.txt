The CHR against BE, Tina Mendoza June 19, 2016, for Malaca√±ang, is not the basis of the call to separate the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) because aside from the law, the agency is a mandate of the agency to take care of even criminals or victims of violence.
Again the call to separate the CHR is hot because of the frequent defense of the crime similar to those who are doing the crime, just like with a hint of a gun from the authorities, the CHR wants to investigate the police because of his weapons.
Coloma explained that the CHR is a independent office that was formed under the Constitution, to investigate all kinds of human rights that is why all the citizens are under the protection of our Saligang Batas, that is why all the citizens are under the protection of the CHR that should be slow down.
