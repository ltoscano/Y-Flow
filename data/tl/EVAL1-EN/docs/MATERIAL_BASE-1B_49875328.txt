My room.

My room to me (Jony. 14-1) inside the house is our favorite room, we are taking a bath when we do not have a risk when there is a lot of problems, there should be no computers and there should be no things that would stop going to rest.

It should be pleasant for waking up and it is also good for us to be happy because this is also the reason why we work together in the kingdom of God, this is the reason why we want us to go to Jesus and for sure we will give us a room where we can breathe.
