No word to grieve.

Until the swelling of grief has been started, anything.

To forget, sore.

Yesterday, I met a person, who is one of our fellowmen, he is insinuating with the situation of life, and they are looking for a lot of things that is very important to him, and it's the first time that her youngest child's suicide is almost leisure and escape from the truth.

He is always distressed and blames herself for the painful chapter on his family.

At the age of 50 years, he is trying to find out his spiritual identity, which is the only purpose of his life, what does he want to do, what kind of personality will happen to him, and how the married couple will be relieved.

I have mentioned it to him: When your father and mother died, you are orphaned by your husband, because if you lost a child, there is no sufficient effect on your heart and it will not be resolved yet and it will not be resolved yet and it will remain in a memory only.

In different views in my mind, how will she be relieved of what happened to her family, what I really want to do and experience changes in their life - what I really want is to face the truth and what's true is to love the truth, and good life to live. "

What is the meaning of grieve?

Intense grief, sadness and sadness of the death of a loved one or things that you have most beloved because of the disappearance, they continue to be vigilant and may cause diabetes.

There is only a little grief for the things that we cannot avoid and we do not have control and we do not have self-control and the majority of suffering will be seen without terror and truly suffering from the truth.

Is you going to continue the slave of the past and the nightmare that happened?
