Maguindanao, involved in drugs, By Al Jacinto, 26, 2016.
Zamboanga City - one of the members of the losing presidential candidate, Esmael Mangudadatu, the governor of Maguindanao, allegedly submitted to President-elect Rodrigo Duterte on the list of politicians involved in drugs in his province.
It was stated by Mangudadatu, who is a member of the Liberal Party, to his accomplice yesterday in the town of Buluan.
But Mangudadatu refused to name those who are accused of his list if he did not say how to prove the accusations or if his opponents are with the politician, particularly the clan of Ampatuan, who is currently in position in Maguindanao.
Maguindanao is said to be the source of illegal drugs in Mindanao, particularly shabu, and a big suspicion that there is a laboratory there.
Mangudadatu also did not say how he gave Duterte the list, many of those who were able to go down and transferred to Duterte's camp.
Duterte first threatened the drug lords in order to pass down if not to stop using drugs.
