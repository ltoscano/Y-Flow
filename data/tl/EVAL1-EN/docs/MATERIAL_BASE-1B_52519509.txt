Relay in the straight path by PNoy.

President Noynoy Aquino has no reaction in relation to the first time that we have stated on the anomalous more than P56,M CCTV project in Subic which affects the Depcom of Budget and Management Council in 2007.
This is the truth: The name of the said project is Bombo Fotoplay (RFID) and Security Association of DBM (SSP) of Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (May 13, 2007, the Propaganda of DBM and Gaming Corporation (May 13, 2007.
DBM was paid by the SBMA because DBM was able to pay the approval of the Philippines Micavers, that before the contract on PM 8 last August. 15, 2007, the project was already paid for almost every year when the RFID and CAAP) did not have any intention to end it.
If the project was finished, it would have been lessened before, if you were not able to stop, the nonsense of the gates of Subic Gateway Park will be lessened because you can monitor all those who are going out and going to the entire Golder sister, Rizal Gelder sister and even in Sta. Rita Tower.
This is the truth: The Internal Affairs Service for the SBMA told the official report that there was a man who was with the legal department of DBM and PM 8 but he did not do anything.
Why is it that maybe, maybe, he goes after being shot by the distransaction, isn't it?
It is clear that the interest of the SBMA and the people in the transaction will not be watched, that's why when it's likely that it is going to make money and make a sigh of nonsense on the gate of the Subic Film Festival.
"As said," a tip of the Philippine administration of the SBMA the reason why President Aquino is serious, and if President Aquino is serious in his straight path, he will take action to turn his children to sleep in their own reasons.
