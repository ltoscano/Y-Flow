Stop the priest.

Because he did not experience a family, especially his father, that's why they are just going to oppose the Reproductive health bill by a few priests.
This is the fear that Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago was shouting.
Yes, if there are still some who are opposing against the RH bill, what is being felt by a father every time his son is crying and has no choice even to buy coffee and pandesal!
If they just know the feelings of a father every time she sees her daughter, with a prosperous clothes, and keeps playing with children with beautiful clothes!
If they just know that this feeling is a sample of, they should just let each parents need their own families!
The priest answered, we are feeling that because we will mingle with them everyday.
Aha, is that so, Father?
Isn't it that you also know the feelings of a husband while your husband is bathing at the early morning and crying because he has many debt of debt?
You are bad, Father, and that is what you feel, the woman who is crying because of your debt or a woman who has a pillow in your arms at dawn?
