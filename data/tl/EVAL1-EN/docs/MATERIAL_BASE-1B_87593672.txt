Tanong, unable to answer.

Tanong, unable to answer.

"How will this happen, when I am a single woman?"

This is the question of Maria, the question that's bothering her mind.

Perhaps, in the mind of Maria, there are still a lot of connected to those questions like me, "when I gave birth to my child, do you give birth to my child, and when I got married, that is against the law of the Jews, will you defend me?"

The questions, that can't answer the questions that's bothering her feelings, and for his worry, she is only doing all of his statements, "I am telling all his statements," I am saying that what you said will happen to me. "

In our life, like Maria, we have a lot of questions that we cannot answer the questions like... there is a failure?

Why would the problem come together?

Why is there sadness?

Why is there poverty?

Why are there calamity?

Why did the RH bill pass?

Why was I removed from work?

Why is there death?

Why are there so many things that can be killed?

And why is it that time?

We have a lot of questions, we cannot answer the questions that are bothering our faith and for our worry, let us imitate Maria: IOS in our God for us to increase our failure.

Let us passing the poverty of our lives.

We will vote our problems.

Let us travel to our sadness when we pass our illness.

Let us vote all of our lives?
