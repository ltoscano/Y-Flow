You are free!

You are free!

(Jugo, 8: 31, 42 years old.

Are you free?

All of us want us to be free from But-Times was what he is saying, freedom is being said to do whatever he wants, but instead, he is becoming a slave, and instead he is becoming a slave to his own desire.

While others have a free meaning of being free, that is why there are many people who take care of all sorts of things.

"Jesus:" The whole will set you free, "the truth will free you the truth, that is why if we follow this, we are becoming free.

We are looking for the freedom of self from many things.

Wealth is fame.

Do you want to be free?
