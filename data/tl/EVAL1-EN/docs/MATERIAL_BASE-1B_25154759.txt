Manila, Philippines - President Aquino should not resign from his position in the midst of the increasing call of some archbishop of the Catholic Church and the militant group that he went down from the power caused by the Mamasapano massacre at the "Fallen 44."
According to AFP Chief of Staff General Gregorio Pio Catapang Junior, President Aquino has a mandate to lead the country because the people voted for it.
Catapang also said that there is just a gossip or scandal that there is a direct coup with PNoy.
"We still have not received any report there, we was able to stop this," said the AFP Chief.
Among those calling the resignation of PNoy is Zamboanga Archbishop Romulo dela Cruz, who has been said to be an expert "or a low leader of PNoy.
"

As a reaction, Catapang also said that it is just right to wait for the term of President Aquino in 2016.
Catapang also emphasized that there is no need for a loyalty check with the troops of the military because the soldiers are following him and to be able to attend to the office of Command.
A resounding issue about the downfall of the leadership of the government due to the Mamasapano massacre because it is possible to have a mutiny.
Earlier, Malaca√±ang insisted that President Aquino will finish his term and he will not resign from his duty.
