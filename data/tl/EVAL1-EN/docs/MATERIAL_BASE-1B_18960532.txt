Divisoria is a vendors in Divisoria.

The vendors in Divisoria are said to be crying because of the huge amount that they will go and be taken from the Manila City Hall and Manila Police District (MPD).
Particularly our talking, vendor, alias Rey Baba, and one alias Manhhh.
Identified as alias Rey Baba, a retired policeman, was allegedly did by the Mayor's complaint against the Manila City Hall, which is headed by former Police Col. Franklin Gacing and assigned to Dagupan Block 2 of Manila Police District (MPD) and was allegedly did by PS-2 Commander Col. Erry Ortega.
According to vendors, it is allegedly cruel and bloody to collect the two victims, alias Rey Baba and Mananghmm, because if you are not in giving out, you will surely be caught and they would steal your merchandise and sometimes they are thrown away by them.
The two are not embarrassed, their bodies will get stronger but they depend on other people, the nerve of their faces, so these two can't be afraid?
Can these two seem to bear to feed their family the money that other people worked hard for?
Could it be said that the vendors did not think that it would be a trend now, which is why it is possible that their karma will reach you, hopefully it is only for you that the karma will hit you, not in your family.
Everyday, Baba is asking for a reminder to the vendors for the birthday of whoever Juan dela Cruz, except for every day and weekly kickbacks.
Does Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim and Ret. Col. Franklin Gacosta are being done by alias Rey Baba?
I was just asking.
Is it possible that he thought of alias Baba, what he is doing is a huge weakness and loss of Mayor Lim this 2013 election?
You, remember, think of it, your opponent is strong, we might be impatient in the slums.
Just except if you have bought your own representative, a machine.
