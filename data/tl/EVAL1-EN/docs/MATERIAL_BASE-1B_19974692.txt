DOLE Sec. Baldoms also warned.

It looks like Labor Health Organization (Ro-Ro-Ro-Ro-Ro-Ro-Ro-Ro-Ro) is determined to clean from the different kinds of corruption in his department, we are impressed by Secretary Baldomz because even though other departments have not yet been widespread in corruption, like other departments, it is still decided to make it free.
Just recently, Sec. Balarz launched a campaign for the graft case that he is calling the corruption of DOLE and some companies where he challenged all kinds of corruption in his office where he challenged all sectors that will join him so that he would become old or worse in the straight path. "
He also boasted to be strong by the National Trianglement that he is going to accept the complaints that the public wants to receive from his office so as early as it looks like Sec. Balentz seems to clean the DOLE and I salute him there.
What is admirable is, since he already has a campaign against him, maybe it is better for him to see some of his personnel around him because what happened to the case of a friend is being used.
It's because the friend of my friend wants to stroll together with some foreign workers in order to build a training center who wants to work in another country.
What hurts is that there was a person who insisted that he had a contact with Sec. Baldomz and was asked for permission from Secretary Baldomz, because of the size of the requested increase, that was why I brought his rights to Director Nicon Famnesty.
Director Non that's why we found out that the papers of my friend is not running, and it is not true that such a large amount is needed to give him a huge amount to give him up to Secretary Baldomz and using his name in nonsense.
I am thankful for an unknown behavior from his quick action that is why these crooks will not succeed in that incident, but hopefully, he should also be a warning to the people around him so that he would be successful in his campaign against corruption.
