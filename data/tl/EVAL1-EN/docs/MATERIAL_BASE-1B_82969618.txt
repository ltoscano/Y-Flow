As the students of UP, maybe it is just normal for us, the words that should be imposed on us since we called Isko or religious scholar of the country, this is a way to bring back the support of our country.
But what should we do to say that we are serving the public? This is usually an answer that this might not be given to the rally, but it is better that this will add to the number of those who will attend, but will it be acceptable for the number of those who will attend, but will it be given to the number of unity for the same goal?
I have seen a list so that people who do not forget to do while studying in a university are following, I still support this in a gathering, but when we think about it, it is not just what we are forgetting, not only in this way of serving the country.
The most important is the meddling of the issues happening in the country, if there is nothing, nothing will happen to those who know and fight for all the sides of an issue, from this, your knowledge will increase in things and create their own stand in the said issues.
After having your own belief about a situation, you can say this is your part of your friends, you can't be able to know the issues of your friends, you can't be sure that you can help in this part and there is also a lot of people who arrived here.
After all, you will come today to a decision, if you are ready to get one of the steps in order to improve oneself and help in the country, there are more people who can reach you, and further strengthen your own knowledge about the issues because you are surrounded by people who are similar to belief.
It is also not bad to choose to stay on the side if you want your stay in a university or maybe you do not believe in the way that we have left, that is why it would be better for us to unite in helping not only for the progress of our countrymen, but also for the progress of our country?
