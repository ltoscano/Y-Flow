Don't be swayed by Binay (3).

It is impossible for Vice President Jojo Binay to be far from the little bit of Vice President Rodrigo Duterte.
What I wonder about is why, if Duterte acts, he is the best leader of the Philippines' skin.
Shameless, and then.
And when he acts, it seems that he is the most clean in the whole world.
But boss, can you explain the connection of your family in the holiday in Davao?
"We are asking about this, because I heard, a business partner was being caught in case against him that he is attacking?
And how can there be a lot of Korean survey that is being done in Davao?
It is also good to ask where and how it was wasted by Duterte for P430 million intelligence fund of his office.
With the size of this fund, the NPA should not rule the district of district.
Even though we know that Duterte is unlikely to win in any position outside the Davao, it is saddening that he will be caught by a person who also believes in his ability.
This is a model of a big mistake when it comes to our decision making what is right for the country.
