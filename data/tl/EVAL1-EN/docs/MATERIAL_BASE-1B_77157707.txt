Wow, there are a lot of high buildings for almost all building around and what will improve, I am thinking that it can be eaten by them?

Do you have thought that most of the subdivisions and trevaded of the residential units and building are from the former rice field and places that can be bought and change their faces and eat too much buildings, which is why it is delicious there?

I remember that it is a saying that people will just know that he cannot eat money if all of them do not have anything to eat in our country where they want to rise from poverty and work in the farm because it is supposedly poverty.
