I talked to the TIDs.

Not humane!
"That is just one of the words uttered by the former First Lady Imelda Marcos when he visited the wake, I mean, in the hospital where former President GMA was imprisoned (hospital arrest).
That's why Imeldiologists immediately reminded PNoy that GMA will be allowed to take medication for other countries because his condition is pitiful!
As a matter of fact, the Imdiets for PNoy was made as an example how former President Ferdinand Marcos allowed America to have a treatment in America (father of PNoy) when he was bedridden in the heart disease!
In truth, we agree that GMA has a treatment in another country.
It is not the reason that he is the former president of the Philippines or maybe for the reason why he is not yet arrested for the cases he is facing.
But for the sake of the person who is calling it based on humanitarian consideration, "
And in the political condition of the country, because if GMA died that he is not allowed to take medication for other countries, it is certain that he will start all over the left campaign against PNoy!
But if the past will come back, if I am GMA, I will not allow to be treated in another country.
Even if PNoy did not agree or the Sandiganbayan.
Why is it that because his proposal is Imelda Marcos!
While in the hospital (Philippine Heart Center), because Ninoy was still in the hospital, Imelda was also going to have a proposal to be treated in America.
Yes, since Ninoy got healed, but what happened to the Philippines?
Removed after being removed!
GMA is now in the hospital now and Imelda also has the proposal to be treated in another country?
Gross! When he returned to the Philippines, he knows!
If I am GMA, I will just answer what Imelda was.
I am sorry!
