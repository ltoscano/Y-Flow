The help of US Navy with the time of disaster.

The flood wiped the flood this Monday in the history of the city of Olongapo.
This is the truth: Almost every year in the past ten years, there was a flooding in Olongapo and many thought there would be no more worsen in the flood last year.
It is just a southwest monsoon, not a storm, from the raging river in the city of Olongapo, together with the towns of Subic, South Marcelino and San Marcelino in the southern part of the province of Zambales where there are landslide which were confirmed dead by not less than 24 people.
This is the truth: It is clear that the southwest monsoon is clearly seen even worse than the storm.
Many places in the past were submerged in flood and in the previous flooded, water increased and a tall person is higher.
The rescue fund which is being ran hurriedly "in Olongapo which is full supported by military units of Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority) despite this, a number of places affected and lack of things are still lacking, which is why other people are not close to it.
Here in the memory of many "old Balara, the US Navy, who were from Olongapo and nearby places, also based on Subic Bay, this is true: Because there are ships of the US which cannot anchor in Subic, in the minds of many that they might help them.
But because of the current set up under the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), where their presence was limited, the US Navy cannot move without the blessing of US Embassy in Manila, aside from the time that the US Embassy in Manila is limited, besides that the disaster has happened.
The Philippines can be brought with the negotiation with the increase of the US Military Academy at the country to ensure that even if the US Navy and marines are going to help in the embassy, they will help each other while they visit them.
