Long live you all!

Until now, CNN News does not stop in their almost 24 hours about the tragedy that they reached for almost 24 hours of helping the victims of typhoon Yolanda.
Thank you very much, CNN, thank you very much to the United Nations.
We are calling on G. Benigno Simeon Aquino III (Bo 3), I hope that this call is the AFP-PNP Engineering Brigade because no matter how many want to help and send their help, they will not have a lot from the barbells, streets and streets.
Just let each branch of the DPWH bring back their big machinery to remove the huge trees and stones that can be built on each road, and we should not share stories about the affected areas of calamity, Mister President.
And hopefully, in the moment the places are clean, get ahead of having a good plan to build the houses but this time you should control the system.
I am sure that the ararchitect of the country is ready to help and fix the houses in every community so that the flow of the whole life will be fast and orderly, under the State of National calamity, the purpose is the order.
It's not bad to act like a beggar in front of many leaders of the country, you can ask for help from them on the issue of housing and equipment, it is not wrong especially the funds for the housing and life that is why you need to be honest to your call.
I believe, they will listen to them, to the rich people, to provide aid to the victims of our countrymen who are not led by Noynoy, my belief that it will be resolved in order to fix it properly. "
You can do that if you want you to be humble in front of the world, do not let your urine prevail in front of our country, and do not let your urine prevail on this time to our citizens who are increasing and helping, live!
