Real culprit.

Severe flood has been experienced in many areas in Metro Manila this past few days.
The cause is the "southwest monsoon"
Before this, the number of dengue increased the number of dengue-being pointed as the cause of the mosquitoes.
Just recently, when the disease has been broken, "the reason, the reason is urinating on the stubborn rats.
When the poor are hungry, the reason is the lack of work.
When the carnapping were widespread, syndicates and thieves are blamed.
We are pitiful, to collect it, because the government thinks that all of us have something for us!
Southwest monsoon is also a southwest monsoon which is also like leptospirosis with the urine of rats and dengue caused by the bite of mosquitoes.
We admit that, as a crush, just like the hunger brought by poverty and crimes like the carnapping incidents of the syndicate.
But our question is, why did we not prepare for our government?
It is easy to make the southwest monsoon in the flood, the mosquitoes with dengue, a rat is having leptospirosis, lack of jobs in poverty and syndicates in crimes.
But the truth is, the real culprit in these are the failure of the government or failure to conduct a good project!
Does it still need to say that this is because of corruption?
