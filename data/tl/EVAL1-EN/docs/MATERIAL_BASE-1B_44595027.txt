Umm.

Umm.

(Mt. 8: 1-4)

Are you too sensitive?

The word coming in the time of Jesus is a generic medicine for all, a person or a person who has a mental illness, maybe because you have a sin that he has a mistake or maybe the family has a fault on this year.

And this illness has a pity that is why there is an illness that is being driven away from the town, they are not being driven away from other people who have no disease, they are not only able to approach them because they will be allowed to approach them because they will be allowed to approach them because they will be allowed to come to it.

But Jesus arrived, she was not able to go near and touched by Jesus.

Jesus will hit the existing system of treatment to those who are taking advantage if the people are being driven by the small, Jesus Christ, the people who are at the bottom of the bottom, Jesus Christ, his mother-afting in their real value as a child of God.

It is easy to love the handsome grandchildren and beautiful things that can easily accept the rich and powerful and with title in society.

But it is hard to love these, those who have faults, the poor, those who are in the bottom of society, are the ones who are in the bottom of the society, the ones that we have considered.

Let us imitate Jesus.

Jesus saw the beauty of her will when we love them and accept it.
