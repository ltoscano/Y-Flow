A heart, NEDA: Price of goods increase in Power, oil.

The truth is clear now when the price of electricity and petroleum will increase, the price of all goods will also increase.
The National Statistics Office and the National Football Development Authority) is saying that all goods these past months have been loved because of the very expensive diesel, gasoline, Livni and gas.
The price increase was also big because of Meralco's price increase.
Of course, the price of goods in places destructed by calamity, especially typhoon Yolanda, is different.
The "national calamity has failed" to control the love of all goods in the calamity area.
What is painful here is that, everyone is hit because rice is expensive, only sea, fruits, vegetables, oil, and others.
Also because of the incident, the high price of goods will surely last long while the price of petroleum and electricity will also last for long.
Before, the government does not accept, especially Malaca√±ang, the bad effects on the price of goods is the increase in price of goods.
And if it is not accepted, the people are the ones who hit him with saying that they should save once.
There is a sign that the government has a taste like that.
The price of the price will also be felt, especially the rice, because rice is supposedly cheap in the countries Thailand, Vietnam and India that we are talking about.
These kinds of rice are supposedly too much in these countries which will push through the price of rice.
Let's just ask, our government, what is in the government, what should you do with the causes of the price of the price of all basic goods in the Philippines?
Are you just going to just let the abuse of the oil companies and electricity that we have burns, and depend on the foreigners to our stomach and other daily lives?
We was we.
