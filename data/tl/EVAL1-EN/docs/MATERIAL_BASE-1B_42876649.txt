There is a experience in Leyte and in the Senate.

Because there is no help coming from the government a few days after the storm surge of Leyte and in the neighboring provinces, those who were devastated by some department store and they have already attacked each of their things that they can heal.
The people of the government called him "lot of clothes" or in the Tagalog words.
The government warned and after a while, he was already asking the curfew to stop this corruption.
Few days have passed and there is still no help coming from the government, local or national.
Those from Visayas are not just hungry but are weak from food, water, milk and many things.
All of the people in Visayas were pounce on the refrigerator, TV set, bed sheet, a turmeric tea, hammer, shoes, clothes and others.
The excuse of the government is that they are having a hard time going through relief goods because they lack the household help and vehicles that will bring bad luck.
However, the government said that this is not a reason for clothes.
To those who were devastated, to those who almost died from lack of food and houses, they cannot see any reason for the closed store to not open.
Just how much are the victims of typhoon Yolanda and the next storm surge?
Did they reach one million pesos for what they stole?
It didn't even reach the number of clothes that happened at the P10 billion pork barrel scam which is connected to Janet Napoles and congressmen, Senators, government officials and other stuff.
Where are the donations, money or money?
Let us just wait for you, the government said that is why this is done by those who are thirsty for government?
