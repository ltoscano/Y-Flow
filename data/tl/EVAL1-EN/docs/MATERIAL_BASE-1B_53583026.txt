I could have reservations with the traffic.

It will start the making of the skyway which will be connected to South and North Cemetery to start the order to repair EDSA in Pasay, Caloocan.
But the plan on how the students and passengers will not be affected is only now being discussed.
Those who are leading the government of President Noynoy are smart, and I can assure that our president is more intelligent.
I cannot understand what kind of intelligence is the urging of our President to build the construction and construction of the skyway and EDSA.
The intelligent people when our government want to start is only four days to study the students of Metro Manila to lessen the traffic.
There is also one that can go crazy.
According to him the schools outside Metro Manila are going to be transferred to the constricted streets.
There are also those who say that employees are going to work for four times a week for the reason that this will help as a traffic in our city.
If these are intelligent people, they should be able to study well before the construction of a long skyway across between EDSA will be started before starting EDSA.
If ever these cases will prevail, what can we be experienced in, and make sure that the trip of the two road will prevail?
Of course, traffic is still traffic under the new skyway southbound, aside from the Holy Week, it seems that the ticket he bought from the skyway southbound.
Of course, the traffic would be more strengthened especially since they are going to destroy the schools that will be transferred outside of Metro Manila.
And even the entry of students only lasted for four times a week.
Why is it that the government should not pay attention to a thrifty person, similar to arresting colorum and those who have been noted public utility vehicles that are everywhere in the streets?
