Thank you, you are asking you.
I am here in the school that we have to school; I am in school; I am in school, what you are doing there, I don't have anyone else.
They are asking you for a long time that we can see that we have been seeing each other for a long time; however, we have no text; we don't have a text message and I am not talking about it.
Let us see each other after a little bit, I miss you very much; I text me.
Yes, yes, before we go there, that is okay.
