Fighting in the price of electricity.

The Philippines now is the most expensive electricity in Asia and was intentional to be the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) which is now controlled by the group of Manny Pangilinan?
The Supreme Court (SC) temporarily stopped the additional amount of electricity according to the petition of its customer, but Meralco had a threat.
The warning of Meralco will be there by brownout and blackout because the company of Mister Pangilinan will not be allowed to increase the price of electricity.
I don't want to think that this issue has a trace of politics.
I also do not want to think that the price of electricity will be removed from the destruction of President Noynoy Aquino.
The burial of Pres. Noynoy has a lot of reason for the many reasons why Noynoy has no political will and to the most favorable there.
Aside from those who are involved in corruption, Noynoy's people are involved in corruption.
The presidential election is now being focused on by many and this is a good opportunity in spiritual position.
If it is true that the leadership of the Liberal Party of Noynoy was ruined, it is easy to defeat the candidates of G. Aquino.
Before, there are those who suggested that Mister Pangilinan will run for the presidency of the country and this is again destroyed by others.
But this is known to Mister Manny Pangilinan.
Mister this is a businessman and it is only natural for him to take care of his personal interest.
Aside from Meralco, he was also hit by many newspapers, including his Channel 5.
Meralco is a private companies but it is also a public utility vehicles.
It is the responsibility of Meralco to take care of the interest of the country.
"That is if I am not mistaken.
There are even those who are asking why there was no public hearing that led the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (ERC) regarding power?
The chairman of the ERC is the political burial of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.
