Sometimes, you became a child.

Sometimes you have become a child (MK. 10: 13-16) whatever you are receiving the kids now, are you looking for the children's experience, they are rarely seen, they are not able to ask the children, that is why when they talk, they will go directly to the other ears.

In good news trends by the men of Jesus, they have thought that the children are very busy with the children because they have thought that the children are very busy with the children.

It is not important if they have a help or not, the age is not important, and what's important is that they are going to show the poor and those who are in power, the people who follow Christ said that the people who follow Christ said that the people who follow Christ said that this will not be accepted by the children.

Let us accept and help those in the bottom.
