That is why by Noynoy Stukenbrock?

Meralco looked for the country last Christmas when he expressed that the price of electricity will be increased again in a higher level.
For many, Meralco made a heinous statement that is why there are many groups who protested.
As time passes, the others said, President Noynoy Aquino has no idea of the horrible price increase in price of electricity.
The explanation of Meralco needs to be closed first to the Malhacan in Palawan because one pawnshop is needed.
Because of this, Meralco needs to buy a expensive electricity on his private athlete, which is why there was also someone following it.
The coer group reacted and went to the Supreme Court who has given a temporary restraining order against Meralco.
The Supreme Court would also like to know if Meralco had a coldness in Meralco and the power.
Noynoy has not have any reaction to someone who suggested to remove his post to remove the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) Chairman Zenaida Villania, former lawmaker and friend of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and his wife Mike.
In relation to this, Akbayan Partylist wants to remove Ducut because of his immediate investigation on the height of Meralco.
The complaint was presented to the Palace and Noynoy was forced to issue the suspension of the Supreme Court but the Palace said he has a long process of suspension for the advice of Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma.
"
Can Noynoy be removed from Ducut, like what he did to Merceditas Gutierrez, former Ombudsman, and to Chief Justice Renato, with the help of Bong Revilla, Manong Enrile, Jinggoy Estrada and other senators?
