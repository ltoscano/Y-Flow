Justice to Nora.

Roy Sebueres (Filipino Star Ngayon) - June 26, 2014 - 12: 00.

Why is it that the National artist Nora Aunor is not recognized as the National actor, because most of his fans are from a sheep, and probably they have children who are afraid to think that they will be chosen by Miss Aunor who is a National artist?
I was only a student in the '80s's when Miss Aunor is very glamorous.
Because I was studying in UST and San Beda College, I did not admit to anyone that I went to the public, but now that I was sentenced to the public, I asked to apologize to the public that I am going to apologize and to confront Miss Aunor as National artist.
Who was the copy of the National actor Circus, Ramon Santos, Jose Maria Zaragosa, Jose Maria Sharapova, they are not aware of the common things that they have done or what the filipino people do not know who are the ordinary people in the field of arts skill, Arts and the Culp Center of the Philippines and many others.
Yesterday, Mr. President, before you can think about it, there will be no effect on the form of culture and skill, straighten out the crooked and give justice to my idol.
