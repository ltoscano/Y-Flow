The government is crazy.

In PNoy's seat as President of the country, many believe that the situation of Mister Juan is going to have changes.
On the first day and next days, weeks, months and years, there are many changes that happened because of the anti-corruption coming from the Aquino administration.
One of those who served as "Tuwid na Daan" of President Noynoy Aquino will be defeated by Chief Justice Renato Corona.
There are still many programs and projects that had changes and that is what we feel - the whole country.
But the greater change they received are the increase in the state of the economy of the country, which was even released by big corporals.
Until the unexpected event, a Benhur Luy came out and revealed the anomaly that the lawmakers and leaders of the country are involved in which they will eventually become billions of funds of the country.
Some of the members of the Senate started because of the involvement of the P10 billion pork barrel that was being harassed by now that Janet Lim-Napoles was imprisoned.
Until the said pork scam exploded at the House of Rep, which was being implicated by many more congressmen.
From the issue of PDAF, the anomalies related to the billions of funds of the government which is the center of the debate where the said funds are.
With the number of information that happened, which is a billion fund of the country, the people have been talking to, so the citizens were taken care of.
Do we think, that, the government is disturbing us because instead of being a project for Mister Juan, the dialogue will be discussed, the ones who are doing the nonsense.
What is happening to the Philippines?
