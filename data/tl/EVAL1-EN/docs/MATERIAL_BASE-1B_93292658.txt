It is true that you are true.

The real patriot (Mt. 13-October. 23) you will strengthen your eyes to see and your ear when I have nothing to hear from my ears, I have no notice that it is difficult to hear from my ears.

I was prescribed some of my ears.

It was said that only part of the doctor was to clean, the doctor was placed inside the Lord to protect your ear and since then I was not cleaning my ear when it was just outside.

We are lucky that our hearing will be clear, but Jesus said that they are lucky to see the people who have been with them for a long time so that they can see the words of Christ for a long time so that they can see each other in the relationship with Jesus.

Jesus: "It is better to listen to the words of God and follow it, it is clear that your eyes are lucky, you are lucky! Your ear, you are lucky! You are fulfilling the words of Christ, you are lucky!
