Her stomach is sore: What do you do?

DOC WILLIE by Doctor Willie T.

All of us feel pain in the stomach, if we make food in your stomach, our stomach seems to have a headache, which is why our stomach seems to have a headache, which makes your stomach pain and if it gets worse, he might get distracted.
Not only medicine is the solution to the pain in the stomach, in my perspective, it is better to eat properly.
1's day to eat at the right time (LPA).
Eat little by little but often in one day, eat at 7: 00 in the morning.
2 becomes a banana and bread.
A banana is very lucky, aside from being alert and eating, banana is like a cure for our stomach, it is fine with our stomach, banana, and cholesterol which is why my money is very low.

3 - drink water little by little.
It is a big help of drinking softdrinks in the stomach so that the right drinking is a bit of water every 20 minutes on this way, the acid in the stomach will be washed and clean.
4 - avoid eating oily foods, avoid sour and spicy.
There are foods that are intentionally being broken into stomach pain and avoid too much food, corned beef, calamansi, vinegar, and dried coconut husk, too much cold and cough may cause headaches.
In my opinion, there is no need for medicines for an ordinary pain in the stomach, like banana, fish, rice, porridge, rice, porridge and vegetables, while eating so that our stomach will not be overcome!
