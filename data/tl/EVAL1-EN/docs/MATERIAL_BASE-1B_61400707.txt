Back to normal work.

There might be no hope for the flow of traffic at the National Capital Region especially in Makati, Quezon City and Manila.
This past night of Tuesday, a burden and like a traffic-like traffic was experienced by thousands of motorists in many main roads in NCR.
There was no typhoon but because of the sudden rains, the flow of traffic suddenly stopped so many passengers and motorists were stranded in the roads.
Most of them reached almost four hours of travel from Makati to Quezon City and will be able to go towards the southern part of NCR.
Meanwhile, the traffic is still being discussed, noticeable that the situation of traffic in Manila is noticeable.
How much the travel in the streets of the city has been relieved during the first days of the former President and now Mayor Erap Estrada and Vice Mayor Isko Moreno, he is tight in the traffic there.
Now, the former groups who are ruling of colorum and illegal terminals because their businesses are back to normal, their businesses are back to normal.
Meanwhile, Erap and Isko are still full of them because they think they only introduced themselves and released the price.
The jeepney driver did not care at the same time and take advantage of passenger buses like the corner of Taft and P. Faura, Taft and Pedro Gil Street, Taft Avenue, Avenida Rizal and many others.
The illegal terminals along Recto Avenue and Morayes Street, Nicanor Reyes and Espa√±a near PRC and many places are going back to it.
Aside from this, the buses and motorcycles don't care in getting along and riding a passenger anywhere.
Again the illegal terminal in Lawton, which I heard is being removed by the personnel of a barangay official there.
In other words, the heavy traffic in Manila is back to normal, just like before, like before, as well as the first who led to Manila, it is just a flyer from Erap and Isko.
My goodness!
We are really pitiful!
