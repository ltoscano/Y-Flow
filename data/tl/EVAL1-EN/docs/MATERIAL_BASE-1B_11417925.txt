Casimiro and a new product in Bicol By Jun Nardo, October 29, 2016, the six people from Bicol are not able to buy a corn, because they were also taught by the Department of Agriculture (DA) to plant casters or grand wood.
According to the DA-Bicol, they have started teaching the farmers to plant heavy wood or bark to the natives as an alternative livelihood when the field's condition is bad.
DA explained, that income will be bigger because there is no need for them to earn big and this is not necessary for this kind of crops to have been planted in places that have not been showered with rain or cheap.
