First, those who did not name the heroism of a person who did not name.
Of course, he is known by Nini, an active member of Ondoy in UP Integrated School, at the same age of Erlinda Ching, who is always ready to grieve and listen to other people, even if there is a good news, even if there is a good news, even if it is with a question: "And you?"
He remembered the novels the The Boko of Daniel Jr.
Nini, said that there are still many other than the outline of his way to the NPA, his real heart, Nini, had no bad bread for others, and he said that there were no bad bread for others, and according to her, they were able to go back to her, they went away, they went away and continued to visit them.
If there is a lot of change that's said by the theater, Walis.
That name is weird that, for those who met him, quiet, he cannot take a plate even if it is still hard for his duty to the NPA, but it is possible, but in his duty to the NPA, but it is possible, but in his life which is an inspiration to the continued fighting.
