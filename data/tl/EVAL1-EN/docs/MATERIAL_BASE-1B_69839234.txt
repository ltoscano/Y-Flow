Peace.

Peace.

(Lay-24-48).

All of us desire peace.

For others, peace is a lack of war or lack of fight and arguments, each other, the world is peaceful.

For Pope Paul VI, "development of the New name for peace." Who is going to be peaceful if people who have no peace and orderly houses for their families have no peace.

But whatever that we mean in peace, it will lead to a thing: There will be peace if we are in the presence of Jesus.

Let us see in good news trends by Jesus Christ, they are worried about what will happen to them.

The situation did not change because death is still lurking on them, but they had a peace of it, Jesus is there!

In our lives as well as if we do not have peace, we pray to Jesus, let us pray that there is no change in our home that there is still difficult in your house where your husband is still poor, that's why life is still difficult.

The attitude of your mother-in-law is still bad, but when you have changed, you have changed, you have changed.

Do you want to have peace?
