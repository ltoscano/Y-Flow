Heaven is not?

It seems that many of our countrymen can solve the poverty of many Filipinos, especially those who experience hardship and trials in life, especially in a financial aspect, many are dreaming of going to another country.
For them, this is like a door that will bring them a victory, but is it really true that this is the solution? Or maybe this is the only solution to think that it is possible to have a short or short way towards the success we are hoping for?
In Chicago, I met a Filipino who introduced herself as RJ before in my interview with her, she introduced me to the other faces of living in America, and just like the majority, she dreamed of getting more beautiful life there.
The family of RJ in the Philippines has a good life, in fact, they have a house helper, which is why he does not know how to go with each other in Chicago.
He never thought of the trials she was facing there.
"I did not study first, I am the one taking care of the children, I also need to work, to help his own house and vehicle, until he / she would think that she had his own house and vehicle, until he thought of building a business, a business partner.
At first, the business that he built is successful because he decided to resign from his work so that he would not expect that this will be the start of their downfall and fell down because of lack of fake things to live in making fake checks.
"All of the ways we did even if it is illegal, making fake check in computers, boal account, that it is the most effective crime that has been involved in America, but because of the desire to change and with the help of his family, he slowly changed.
Many stories of success in other towns are what we hear, but there are just some who like RJ, who have the strength to admit their failure, but we can always remember that our success is still in our hands.
Hard work, perseverance and challenges, there are really poverty in it before they get out and finally recover.
