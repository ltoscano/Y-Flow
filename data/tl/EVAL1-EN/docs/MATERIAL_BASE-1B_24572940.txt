Jodi and Jolo, our meeting is often seen in BE. GROs) July 30, 2016.
Many are questions that this might just be the Break-up of Jodi Sta. Maria and Jolo Revilla.
It is figured out, that in the moment, Jodi is having a feast in the movie Aaahhmm, Hambil of Richard Yap and Ian Veneracion.
Now that the date of the movie is over, their meeting is over and there is a possibility of kissing a friend's picture to us with a picture of a group of wood which is part with Jolo and Jodi.
It seems like she has been rekindled by Jolo.
Most of those who attended were together with their husband, "others were their girlfriend, so our friend asked us if they have reconciled with Jolo and Jodi because they got involved in the picture of the people.
Jolo laughed when we asked him about that.
He said, his friends and most of them are his opponents in grade school where he brought Jodi.
It is possible that it just happened because he is not aware that their companion is in a picture.
They often see each other, but Jolo assured that they have not yet reconciled with Jodi.
Jolo just laughed when we asked his reaction to the doubt of the majority that he was just a Break-up, and then they got back together.
She said we saw how much sadness when she was Break, so they should not pay attention to it.
