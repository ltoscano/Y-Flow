Going to have lumps.

It was taken by President Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada to have grown up to those who are happening in Manila due to the collection of traffic, vendors, illegal gambling and houses entertainment now in any corner of the city.
With a famous name, it is said that there is a blessing from the morgue of a morgue have the collection of illegal drugs?
But the blame and anger of the people are Mayor Erap who is with the poor, Erap is the liver!
Is that correct?
It is a rumor that the Marzan couple is ill-tempered at the anger of Erap because Yorme is at a disadvantage with the two fair in the side of the City Hall at the Bonifacio Shrine and Remedios Circle.
Because the fair now is not enough, it is as if the condition of those who are fighting for their protectors, is the need to run out so even in the fair, they are able to pay?
On the other hand, we salute Mayor Erap to not allow Erap to let it be that he is the mayor and should be followed, let us not let it pass and be in power in the carabao.
They were so much suffering in Manila just to go and go to the provincial terminal because the buses are prohibited.
At first, it's as if the big buses in Manila suddenly became serious, the drivers, drivers and operators of buses but Mayor Erap, were not shaken by the bus ban in Manila!
But because of this, it seems that the bus and Taft Avenue are just like mushrooms.
Does this really know that it is Vice Mayor Isko?
According to vendors and pedicab drivers, the collection is still severe because they are angry at the mayor because they are being beaten-up.
Those who are a tough collector who are introducing themselves as members of the Office of the Vice Mayor. Some of them are assigned to the airports in Lawton, illegal terminal and the other group is assigned to illegal vendors and gambling.
Based on the nose of Erap, however, why did he not feel that he / she could not smell his stubbornness in the city of Manila, now he needs to have a helmet.
