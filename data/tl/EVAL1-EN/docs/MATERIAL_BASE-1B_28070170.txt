Labor Day!

Labor Day (Commission on Saint Joseph) has a kind of time for a class in a class since there is a lot of questions that they are working on, why are the farmers for their hard work or what they eat and what they eat and what they eat are the poor, and what they eat are the poor, and what they eat are the poor, and even if they get some of them, there are some of those who use them?

It was said that the gap between the poor and rich was started when the Industrial Revolution started when the two started between the two but for the inventor of the engines, many lost their jobs.

There are many workers who have been removed and replaced by a machine that would be easier to make it, and most of all, there are many people who are working hard for each other, but until now, there are many people who are working hard to work, but until now, there are many people who are working hard to work, but until now, there are many people who are working hard to work, but until now, it is possible that there will be a lot of additional wages for the country, but the right salary that is not based on the contract.

This is also what big companies are used to get workers, and because of the difficulty being accepted even just for a person including his family, we should take care of the laborers!
