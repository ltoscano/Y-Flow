Meow,: Floyd is the target.
Baba Perez July 31, 2016, there are only two candidates by Senator Manny Pacquiao who will fight against his last fight in November.
These are Ternal, Crawford and Jessie Vargas.
But Crawford or Vargas fight, seems that Pacquiao is just forced to face again because what he really wants to face is Floyd Mayweather Jr., but it seems that Mayweather still has no intention to return to now.
In a story that came out of Rolex, Mayweather allegedly said that since he retired, he has not yet taken out when they saw each other in a restaurant in Los Angeles.
However, Roach does not believe what Mayweather said to him.
For Roach if Pacquiao has two more left fight and he thinks that Mayweather has no idea of his return to the ring that he will wait for.
That is why the fight of Senator whatever is against Crawford or Vargas last November is like sweet words while he is waiting for Mayweather to change his mind.
Roach said in the interview of on the commission of the RX Boxing Organization, that Pacquiao really wants to take his rematch with Mayweather because he believes that he won the first meeting.
Roach once again insisted on what he said before that if he will remove the words of the commandos to be removed, it can be seen that Pacquiao's punches are more than Mayweather.

Roach even said that he / she was impressed by the performance of his favorite columnist but now, it's only 100 percent that would crush the Pambansang Kamao, Mayweather.
