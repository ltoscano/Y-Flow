LP creates a crisis in politics.

Butch Abad confirmed.

Manila, Philippines - United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) appealed yesterday to the leaders of the Liberal Party (LP) to stop the scenario which caused the crisis in the Constitution.
UNA Secretary General Toby Tiangco also appealed to the members of the Congress to dismiss any steps from the Aquino administration which may cause a crisis in politicians and put in trouble the institution of the government.
"This will only bear this kind of discussion about the term for-law, which aims to destroy the crisis in politics and will declare the Congress to approved the bill from the election in 2016," Tiangco said.
He expressed that the noise of the members of LP can be a failure to cover the hidden amount of election in the proposed 2015 national budget and will declare the Supreme Court to be generous to the wishes of the administration.
"There is one element of LP in order to do everything so that they will insist on what they are going to ask for the President to ask for a new term and continue the events as a way to ask for funds," Tiangco also stated.
According to Tiangco, the not equal position of press Sec. Sonny Coloma, Presidential spokesperson, Edwin Lacierda and Abigail Valte said about the term extension of President Aquino and the threat of impeachment against SC Chief Insp. Jovie Espenido, to show that there are some disagreements in LP.

"It is obvious that the spokesperson of the Palace, Lacierda and Valte are out of being out of the Constitution while these are open to the Constitution while these are not planning to have a plan to raise his administration and he will decrease in position in accordance with the Constitution," he added.
