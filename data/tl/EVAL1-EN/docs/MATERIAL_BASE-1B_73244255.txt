Jack.

If your father is beside you, it is hard for your father to take care of you but also the reputation of the name you are carrying.
Like me, sometimes you know that you are known as the child of your father even before you are really the name of your name.
Sometimes, look at you especially if your father is famous and made a bigger name.
Like Jack or Juan Ponce Enrile, Junior.
The size of the shoes that Jack will cook, as they say, is the father and the one who attacked him has no other than Johnny Enrile, or we know all of JPE.
But my question is, why is there a need to meet or why is there a need to be basis?
Of course, it is more careful especially if your father of JPE, but Jack can be famous and known as Jack first before the son of his father.
Jack is asking for a while.
Some of the proposed laws that he has written.
He focused on the widespread issues of agriculture, a proof that the classes of laws that are important for Jack will prove that as a lawmaker, Jack has the ability to give a voice to the real feelings and complaints of his constituents.
The same with Jack who is the child of their father is like a ball sometimes, you don't know where to go, if you're going to get the reputation of their name or to the person who is carrying it so he would not have a child.
Maybe the decision of Jack Enrile was not easy to run as senator because the name of JPE is not easy, but his courage to face the criticisms that he inherited from his father - resolve and facing the kind of eyes of the filipino masses.
The more intense research of Jack is that in case he becomes a senator, but he would also be proven that even if he is proud of his father, he / she is proud.
