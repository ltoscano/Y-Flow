New PhilHealth.

There is a big change in the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation or PhilHealth.
Their medical services will increase and the value of their rivals for members of the patient has increased, according to the spokesperson of PhilHealth, Del Amistoso, especially that they are the only ones who is expanding to be members of all Filipinos.
They want to give a certain financial help for every citizen, we have a law, all of us are members.
We advise everyone, first, take a member and know our benefits during the time of our needs for our health.
Atty. Alex Padilla as president and the chief executive officer of PhilHealth failed one more than the regime of President Benigno Aquino III.
We have not been talking to each other for a long time and I do not even talk to him when he is really busy with the agency of the government, now, in his new throne of PhilHealth, there is no doubt, many public service will be given to the agency.
For sure, he is the primary attention in the ranks of the poor, but it does not mean that he is far from those who are capable of defending us, "is one of the hot questions of PhilHealth," one of the hot questions in PhilHealth, "the Filipinos' answers were simple and respect the PhilHealth."
If possible, PhilHealth failed to build the country's hospital in the whole country, for sure, the results of their service will be better.
