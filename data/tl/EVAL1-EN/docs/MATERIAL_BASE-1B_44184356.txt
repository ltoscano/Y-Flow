Even though the house of the Philippines "is the meaning of Las Casas Philippines de Acuzar, it seems that there is only one owner of the antique house - Jose Acuzar, a famous architect, such a native architect, like Chope, which he bought for 500 pesos.
Places in Las Casas are aware of the growth of art of art of the country, every sign and structure used to the old houses, which is made of bamboo and leaves of the bamboo and leaves of the bamboo container, which is made up to the palm of the bamboo and leaves of the hut.
But it seems that the history made by Las Casas to his visitors are being paid for by some not good stories in the history of the Philippines, for example, the scenes experienced by the Filipinos in the hands of the guards on the hands of the guards on the hands of the Spaniards.
Aside from the history of history, the Las Casas well as a "Heritage Village" the idea made the history was formed and focused on by some famous personalities in however, the Las Casas is still being endorsed by the Las Casas because of its limitation on the feeling of Filipinos.

This is a proof that it is not only changed by Las Casas, the original owner of the houses that we need to increase, and because of this, Las Casas is considered a popular, and direct line of history.
It seems like what is showing in Las Casas to the Filipinos is the importance of our history and culture, it is part of the desire to earn a few hours or day to return to history, it seems that the culture of the few who have the ability to pay.
