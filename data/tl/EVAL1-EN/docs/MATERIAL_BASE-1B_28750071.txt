It is a very big joke.

Energy Secretary Jericho Petilla said that he is ready to resign if the electricity will not be restored in areas affected by typhoon and earthquake before Christmas day.
Brave words, especially the first statements, it will take six months to one year before the service of the electricity will be returned.
Admirable is the public funds that are like this, ready to gamble their names and reputation for their sworn duties in the country.
It was even said by Secretary Petilla, if they want to make his position as secretary of DOE, they will wait before Christmas, in his said deadline.
Many are really saddened when it was reported that the electricity in areas such as Samar, Leyte, Bohol, Iloilo, Iloilo and other places destructed by Yolanda and 7.2 severe intoxication.
The lawmakers and the public are asking the DOE of "why it has been long?"
What is really difficult with no electricity, you do not have electricity, there is no water in places that need electricity to earn water in the community.
"There are increasing eyebrows at the statement of Secretary Petilla -" if you did not fulfill his promise and resign, will it be accepted by PNoy?
There are some who have happened that a public was resigned because the President was not happy with its goal, but he did not accept the case.
Or it is possible that Petilla will bring back the electricity but in just a few places and not, in general.
How will you respond "like that, but even if there is still a lot of hope on the statement of Secretary Petilla.
Others are saying that the secretary will not show that if you are not sure, and to 50 percent, that can happen to his promise.
However, you don't want that to be embarrassed to the country, most of all, you don't want President Noynoy Aquino to be embarrassed.
Let us wait for the promise of Secretary Petilla.
After all, his name was very huge.
