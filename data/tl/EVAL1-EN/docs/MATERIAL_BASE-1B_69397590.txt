Wrong!

Sometimes, being a problem is always wrong.
It is wrong for things that instead of looking at what's good, the first thing they see is ugly.
An example is the criticisms against the ordinance which is being endorsed by Quezon City Police District 3 Councilor Allan Benedrial, who would be a big sister to the foul and offensive act as a comedy bar. "
The ordinance by Councilor Reyes is based on the complaint of some of our countrymen who sometimes are just too much the joke in the comedy bar.
Belle is a golden lesson and even sensitive issues like religion and disabilities are not even a little reaction if there is a little reaction.
Those who immediately opposed the proposed ordinance by Councilor Reyes said that this is just a way to free the councilor in the city.
The negative comments, if they do not want to go through a comedy bar, if you go to a comedy bar, you will notice that many foreigners would go to their Filipino host.
All the customers are witnesses as to how our fellow countrymen like the Philippines, the church, are women, parents, and especially those with disabilities, but sometimes it should not be and too much.
There are many reasons for a comedy bar because it is really happy in these kinds of places, but sometimes, the insults and no matter what kind of foolishness.
This is what the ordinance wants to be controlled by the ordinance, Councilor Reyes only wants to talk about the issue and can look at the issue or look at the public funds which can be fixed for the welfare of the majority.
Let us give a chance to Councilor Reyes, his mentality is not low to think bad for the QC.
For me, the councilor immediately blame the councilor who wants to earn this ordinance if it has been passed.
This is not the mentality of our elected councilor.
