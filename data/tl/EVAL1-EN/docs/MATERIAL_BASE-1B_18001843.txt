The attention of PNoy is on the 50-M CCTV scam of DBM.

Will he be charged with?
The Department of Budget and Management Council (DBM) supports the bidding of P56,M closed-circuit television (CCTV) project for the security and law Enforcement of Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA)?
This is the truth: DBM is said to be the opposite of this kind of transaction so the bidding on the project is not the SBMA.
But instead of being treated as a good and faster vice for the government, DBM and video machines are on the suspension of a company that he is throwing into contracts on the project even if they are not registered in the weather condition.
What's worse, the project that has not been waiting for now is not yet paid after the former administration of the SBMA through the DBM.
The CCTV in the law Enforcement Agency and security is important that is why it should be related to Subic Bay if they can be proud of.
But before the current SBMA hold-up to whom the new contract will go, if ever, the P58,000 pesos scam of DBM will be given a case to file a case against the case to be charged.
Let us see if President Noynoy Aquino will do something, or maybe those involved in him, relatives or friends are also strong.

Many businessmen in Baguio City are smiling at the entry of there.
1.2-M local and foreign tourist there during Christmas season.
But the heavy traffic in the streets, line at the restaurant and crowded where are some of the reasons why there is a few reasons why there is something to return to the "City of Pines" never.
This is the truth: Baguio is good and what is needed is to fix the facilities and infrastructure not only in the city but also for hundreds of going to and from different parts of Luzon.
