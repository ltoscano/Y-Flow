It is very hot now but it should not be forgotten that the rainy season will not be forgotten.
This is the truth: In the Philippines, that only have two children, which is why he sits on the table, or can find out different kinds of problems or disaster brought by the time.
It is also the experience of the one who taught us that during the rainy season, it is better to have a fire, to houses, businesses and even in the forest.
There are also diseases that are scattered all over the rainy season like chicken cox, Mead, Mumps (MMFF), sore eyes and vitality.
But in the city of Olongapo and the town of Subic, it is now feared that flooding is now feared due to the rainy season.
That is why Olongapo Mayor Roland C. Mesias, in implementing the rivers, together with its mouth in Subic Bay because it was really severe, "they have become too much."
