Drilon, resign!

Franklin Drilon should resign.
This is what Mang Frank Drilon should do because he could not do anything for his work especially in investigation and discovered the truth.
Aside from the hindrance to search for justice for the results of the pork barrel of the lawmakers, he is becoming a burden to the government because he does not want to discover where the people's money went to.
It is clear that the judicial system like the Ombudsman and the Congress is clear so the people believe that Drilon is being done by Drilon.
In the name of searching for the truth to make an appropriate law that will prevent it and it won't be repeated for the abuse of PDAF or pork barrel, the purpose of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee is clear so it is clear that Senator Chiz Escudero and TG Guingona have a point.
Hearing aid (WHO) is the point of Caibiran and Chiz to be called by Janet Lim-Napoles but because in the burial of Janet Lim-Napoles, he is now facing a useless situation because the people caught him that he is the one to protect the subpoena of the so-called pork barrel queen of the country.
Because what is serious about this is that Drilon knows that Drilon will not be complacent about his decisions just because he has used the word "in exchange of oath ation" if he wants and favor his goal, and will fight.

It seems that it is better to remove Laguna Governor ER Ejercito from his position?
There is a strong evidence presented by the Comelec by his opponent, Egay San Luis.
It is also clear that the current administration is focused on the current administration which is why the case of ER did it a priority.
That's why the suspicion of the PNoy administration will crush the clan of Erap.
