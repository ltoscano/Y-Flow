Many are asking Port Area if Commissioner Ruffy Biazon will still be the boss of the Bureau of Customs?
This is the talk of all players and personnel of BOC because it is clear in their observation that all new deputy commissioners of Malacanang are all personnel or allies of Finance Secretary Cezar Purisima.
It is also clear in BOC that Biazon will not have its wing because four new Depcom Ariel Chua and Maria Ediqui, all classes or chicken of former Customs, Angelito Alvarez and the businessman named Bert Lina, are all classes or chicken.
It's because the news from Adelana, who is Purisima, Lina, and Alvarez are the ones who have control now because aside from the four new Depcom and them allegedly, the boss of Finance Department of all the department of the BOC.
In a short word, many say that the Palace seems to be able to go back on the incident because he did not make questionable policies on the day of Adelana, he has returned to his position and it hurts, Malacanang has permission.
Even the press who is said to be brought out by the BoC is still needed to pass through the office of Purisima and that is what makes everyone knows.
It cannot be avoided for the news of the news that the members of Ht-10 which included Purisima, Budget Sec. Butch Abad, who are included in DAP and PDAF and Dinky Soliman, will have a strong strength for the son of Tita Cory.
Is that the situation of Biazon in Asukal will be like that, because it is just all people that he will give in, but as a leader of the said agency, it is just proper that he is controlled by his jurisdiction.
