"When will you go home to Saturday, he / she said yes, what you say yes," you should talk to your mother, right yes, okay, right, Saturday, and very pitiful.
Saturday, you might say that when I go to school, you said that you should leave me alone.

That is all.
You know that we are very pitiful; we are stupid; isn't it or anything that we can see in Quirino; I will just wait at the Quirino Grandstand, wait for you to hear, mother.
Okay.
