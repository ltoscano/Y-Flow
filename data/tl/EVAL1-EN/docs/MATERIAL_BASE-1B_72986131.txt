Independence Day.

119th Independence Day (Mt. 5: 17-19) Independence Day, but what is the real meaning of freedom?

What we celebrated is the release of the country from the long time of the Spanish colonizers.

In my opinion you have not yet free.

If you will look up with a bigger perspective, there are still things that the Philippines will want to get the wealth of the Philippines as an example, which is the issue of mining companies and selling products from the agricultural sector, avarming, etcetera.

For example the children and students, they are thinking that they are not free when they come home when they come home when they are not studying in the corner, they say that they are going to go to school when they do not want to enter other people and what they want is to commit suicide, what is the real meaning of freedom?

In good news trends by Jesus: "Do not expect that he lost his own happiness, the law that they have done to God is not free, to follow the law of God, to follow the law of God, to follow the law of God, to follow the law of God, to follow the law of God.
