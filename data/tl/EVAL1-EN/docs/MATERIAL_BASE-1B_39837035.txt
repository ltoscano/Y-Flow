Ombudsman is lacking in lawyer.

It is Gemma Garcia.

Manila, Philippines - Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales confirmed that they are having a hard time to meet the lack of lawyers in the country.
This is also one of the reasons why the campaign rate in the Philippines is slow and low compared to Indonesia which is around 70 percent and in Hong Kong, 90 percent.
Morales said that if the Congress can lessen the funds of the Office of the Ombudsman compared to the proposed budget of 1.73 million for the 2015, it is certain that the lack of personnel and those who make sure that it will increase in the country will also increase.
He also admitted that one of the reasons of the slow Recruitment and lawyers were also paid because it needs three years in service before getting a lawyer position to the Ombudsman.
Aside from this, they are stricter in Recruitment and Gaming Corporation so that they can make sure that they are being possessed by an alleged lawyer based on what they are paying.
Currently, 363 lawyers have 363 lawyers and will need 360 lawyers so that all cases being served here are going to be quickly addressed.
