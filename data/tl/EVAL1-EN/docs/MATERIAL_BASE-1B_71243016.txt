In case it would be removed by PNoy and all of these.

Many are asking us, the customers of the Ipit Gang "about our statements that the action is needed in order to oust the entire regime of Benigno Simeon Cojuangco Aquino III (Bira 3) who will be transferred to him immediately after they protest against VP Jojo Binay.
At first, we supported Baba 3 as a leader of the country, but just from the beginning of his leadership, he was found to have a unique leadership, which is contrary to everyone and we saw at the end that he is going to go to hell!
The wrong rules in his leadership are already piled up, how much is his anger from corruption in the previous administration, the COA said that more than 300 percent corruption are happening now, if it will rise up compared with the previous administration of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, now, the difference is far.
The difference is far from the fact that the people of PNoy are far from the case of GMA, it is true that it has a huge amount, but it has happened within the nine-3 billion dollars, including the pork barrel and DAP), and this is what happened to his all wrong and corrupt staff, he should be fired from Malaca√±ang!
Here is it, if the people can prove it, this is just a suggestion.
The Senior Council of Leader's troops were able to form out from different parts of the society, including representatives from the ranks of the military and the national police who will conduct a national program in the province, along with the local leaders in the province, city and town.
The SL) will call on our Saligang Batas from all sectors, richest to the poorest people, but for all.
It may last for more than a year that the process to build the SCL but it can also be quick, depends on their performance.
The leaders of the country will form a contest of joining the current politicians from joining.
There is no impact of pork or DAP that there is no commission of a drinking session.
Is that possible?
