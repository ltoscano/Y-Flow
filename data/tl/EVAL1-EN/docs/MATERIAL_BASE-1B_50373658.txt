Dick went into a peek at.

As the time of some corrupt employees in Quezon City Hall.
This was sent to us by some close to Quezon City Mayor Herbert "Bistek" Bautista which is almost sure.
His second term because of the serious opponent.
According to the payment, Bistek was very thankful to those from Quezon City, more than big politicians here because of his trust in them again.
Because of that, he is set to give said trust to him, so he promised to clean the reported officials and employees.
A source of payment, Mayor Bistek was scheduled to take a peek at the complaints against the alleged corruption of Trisha Mostoles.
The truth is, make a lot of complaints that we have received from the alleged any various speculations that are happening there in the office of Villanueva.
That's why it's just right that Mayor Bautista should take a peek at it and if it is proven that he will be sent away immediately!
