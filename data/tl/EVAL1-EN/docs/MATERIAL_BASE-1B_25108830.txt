A liar and a thief.

President Noynoy Aquino defended himself in front of the controversy on pork barrel.
He insisted that he was not stole and never was a thief until he was in position.
The critics said, there are no thieves who are accusing PNoy.
PNoy is said to be guilty in his continue being clean.
PNoy discovered in relation to the amount of millions of money from senators and congressmen from the Disbursement Acceleration Program.
The funds from DAP, "the government agencies have said that the government agencies have been able to spend in order to spend on the projects and improvement of the economy, it was made up with other politicians to accommodate his way of time.
Many are saying that the attitude of President Aquino is scary to be "Mr. Clean" even if he knows that the pictures and robbery in his yard is widespread.
The truth is, PNoy is confusing.
He always change the discussion.
He does not have his own posture on the issue of pork barrel but he was even caught lying about DAP.
The majority of the citizens want to remove the pork barrel which is the cause of widespread stealing in the funds.
Many call here.
He would pretend to be in favor of the removal of pork barrel, but not the DAP, and his own funds.
The President is also different from the money.
Let us expect that corruption in the funds will continue.
The controversial "pork barrel" of the lawmakers are still swaying, which is why many people will fight again.
We are lucky if there are those who are senators and congressmen who will not look into their pork.
But because of their strong face, it is unlikely to happen.
They are still together with a liar and thieves.
"Are we not doing something," the liar is the sibling of the thief. "
PNoy is not a thief.
He is a liar!
