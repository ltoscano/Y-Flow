In short, the members of the mentioned departments have been dismissed again as the secretary of the said department.
The word "krrrik," krrrik, "I first heard from the heart of one of my friends who did not last long because the said patient died because of her Toyota Hilux.
Now I thought, it was very good to Secretary de Lima and Soliman.
Wow, it is said that lepers were passed before, but still alive!
Meanwhile, the father of my friend, who died immediately, was just passed away!
That's why, when I realized from my friend that the secretary of DSWD and DOJ is still strong, even if I was passed, he immediately opposed, e Tangere, which is not possible!
To my knowledge, those with my heart have passed, why two of them were passed, but, there were no hearts?
Ehek! In reality, if it is just a little thinking, if they are just a little thinking, they just parked them with a little shame that they're just going to buy a little shame.
It's been three times that you have been driven by the CA!
