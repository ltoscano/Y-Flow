However, the Philippines is standing in the whole world because of the grave illness of many devotees and those who were able to join their backs that is why the Lord Jesus' Cristo is going to suffer, they are not killed and live again like what the Lord did.
This unexpected event is one of the tourist spots in the country during the Holy Week-Only in the Philippines.
The devotees believe that they will get rid of their mistakes if one will have a hard time to have a hard time for everyone to believe what they want to believe.
But there are others who are after the penitential feast, it is back to the old habits and this is contrary to what the words of God is saying.
Hebrethren or 10: 26, if we continue to commit suicide after finding out the truth (from Bibit, a), there is no other choice so that the people can do it.
Since the Holy Week, you should have thought that we will share all sorts of knowledge from Bibit a. Epesos 2: 9) saying "the safety is a reward that can be achieved through good deeds that can be proud.
That's why if you are going to undergo the cross or even be frugal to death, this does not have no meaning because the safety is coming from our acceptance of Jesse-Cristo as the Lord and those who are safe.
Rome 6: 23 the payment of sin is death but the free love of God is life without him from Iglesia ni Jesus.
I am not saying it is not right to do good like helping others, but we are doing it not because we can accept it but because we are accepted by Iglesia ni Cristo and as a child of God, like us, our Father, who is doing good.
Let us reflect the words of God during the time of beware.
