Politics and PERA is the root of an assurance that Ebora is politics.

More than 300 are the "Small Town Lottery," (PMP), which was found last 2010 by Governor Migz Villafuerte, Jr. when he first won and sat as the governor of Zambales.
This is the truth: Because majority of the said 300 (MP) approved by the former administration have cancelled all of those who want to mine but this will be applied for the authorities and the right process.
Because of this, those with "mining permits" and from more than 300 are approved.
But even if the number of mining has increased, the income of the government, 40 percent, went to the barangay where the mines, 30 percent in the municipality and 30 percent in the province, are all for the needs of the citizens.
It is clear that Ebora is clear to the mining in Zambales but there are those who are not happy because, it turns out that politics and money are everywhere, which is why the defamation are being used to him and even the media.
It is wrong that the information spreading like nickel mining in the town of Masinloc will be wrong, although there is also in the town of Sta. Cruz, but it has no permit that is in the town of Sta. Cruz but the "permits" and not from the Governor's Office.
Ebora is not nervous about the case filed by 10 people from Masinloc that has no intention to stop the mining not only in Zambales but also in the whole country.
This is the truth: If there is no clear mother that will happen on the skin of the land, we should have not removed us, cement, and almost all the comfort in life this time is modern.
It will also be revealed that a "publicity" was revealed by the appointed forces that became courageous with Ebdane and in the province because in the end, the reason to prove the right and wrong is the good status of the province.
The deceitful people are not stupid that the majority of them are not pleased with the defamation of the root of politics and money against their governor.
This is the truth!
