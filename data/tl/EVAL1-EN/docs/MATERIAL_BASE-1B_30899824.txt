About to resign.

Orena Drilon.
I have been wanting to leave for a long time but, they were not yet allowed to leave, perhaps, no matter how, I still have a use in the newspaper, even if I have not been working in the office for almost a month.
There is a trace of shame to resign, this is also one kind of surrender, a direct show that you cannot fulfill the responsibility that was ordered to you and I think, if the Pope can resign, this is an ordinary person?
Even before the month is over, Joseph Rataban, who is better known by the catholics in the whole world as Pope Benediting, I thought that this is one of the position that they will hold on to their whole life, that is why I still don't know.
According to the news that I have read, one of the primary reasons why he lost his body and mind is easy to understand, and there are also a lot that needs to be seen by the Pope because he is still old and weak.
Even if there is a trace of shame, especially in the community of their stylish, he tries to resign to give a chance to be the one who has the ability to act on the duty of the United States, after this news has been filed for the next Pope, including Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle in the Philippines.
Even if it is a new decision, especially for the catholic devotees, it is far for them to be humble compared to the continuous attacks of other people in their position even though they have not fulfilled on their duties even though they have not fulfilled on their duties even though they have been lacking from their duties.
This case is stuck from Rome in the middle of the campaign of candidates on television.
