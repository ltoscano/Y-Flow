BOC on the Bureau of the US-TIDs.

He / she thinks at the Senate investigation of hearing aid which is only about the diets but if not, all of them are focused on the Davaoson Bangayan, which is why he is also focused on Davaoson Bangkal.
Asqueia was identified as Jerry Tan, is it only him who is becoming a bigger than him and if the regime of Noynoy Aquino wants to catch the godfather, they were only there in the Department of Agriculture and National Food Authority.
It is wrong that Bangayan was called by the criminals to identify if those from the Bureau of Customs themselves will find out if those from the Bureau of Customs themselves will find out that it is not a secret inside and out of BOC.
Businessmen and officials of Customs are still crying because of the number of people and officials of Customs that have changed many times, but instead of stopping, the Cus-TIDs.
As of now, a group of businessmen are looking like their questions as well as their question, they are the group given by Customs, who were given the Customs Development Authority (CEZA) and BOC (CEZA), "it is said that they do not want to make it anymore because it is said that this would not be considered."
This group is seventeen years old who is based in Port Irene, Santa Ana, Cagayan, which is being controlled by CEZA, Cagayan, which is being controlled by CEZA, they have been controlled by CEZA.
The truth is, Ang CEZ.
The Court has the command to BOC on legal activities, but there is no fear for Customs from a person near Malaca√±ang who is an enemy of the politics of a clan? Or those who are waiting for a bigger way or the businessmen of CEZA?
