Biazon, unable to take care.

The Customs officials did not escape under the leadership of Commissioner Ruffy Biazon as recently due to the P10 million worth of the x-ray and with-ray of all affected species in the country.
Such 2,300 kilos of illegal cargo trucks arrived at the Sub-Port of Manila North Harbor riding the Customs council of the South Cotabato on August 12, 2012, which was immediately alarm to the officials of Customs after they were able to travel from Cebu without appropriate documents.
The Customs has not yet gone missing for the anti-graft operation which until now, we still witnessed it.
This is a good trait for the determination shown by Biazon as his responsibility to his duty which is really admirable.
According to Biazon, it is not only the policy of the agency that he is going to implement, including the care for the natural resources of the country, he is now focusing on, especially the trend in releasing the endangered species in the country.
Because of the huge amount of sale of this kind of products outside the country, it is difficult to stop this activity, but instead of giving up Customs, "will not last long and the illegal acts will be stopped.
Biazon's decision to be passed on is right to be imposed on the law for those who are behind the case on top of it.
Biazon really does not want to take care of herself when he needs to address his job and of course, he does not want to destroy the trust given to him by President Noynoy Aquino.
It looks like Customs is really taking a jackpot with Biazon, and the return of the integrity of this agency is on the hands of the current administration.
Biazon will be a good example to the government official who did not allow the defamation he has given to his agency by some who are opportunists.
Now, the life of Customs is clearly seen who does not take care of herself and no one will take care of his responsibility to the filipino people.
