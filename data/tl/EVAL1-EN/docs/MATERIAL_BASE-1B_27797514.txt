"He is calling Jun to the Philippines, Father Justine Fuentes in Canada, how can he be from a professor and a teacher in the line of priesthood by Father Justine Trinidad, to British national priest.
In my interview with him, I found out that he was a professor in philosophy in De La Salle University in Manila, but according to him, his first love can be considered as priesthood.
"I was already in front of me before, and I thought that priesthood is not for me, so I went out and taught me." He said.

"When I once prayed, it seems that God told me, I have plans for you," he said.
This is not a joke that Father Justine Fuentes was not a joke to get to know him as a full priest.
He needs to pass through the examination and investigation of the arbishop and prove that the Lord is calling him to have a priest again and he will also return to school again.
"They sent me to Onse io and I was able to study five years, Master of theater, after I had a study, he has already returned me here in Vanglement and this is where I started to become a priest," he added.
When he became a fully priest, he also needs to change his name from Jun by Justine Fuentes.
"The Canadian, they cannot be called Jun, what they call to me is John, and sometimes I have received a different name and I chose to ask his / her birthday in my birthday, June is," he explained when he / she chose to ask him / her name, Jun.
It's been more than fifteen years that he's going to serve the Lord by Father Justine while in a foreign country, but despite being far from the country, she is still in the Philippines, even our culture and being a pro-god is being used for example.
