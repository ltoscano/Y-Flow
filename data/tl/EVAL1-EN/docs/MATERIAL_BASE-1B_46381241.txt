Candle.

Candle.

(Jony.

5: 31-47)

It is nice to watch the candle, but the candle was not done to watch it so it was done to light and to give light so that we can see the surrounding if it is dark.

If there is a small candle, it has long been consumed but only a little light can be given, but when there is a big light, it will easily be consumed, but it can easily be consumed.

The candle was also for Juan.

In these times, many of us want to become closer to yourself, they want to get to know, they want to get to know, they want to get to know them, that they are the one who needs to be helped, that they are the one responsible for the position that they run, but instead, they are fighting back at the television.

Today, he was appointed as Holy Pope, Cardinal Jorge's as vice president, we can also call him, Papa Kiko Pangilinan, we are going to call him from the balcony and he is going to help us from traveling but going to Christ.

I hope that we should be like a candle, it gives light but it is not for himself but to see other people around, especially in the time of darkness, we should be instruments to bring other people to the Lord.
