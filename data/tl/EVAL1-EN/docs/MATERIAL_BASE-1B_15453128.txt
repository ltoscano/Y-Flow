The LP will talk about the local candidates.
March 29, 2016 with the latest survey of Pulse Asia and SWS, the fight for presidency and vice-President will only be a little bit more than the vice president, but if it can be remembered, Senator Grace Poe will only run for 5 points, but if it can be remembered, it was a circle of ball, and many can still happen in the last week of the campaign.
One thing that will be talked about by the Liberal Party (LP) is most of the local officials of the whole country, but if we are not going to go to the precincts where it can be found out that it is not far from the police to vote, but if it is true that it is true that the leaders of President Noynoy Aquino will be defeated, I am sure that it would be better for them to join these officials.
There are still many things that can happen in the election but what is important is that the groups and cities in the entire country can make sure that there is a group in every municipal hall and cities in the entire country to ensure that there is a group in every municipal hall and cities in the entire country to ensure that there is a group in every municipality and cities in the entire country to ensure that there is a group in the Philippines that we do not lose in the election in our country.
