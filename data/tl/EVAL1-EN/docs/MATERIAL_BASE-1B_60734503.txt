"Alvarez stated in the PDEA.

I am already confused, his / her mind, why the PNoy administration has being beaten by the PNoy administration.
We are convinced that the number of drug addicts, Paul Alvarez, is really a good basketball player, Mister Exctioned!
Even PDEA agents caught the drug basketball player, proven to be a good "team players."
Just think, a few witnesses in arresting Paul Alvarez whispered to us that he really loves PDEA agents.
But Alvarez immediately thought about it through a long-off "for a long-year-old man."
And it is really effective, make it be effective, because of a slave, "this is from the pockets of PDEA agents!
They immediately sent out that Alvarez allegedly surrendered to PDEA agents to enter the rehabilitation center!
Let us examine this, a drug addict who wants to undergo rehab, why do you need to surrender to PDEA to be treated?
Why did he just reveal himself to shame, something that is impossible to be done by a celebrity!
Because their type, as long as they do not go away from the eyes of only one thing, they would be given birth or continue to go to the rehab!
And after what they went through, it will eventually surface, she cries and cried again!
That is why, if General AÃ±o is really serious to clean PDEA (Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency), he should investigate the case of Paul Alvarez!
He will surely have Exctioned!
