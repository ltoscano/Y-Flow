FM burial at September By Bernard Taguba, 12, 2016 because President-elect Rodrigo Duterte has the blessing of former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. at the Libingan ng mga Bayani in September.
Senator Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Junior visited Duterte in Davao City last Friday night so he can personally thank it.
A sign that it is possible to happen in September but there is no clear details regarding this, the month of September is historical because the old Marcos declared Martial Law in 1972 while September 11 is the day of her birth.
The losing vice vice president believes that the history between his family and the country will be reduced if his father will be buried in the Libingan ng mga Bayani.
"The wish of the Marcos family is to be an only son to the United Nations as well," according to Marcos in a press conference yesterday.
Militant lawmakers did not respond to the legislative chamber to ask his reaction.
But it can be recalled that in an old interview with Bayan Muna partylist Rep. Neri Colmenares, he said that it did not reach this situation if former President Fidel Ramos would allow the burial of the remains of the former dictator in the Philippines last 1993.
