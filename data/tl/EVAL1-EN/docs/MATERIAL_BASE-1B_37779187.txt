The Batiles of Subic was the gate.

They are going crazy about the main Gate Bridge in Subic Bay to undergo millions of reasons.
This is true: Although the bridge should be the concern of DPWH, in the administration and this is the care of Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA).
There is no problem in the SBMA and DPWH, on the side of the Olongapo City in the city hall of a Jimmy Lo-Fahana alias JLo, who is no official official, aside from the nephew of Mayor Bong Gordon, the problem, as well as well.
If you get money away, JLo might be the ones named by Mayor Gordon as well in these moments, there is no one who does not want to buy P2 million in the leadership of one named Lamasan, who is said to have paid P2 million to the bridge in the bridge in the bridge in the bridge in the bridge in the bridge in the bridge in the bridge in the bridge in the bridge in the bridge in the bridge in the bridge in the bridge in the bridge.
The nephew of Mayor Gordon is doing anything that is being done by Mayor Gordon as saying he has nothing to do with it.
This is the truth: It's just simple if Bong Gordon is not involved here - he ordered JLo to his harassment and desire to go and go through it.
There have been a night market near the largest Gate bridge in the stretch of Coletton Street (former Personal Economic Cooperation (former Persist back), according to Laiza Espiritu, who was allegedly tortured by other than P3 million pesos to JLo still.
What is worse, it is still being discussed in the council if they will be allowed or not the construction of the night market which is against local businessmen.
As a matter of fact, if the city's fund-raising is said, the businessman Conrad Tiu has already offered money for how much will be the earnings in the night market, and he added, he should not continue.
But JLo, is not interested because if that is, he will enter all the money from the country's funds and he, and Bong, you know, that is nothing, right?
