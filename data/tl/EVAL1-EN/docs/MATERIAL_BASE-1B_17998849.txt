In the transfer of Chief Supt. Isagani Genabe, Jr., former Manila Police District director, as regional director of Cagayan de Oro, the station of Cagayan de Oro has sure that the station and unit commanders are sure to suffer if it is not deserving to take.
This are the officials of the official who did not care about their connection with the Manila City Hall and their officials who are their buddies, are this known by Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada?
It seems that Mayor Estrada has not yet arrived at the knowledge of Mayor Estrada that most of the police assigned to good location are all affected by his trusted official.
Even if the mayor does not know that the Manila would want to return again, he will possibly return to Lim if he cannot stop.
The helper of Mayor Erap is happy with the disappearance of General Isagani Genabe Jr., because they are free to pay the officials who approached them to make sure that the officials who approached them will be protected. "
Tugna believes that they will not benefit from the coming days before his hand will come during his hands so that the only station commanders of Mayor Estrada will not also accept after the good purpose of the mayor.
But it is not really lucky if the people of Isagani Genabe and it was replaced by an official known by the journalists and his fellow police who are suspected to be a protector of thieves, snatchers, muggers and pickpocket.
Or Cabagnot, there will be no obstacle to the prevalence of corrupt officials in the MPD because Isagani Genabe has no obstacle in the prevalence of Mayor Erap in the exchange of district director?
After all, it is good for Genabe to have his appointment in Region 10 because it is a promotion that his jurisdiction and experience of the police will get bigger because he served in the place for a long time because he served for a long time.
