Fate of the teachers.

I want to be happy for the abandoned by our Ambassador in Indonesia who is currently being abandoned by the country of Indonesia and they do not have to find a small school to teach them and if there is a small amount of remittance for our economy.
It is also so good to think that until now, Filipinos are still looking up to another race, especially when it comes to teaching the word English which is the reason for the Koreans in the country to study in English.
On the other hand, I am worried because, while some of our fellow countrymen are anxious, we should finally leave English and use the filipino countries to hug him to improve the ability of their citizens.
Our country is gradually free from our hands, and it is also the reason why our country is the primary root of our country, this is the primary reason for our country to give hundreds of jobs for our countrymen.
I am also worried because our country is slowly running out of good teachers because they want to go back to another country instead of taking a risk in their hands, because some of their students are still hoping to sell tocino, and some of their students and their parents.
I remember that during the time of the government of the countries like Vietnam and Thailand, they send their students to the Philippines to give it to the Philippines so long before the Philippines became the biggest gold medal for the whole world.
Don't it be an accident to think that while our neighboring countries are used for their benefits, they continue to neglect them and our teachers, we continue to neglect them, while the Koreans and Indonesian are twisted in English?
