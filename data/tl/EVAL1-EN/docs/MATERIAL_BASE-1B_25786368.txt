Wealth.

Wealth (LE. 12-13), "Daang Matuwid", "you did not know that you will not accept what is rich from you," I said that you will not accept what is rich from you, "I still wanted to receive a lot of money from the Lord," I asked that you will be used to give to us, "I said that it is not right for you to go to heaven," I still wanted to give her money to us, "I said that you will be used to entering into the sky," I still wanted to accept it, "said the saint."
