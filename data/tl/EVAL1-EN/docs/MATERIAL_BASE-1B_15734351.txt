I am right, Senator Grace, and then.

It is a good lawmaker even before in the Senate, each of them is studying in front of it, with Senator Grace Poe, son of Da King - Fernando Poe, Jr.
Senator Grace Poe's reaction is right against those who benefited from him to run for a higher position in the upcoming elections in 2016 - President or Vice President, many have fallen into the trap due to the end, however, they are getting mad at the end.
It is not enough basis for the survey as basis, especially if it is just paid by the price hike of survey results, how will you take it back to Secretary Albert Del Rosario of Foreign Affairs, DTI) and others.
The pipe was big!
Even if the President is not a joke, if the preparation is not enough to look at President Benigno Aquino III, it is just because of the emotion of the people who took advantage of the "businessmen" in politics, who took advantage of the "businessman" in politics, who took advantage of the vice-President and Aquino.
The "businessmen in politics are successful in politics, and now, they are in position, which is considered as a goof power of power and money, DWD, DPWH, DA, DOH, PNP, and others.
You are right, Sen. Grace, in your decision, then you are still young and you still have a lot to learn from the bait by your fellow politicians.
A concrete example there is Mar Roxas, isn't it?
The bait may be from the camp of Cojuangco-Aquino or to Binay himself.
For now, it would be better, Sen. Grace Poe, to face your job as lawmakers of the Senate to make a meaningful law that is appropriate for the country and the people, we believe in your ability.
Let them go outside or Labo in 2016.
