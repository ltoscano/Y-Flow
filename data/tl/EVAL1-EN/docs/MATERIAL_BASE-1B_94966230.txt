The news is sad that it is still comatose until the hours that we are writing this is the former famous basketball player Samboy Lim-so-called Skyker.
Hopefully, Samboy was okay, he should wake up and finally got healed.
The idol of many youth Samboy Lim when he was famous, I am an avid fans.
Samboy is part of the basketball player which is famous before and we can still see that as coach and Peras, there are public utility vehicles and others are businessmen.
But there are former basketball player, whom we are pointing at, and those who are suffering from poverty and are experiencing heavy challenges in life.
The former basketball star is part of the history of the Philippine Sports Center due to their contribution in this field, and there is an important place where they are in the hearts of the Filipinos.
Maybe we should just pay attention to them somehow with a little care and attention.
My advice as a fans is given a part of acknowledging the former superstar in every game at the PBA.
For example, there will be a bothers for the former superstar when there is a game.
The bookkeeper just took pictures and video of the former superstar, to see his fans now.
It can also be invited for him to deny.
They can also sell the PBA and the profit can be made into a way for our former superstar to help them.
Through acknowledging their contribution in the past time, the former glitter of their stars can be returned.
I know that former colleagues Samboy is in support of him now and we will pray for her safety.
Hopefully there will be an opportunity for the former superstar, PBA like Samboy Lim to have a very much love from their famous fan through the management of PBA.
He / she was wearing.
