The lungs was once again.

Not only is having a smart mind if needed; the primary importance should be used for benefits.

Every time I go home in Balanga, I always go through a chicken, and I just buy a chicken that I liked as a huge viand, while I was waiting for it to be cooked when they got torn into a huge viand, I noticed that they would be included in the burning house.

I realized that this is also what is happening in our faith as if we get tired and lived in our lives, until we continue to separate from each other, we have no ability to sleep in our life, until we continue to separate and be active to make a big difference between each other and be active to make a big difference and improve life.

We can only do a trip to this world of this world and the fares of our future is if we live in our glory or, for our self.

What you are doing for.

Many of us not noticed that, why are we continue to worry, confused, and cannot be erased where the path is going.

In this moment, you will ask yourself; I am in the right direction of my life?

But in a while, you will understand that you can understand your future through returning to the past towards the present.

The past and future are only happening in our memory that the current moments is outside the time, this is not yet repeated and it will not happen again if you want to be sure with what you want, that is now what you want to do.

It not yet too late.

What's only needed is our eyes became aware of the long move and see the light of our glory.

This is our great mission that we are scheduled to fulfill.

What are you waiting for?

City of Balanga, Bataan.
