Secretary Paje, fond of excuse.

So that the Senate and even President Benigno Aquino III did not go back to Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Ramon Paje and Natural Resources of others even though the failure is from him.
It is not good type of attitude of a chief to implement his mistakes in order to save themselves from what kind of officials should be prudent, "if not, it can also be called" double. "
Why didn't Paje ate the tension happening in Zamboanga del Sur instead of being pointed out by former DENR Secretary Lito Atienza, which was released by the Special Action Force which can be mine in the said province?
It was said that there was an exchange of money during the time of Atienza because Paje acted as the mining adviser of the undersecretary for the field operation.
The prevalence of the previous government is done.
Isn't it possible to revoke the permit?
Maybe it is not because Paje and debts has also benefited for money, perhaps this will decrease in Zamboanga del Sur Gov. Antonio Cerge.
Paje was so out of hiding because of the natural wealth of his province is what mining Corporation is doing, but he could not do anything because the DENR was permission from him.
Because it is already known for his failure, Leo Jasareno, director of the Bureau of Mines, Paje, who is doing the doing of the Special Action Force (LP), although it is fake for them to be with the DENR.
My goodness, isn't it really nothing to do, Paje, if he is not to avoid it, is it right that he will throw Jasareno to have no use of DENR in the fight.
Those who spend money for nature?
There are more illegal mining in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao which can cause danger to our countrymen for all of them, it is certain that Paje and Jasareno should not be benefited from we are not included in implementing "straight path."
