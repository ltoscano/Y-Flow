PNoy will not stop against poverty.

President Noynoy Aquino has no plans to stop the fight against poverty of the country as proof of the programs that he brought to the public inside his administration.
The trust of the public to the President is clearly seen with the public's trust that compared to the previous administration, the livelihood of the Filipinos today will be light because they say that the country's situation has improved because the Filipino masses would feel good changes in the situation of our country.
Until present, the President is still very hard to fulfill his promise to support the Filipino people with the best of his ability because the Filipinos are his real boss. "
But those who are fighting against him are not contented with the attention shown by President Aquino on the rise of the economy of the country, naturally, always make a way and hole to contradict any statement of the Palace in the easy words, for the critics of Aquino, he did not do anything right.
PNoy is not thin or sensitive about the comments and criticisms against him in relation to what he did, he is doing it, but just like an ordinary person, he has a heart and feelings, just like with thick faced.
That's why in Aquino's desire to succeed in his program to suppress poverty, non-stop from different countries that will give us financial help, education, defense and strengthening the economy.
We should only understand the criticisms against the President that he inherited from the problems of poverty in the first administration of the country, for the leaders who did not reveal the "straight path, so that the corruption and corruption in the government that became the root of poverty should be stopped.
Let us give time and chance to fix the way towards prosperity of the country, that is why instead of criticizing the economy of the country, it is possible that the economy of the country will be suppressed because the country is orderly and peaceful in a country going to progress.
