Already gone.

Already gone.

It is gladdening to know if we are doing all of your Christmas, perhaps, what you are doing is all of your Christmas, maybe what would you say: Father Father, not even a cent, all of presents, "we all have a cent of presents."

Siblings, after Christmas fell, our pocket gone through the pocket.

Even the strength, forgotten because of exhaustion, and we agreed to have a desire.

Why is it like that every Christmas, we can go to their desire to taste it, because it is really the true spirit of Christmas: To the Lord who showered themselves up to the Lord who took care of God for the people, to a person, to their desire.

Sibling, if you were about to think about it, you will be happy and celebrate because you feel the true spirit of Christmas, and do not forget, even if you were able to forget about it, we had a lot of joy.

And when you have a lot of resentment, even if you want you to get married, you feel that you are full of trees.
