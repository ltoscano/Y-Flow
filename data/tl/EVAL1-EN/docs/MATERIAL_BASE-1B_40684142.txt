Hammer (M19: 3-12)
There is one story about a priest of a parish priest, let us just hide him with the name of Father Mike, sometimes, they want him to separate and there is no reason why they will live together.

Father. Mike went away and took his room when he returned, he was carrying a hammer when father and wife asked what Father Mike asked when he took a hammer.

"He answered:" Didn't you want to separate?

"We will die if you did that," Father Mike: "Said that only death will be separated from you, so I will just kill you... that, when Father Mike was after her, she did not know if she was stabbed.

Jesus: Pangilinan said that the man will leave his father and mother, and he would work together with her husband, and they will be one... that there is no perfect wife or wife. "

The time comes when she is awake, there are times that those who are standing up in front of the altar let go back to the history of the altar that they will be together in front of the altar that they would be together, which is why Aiza has given the separation.

That is why don't be hard on your head if not, you are applying to Father Mike on his hammer.
