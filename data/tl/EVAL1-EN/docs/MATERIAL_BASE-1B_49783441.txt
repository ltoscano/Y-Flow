You will leave Satan!

I have been happy for a few months because I have been with my family and child during Christmas until New Year in fact, I seem to have no more happiness because I am here in the Philippines every night.
Here in our country, in our place, I am often drinking with alcohol and friends when I still want to go home to my friends, sometimes I still want to be happy before going back to work.
My friends, while my friends are happy, I am getting tired and if he does not want me to get sick, maybe if you do not want me to get sick, I might just help me if I have something to hear about it when I hear that it is against my friends.
I am not going to fix my house but it is not important because I will be able to return again for the next day.
Because in other countries, life is a bit difficult because aside from being sad, I don't know when I am far from the family, I am also afraid that I would be able to go back to the family because I am just taking care of my time when I am in the house.
I have a lot of plans especially to my family but it is like every time I have plans, I don't just look at what would be the next chapter because we know, life has different faces or story.
I was able to buy his own motorcycle and I have also had a house for the first time I left me, but because I still want to have a good car, it's because I don't want to have a good car, but because I don't want to get money anymore, I hope that I will leave me, so I can just pay my debts.
Now I am about to leave again, since I leave my wife and child who almost did not give time to each other, we often fight because of too much drunkenness, but when I peeked through my shortcomings, Production!
I was going to go to my grandmother, who insisted me to finish studies, if not because of his advice, I also called my father and mother that I am about to leave.
It is good to live when there is money but life is difficult if it is far from the family.
