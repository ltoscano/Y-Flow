It is a burden.

It looks like this is the start of the downfall of his fame, it is not a joke that the 15 percent of his countrymen is not a joke, and it seems that his rating of former President Gloria Arroyo will already confess.
In the side of PNoy, my belief is strong that he has no other agenda but to improve the situation of our country and this is still my belief that, until now, many of us are still worried about the governance of our government.
But it is obvious that our president is not ready to face the truth that not all friends, school and Kabarilan (KKK) are also clean their goal for the country.
Don't really make sure that there are no Filipinos who think bad for the country but their good intention is worthless if all the good intention is erased if all the good intention is erased if this is approved by being greedy and greedy.
This is what PNoy should think thoroughly before his trust to him by our people is totally complete, he needs to look into whatever is really the contribution of the people around him for the good of our country and that is the same for their shortcomings.
He needs to scrutinize the complaints of the country regarding the dehumanies of his people who trust just like Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa, Environment Secretary Ramon Paje and Agriculture Secretary Proceso Alcala.
These people are just some of the reasons why those who called him are becoming a villain, which is painful for him to end a drinking session but there are things that are more important like the love of God and for the country.
It is time to buy PNoy, which is more than his KKK or the welfare of our citizens.
