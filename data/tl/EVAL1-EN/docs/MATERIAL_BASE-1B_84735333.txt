It is a great example of PNoy in the ocean.

The grief of our countrymen is still fresh for the disappearance of Secretary Robredo of DILG and his companions recently in Masbate, in this kind of time, the Filipino people showed that this is the reason why the filipino masses has happened in a tragic tragedy.
At this point, it is very good to think that this kind of event is part of this kind of events, however, my prayer would not happen again, however, my prayer is to continue and left us by our beloved Secretary.
The participation of the different sectors and agencies for the deceased is invaluable, and there are also many who say that this is this and that is what we should thank and be the protagonist in the meeting of the remains of the deceased.
But, according to the members of the Hala Dom which became a part of the search and rescue for all the operations, the result of all the operation is due to their unity and cooperation with the only purpose of the real motive in the said operation.
I hope that the spirit of Bayanihan will continue, not only at the end of the search, rescue and feval operations but also in our daily activities, so as well as our siblings, we can help us in the advancement of this goal, that is why we are Filipinos!
