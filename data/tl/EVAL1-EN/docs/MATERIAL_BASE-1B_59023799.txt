General Santos, Uy, about their way.
Yes, they are the one who's the one to love.
They are aware of the love that you are asking about, that we have a point; we are able to talk to each other; we are able to talk to each other; we have not talked to anyone else, right?
That's why we are very pitiful; we have no idea, that we are not in line; I think there are people who are annoying; I thought of the line of buddy.
Fittest; we will fetch, ah, what is the companion of Jerome to guides; we will be together first before you decide, right?
It is a bit good thing that it is not a game for them to always catch them to catch you.
