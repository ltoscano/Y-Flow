Hmmmp: The always question: Where to get it?
June 15, 2016.
The policemen here are very happy here in the maltreatment done by Senator Alan Peter Cayetano that they are planning to make up the salary of the policemen.
That is very beautiful, even the people, be happy with the good care of the police.

The management of the Philippine National Police (PNP) is right that it is an effective cure for the temptation of Kotong, delusion, sideline and other form of corruption in their ranks.
If this is how much the salary is that big, it is not acceptable reason for them to make money in illegal ways or sometimes, there are really a point that there are policemen, firemen and even the jail guards who are also risking their lives in fulfilling their duties?
Even the public schools that do not permit that, those who do not agree that they do not have a good pay, even if they do not have a good wage increase, but will be a big salary to other employees of the government.
The question: Where will they get the payment for the coming plan?
Here, it is also a plan of the Department of Agriculture (DA) that the toll fee or trucks will not be charged by the toll fee and fish in this way, the price of these in the market will curse, that is good!
But it will also lessen the government.

That is also a big amount!
The pension increase of the SSS senior members also plans to increase, the question: How can the funds have a budget for the benefits of the next generation of pensioners?

It is scary because the Active members might be charged with a higher monthly contribution.
All the expenses, there should be a proper state that can be given to a proper place, but if not, hearing aid can be released by President Noynoy Aquino from the negative connotation.

It looks like their solution is an additional burden in the seat but all the businessmen are only except.
