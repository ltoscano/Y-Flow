INC meddling with the task of the government?

Many of us have heard stories or rumors about the Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC) to intrude and work in the government.
It seems that it seems to be "tiktiks" by a picture of the letter that gave them the knowledge of the people who will support the citizens.

.
This may be as a sign in fear for the members of the INC, especially to those who were taken to the IDPs, so the government will stop meddling with the topic of their sect.
According to the derogatory, it has been a long time that the leaders of the INC have been using their influence not only to the police, but also in other offices of the government that cannot be done but to follow the said wish.
Isn't it not meddling with the leaders of the INC with the government every election, when the candidate approached and asked for the blessing and endorsement of their members, that can make the unity of the votes of their members to support the favored candidates?
Justice Secretary Leila de Lima is doing his job, who allegedly had doubts about it, when the complaint of the serious illegal detention case that was filed by the former president ISamson is filed against the eight leaders of the INC.
But in the view of the members of the INC, this is an equivalent to the discussion of the church and violation of the 1987 Constitution which is proof that the The separation of the church is the state of the church. "
Because they are asking for the resignation of De Lima, that he is just waiting for his duty in relation to the complaint filed by a citizen who by a former owner of the INC, the secretary of the DOJ who intervened in the government?
