Horny.

This time of a gun ban, I found a new project, and this is the cause of death.
It's because I was happy when I saw a group of Racal who was riding his belongings it is not an ordinary Mountain bike or a bike but the small-coloured bicycle which should be called into a bike.
The concoction is very good because you can put it inside the trunk or the space space of your vehicle and if you think about a bike, it is easy to release it.
Through this, you can park your vehicle and if the traffic is a bit worse, you will be about to start a part of your destination.
It is also possible that you can bring it (almost 13 kilos of a bicycle) and will get along with a jeep, in bus or MRT), it will be allowed to put it to your final destination because there are those who are selling the bicycle for you to put it inside the bicycle for it to be easier to bring.
I have thought that, if our government needs the support of the country to improve the money of the country to improve the pocket of our politicians, maybe time will come, especially in Metro Manila and the flow of traffic in our streets will come true.
Perhaps, many of our countrymen are going crazy and instead of spending a lot of money to exercise in the expensive gym in order to exercise for money and their bodies will be stronger.
The only problem of those fast on the bicycle is their safety in our streets.
Because there are so many abusive drivers, especially the drivers of passenger jeepneys and buses that don't care if driving.
Even though there are towns like Marikina and Quezon City that placed a bike lane on their main roads, it is still not yet allowed to board the main cities so that one of us will board a use of their house going to their home or in school.
This should be one of the things that should be done now by Metro Manila Development Authority Chairman Francis Tolentino, especially since the increase of our fellow countrymen who are quickly watering the bicycle is very fast, especially in a bike.
In fact, it is very active today by the group Muammar Askali aels of the Philippines which is headed by Pio Fortuner, Junior in their purpose that the use of folder bike as an alternative vehicle can worsen.
The TSP) believes that through using a medical bike, the southwest monsoon will be clean and our citizens will become stronger.
Aside from this, there are still a lot of tasks that have been made by the Tabag, which was built by the small group last 2009.
Just last week, I was with his allies in TSP) to ensure that I could not believe that I could not believe that I was able to avoid it but now that the PSP) was very beautiful, which is why the PSP) has no other destination.
Taw, for great actors.
