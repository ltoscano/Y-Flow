This November, we are worried about our loved ones in fact that during this whole month, we should also visit a mass with our fellow countrymen who are still living in front of the cemetery, if you can still visit you, it is only a few days that we love them!
God who is our God - the Lord is the only one in love with the Lord who has no love for our fellowmen, and when we look at it, it is better to love our fellow countrymen who have no love for us, and if we look at it, it is better for us to love our lives and not just to love our lives and not only the dead!
