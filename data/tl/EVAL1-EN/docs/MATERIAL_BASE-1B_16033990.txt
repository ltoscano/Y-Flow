In the morning, I cannot do anything but what we are going to go near the high school, we should just wait for the signal that we need to go near to the High School; we will only take a way of practice each other one day.
Use this for an hour.
Okay.
Ah, what's okay, what kind of our time, PNoy: We do whatever time we are.
It's okay to look down; as long as they wake up, until four o'clock in the afternoon.
