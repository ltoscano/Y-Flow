OFW in the heart of Kevin Reyes.

In the midst of the worsening conflict in Egypt and Syria, the pity for our countrymen is not hidden from our fellow countrymen who are there, and are currently detained in the events of the two countries who are in the Middle East.
So my advice is that they just go home and to our loved Philippines only to always take a livelihood.
He said that many business will be given to them to give a good life to them.
According to Representative Reyes, when they go home to the country of the affected OFWs, there are also help that the government is offering, including in selecting their capital for those who want to be businesses.
The Overseas Social Welfare Administration will rule the details about business and capital which wants to achieve the coming OFW from Syria and Egypt.
According to him, the Department of Labor laws are ready to give seminar for OFWs who want to start a business in the Philippines.
Along with this is the call of the famous congressman, who is a former OFW to those affected by our countrymen in Syria and Egypt to listen to the advice of the DFA and left there while there is still time and while they are in good condition.
As of now, the DFA is implementing the evacuation center of Filipinos who are in the two mentioned countries.
Congan also assured the support of the programs that will expand their jobs to be able to encourage the OFWs to stay in the country instead of taking a risk in overseas.
We also agree with this statement to Alcides. Reyes, because the truth is, our fellow OFWs need the care of the officials of the government.
Other officials of the government should take action, like the things done by Tikw. Reyes, to know the OFW who are in their country will know that there are officials who are going to support the officials, like mushrooms. Reyes.
