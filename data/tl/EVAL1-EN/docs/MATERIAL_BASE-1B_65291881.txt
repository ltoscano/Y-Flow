We were not surprised when James Blanco said that they are planning to go to New Zealand because they want to buy a piggery there.
It seems that they want to study their children.
When he went to New Zealand, Judy Ann Santos and Ryan Agoncillo, they have already found out of the said country and it seems that they already want to live there in New Zealand who wanted to live there in New Zealand who wanted to take a shot of the movie he will do at Regal Manuel Co who managed to take a shot.
Ndela Cruz has a unique mother, who became more famous because of the Lord of the Rated film that was approved by the famous kiwi director, Peter Jackson.
In New Zealand has been living in New Zealand with James named Tania Dimabogti, which is why he knows how to live there.
They have three children, which they seem to have plans to study because aside from the good education system there is more cheap compared to other countries.
Maybe during Christmas, they went to the family there to look respectable and will be able to look into a noodle house for the children.
14 years old, James married in Tania.
The actor admitted that there was a chance that she was wrong with her husband and asked her to ask for forgiveness.
He does not want to say that he has made a mistake for several times, James is very thankful that his wife is religious and he did not leave him.
He said he has changed and he / she has already changed now.
At the age of 35 years old, James takes care of her body so he can see his former lover or just call him / her F (or will be a love to his girlfriend.
If his wife will allow him to show his revenge on or even in front of him, but the movie should have doubts.
Acres, Wish, James is able to make a serious gay film that has shown the life of gay people, who are happy outside but inside, life is sad.
It has been a lot of friend, James, who was taking a step on her about it.
It is okay with him if he has a gay sex that is really needed in the movie.
James was watched in the First indie films which was one of the six members of 1st ToFarm in Film Festival.
