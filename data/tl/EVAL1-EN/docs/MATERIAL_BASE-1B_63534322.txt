One columnist of a newspaper said the statement of President Noynoy Aquino, who is Secretary Edwin Lacierda, when he said that the government can't do anything if our OFWs in different parts of the world are not able to do anything.
"Tsacheva, a free of Country, said that Lacierda said and his decision is to send or not dollars to the Philippines are in every OFW but their family will be affected, not the Aquino administration.
This was the last part of Edwin Lacierda, who was called by a columnist, who is brimming.
If they will fall short, what Lacierda said is right about the "entry of Country" and in every OFW's decision if they will not be carried away.
But all of these are a message - an important message given by the OFWs from PNoy and in the opinion of said columnist, "said the reaction of Lacierda as the spokesperson of the President.
Even before, we already have what has been saying about the Zurbano family.
Even before, I saw that it can be a way for a heavy message to encourage the thousands of OFWs outside the country to not give the dollars, together, even inside a day or "Zero."
Its goal is to send a message to notice the complaint and feelings of the OFW.
For the case now, the issue on pork barrel is the issue.
OFWs just want to reach and notice the government their opinion about this issue and it is really wrong that Lacierda's answer is that the government of PNoy will not be affected but the family of the OFWs.
Talking of this point, there is a different way to reach the message, isn't Lacierda know this?
Or sometimes, the children of PNoy are not thinking about it before the mouth is opened.
That is probably why you're calling, "you, who is called up,"
