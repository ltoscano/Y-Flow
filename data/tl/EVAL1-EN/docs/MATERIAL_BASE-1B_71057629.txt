Teach a proper service to the Filipinos.

Dear chief (Filipino Star Ngayon), Nunber 1255; UPP-May 26, 2013 - 12: 00.

I am Rhea, Quijano, in 2nd Avenue College in the course, BS Education.
I am extremely worried on the survey of the Social Weather Station (SWS) that around 3.9 million families or 19.2 percent are hungry this year compared to 16.3 percent or 3.3 million families who are hungry in the past year 2012.
But it is also placed in the survey that from March 19 to 22, 2013, there is almost a part of Mindanao when the surveys went to 1,200 families, wherein the poor were identified as pro-Tawi, Ifugao, Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Sultan Kudarat, Camiguin and Camarines Norte.
Hopefully the SWS area also went to the area when they conducted a survey of year 2012 so we still cannot say that the number of Filipinos who had a job and children who have been able to study will increase.
Even if that is the situation, I am in favor with the action of the government to focus more on the poor families, to give proper information to the farmers on how to farm the public and other livelihood for the poor.
It's because we are devastated that there are a lot of farmers in the country, but we are importation of products in other countries, only an example in America that the farmers are only about 19 percent, but they can support the needs of their citizens because of the proper farm.
The land in our country is big, however, why is it that this is not what the government should focus for the farmers, while those in the city are not aware of them, of modern technology for our advancement of Filipinos for the whole country.
