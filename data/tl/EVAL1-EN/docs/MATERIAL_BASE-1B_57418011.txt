Manila, Philippines - the catholic bishops conference of the Philippines is grateful for the mass media and Papal visit 2015-CBN Committee on their Papal visit to their Papal visit?
In relation to this, CBCP is hoping that CBCP to the mass media executive secretary Father Lito Jilian is hoping to support each one the theme of the Papal visit, love and concern for others in releasing the items being thrown.
Father Jilian was stated by Father Jilian, "Paula," the theme of the Papal visit 2015, which should be the release of the Pectment and even a souvenir.
It can be sent out by CBCP to the mass media chairman Secretary Mylo Hubert's mass with everyone to make sure that they can use the right way through the statement of good news through the destruction and picture of Pope Francis Magbanua.
