Earnest greetings with money.
By Al-Santiago July 22, 2016.
Just like the same candidates for senator, on May 9, Manny Pacquiao spent the victory in May 9, but also launched his money to the bank.
Though he does not want to admit it, but the pocket of Pacquiao is also hurt because of that, they need to recover even the money released from the election.
The solution?
I said that Pacquiao will eat his promise, he will face Bradley on the third time (2-1 with their score).
If the charisma of power is a joke, the effect of money is more temptation.
Pacquiao strongly disagreed even if it was seen in the election, but a waste of money is still wasted every time he will fight.
It is not important to know who are his opponents, Ternal, Postigo, Jessie Vargas, and even PO 3 Floyd Mayweather Jr.
Although he is 37 years old, Pacquiao is still able to make it and the strongest style is that we are still experiencing the world with stomachache, "as they say.
As Freddie Roach is also holding Postigo, Ukraine, but when Pacquiao-Postigo also made it, Pacman will win.

Round in the calendar, November 6 (Phl's time) is the fight.
The Senate can do something.
