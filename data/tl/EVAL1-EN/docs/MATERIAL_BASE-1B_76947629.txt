"I called the Bible," -- Dingdong.

The Kapuso Pradia, is said to be only a type of queen, Marian Rivera, for all the events in his life now.
This is okay with Marian who seems to start immediately by a full series of television series because of course, he will surely be able to start a serious time, but aside from being a very kind of time, she will get her child with the Kapuso Pritil, mother, Dingdong Dantes, and her baby Dingdong Dantes.
"What he / she said in Encantadia, we know is just a few episodes of her, but it seems like she is already married for a few months, but it looks like she is getting married with her child for 7-month old, she still can still do many things.
It's a good thing that Dingdong was really used to fight with her, as if she is not complete with the care of the people of the country, if they are not together with a mother-in-law in London.
And it also seems that they are always the content of the mind like what he posted yet, he said that he will post it from the Halaran festival now while she was able to keep on my laughter.
First, we were impressed by the Papal park and second, I was the Miss International Airport.
