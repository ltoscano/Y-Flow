This is what SSS President ordered Chief Executive Director Emilio Aguinaldo de Quiros, in a press conference.

"About 0.6% of the increase will be equal between employees and employers, that the latter will be able to pay 348 percent based on the high-employed and Bangsamoro members to shoulder the total of 11-year-old rate."

According to President De Quiros, "the said price increase is part of the SSS Tax Agenda that are pushing for to lessen the ditures of the SSS, which is about 1.8: 00 in the 2011 and the increase of almost 8 percent every year."
