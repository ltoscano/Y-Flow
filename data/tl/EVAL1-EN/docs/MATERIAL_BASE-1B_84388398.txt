The whole force of the-year-law strongly condemned the historical force of the workers in the southern Visiting Forces of trade Universities, the increase of criminality in the province of Laguna, there is no one to blame but the increase of criminality in the province of Laguna.

It was revealed that the consecutive crimes that happened in Laguna this past month of February 14 were beaten by the elements of 1st Infantry Battalion of 202nd Infantry Brigade of the Philippine Army and his son, Majiha when he was hit by the forces of the military.

Two days after the abuse of the military in separate places, five civilians were shot by elements of 1st Infantry Battalion, 1st Special Forces Battalion, 59th Infantry Battalion and CAFGU-CAA in Magdalena, Laguna. Two were wounded in the incessant shooting of the military.
It can be recalled that last October of the past year, the murder and rape of Given Grace Campico, 19 years old, married and rape of a minor student of Los Angeles City National High School, was reported by the killing and rape of a minor student of Los Ba単os, Laguna.

This kind of news did not stop, because after more or less one week, a student of UP Onok Island was found, one of the suspects who were involved in a vacant lot in Victoria Laguna, nearby town of Los Ba単os, which was recorded in the murder of the young Moro or foreign students, which was eventually being sold by his own Moro or foreign students, which was eventually being sold by his own Moro or foreign students, which was eventually being sold by his own Moro or foreign students, which was eventually being sold by his own Moro or foreign students, which was eventually being sold by his own Moro or foreign students, which was eventually being sold by his own Moro or foreign students, which was eventually seen by his own Moro and foreign students.

Fellow police also implicated the former spokesperson of NCRPO in the kidnapping and murder of a businessman in San Pedro, Laguna last February.

While the police are being pointed to be pointed at the back of the theft in UP LB, the military under the anti-Filipino programs in different parts of Laguna.

In the times of Civil Military Academy at the barangay, there is no shame that the military violated the rights of the citizens in giving protection, the military and police who are pushing the citizens to create criminal activities like pushing drugs, prostitution, kidnapping, and others.

In these times, the true color of the force of the regime is being shown-worthy and is not focused on the status of order like what they are saying, violence and criminality against the workers.

These kinds of issues against the workers in the province of Laguna and the entire region which have been experienced criminality in the hands of capitalists have been experienced in the hands of our government and military, this became even worse in the implementation of Oplan Bantay, Li, and II of the former Marcos regime, and is still being investigated.

In the past decades, no one was identified as the mastermind of the suspect but the police and the military in the cases of killing the people like Diosdado Formanes of NMI, Carlo Rodriguez, Laguna Water District, Carlo Rodriguez, Laguna Water District, and many other leaders of the region.

In the shore of the anti-Homicide Section, those who are pushing in the campaign to anti-terrorism in the state, legal, are already launched by police and military against the community, factory, and school, and other violence against legitimate actions and citizens.

Which is caused by the current scenario, the objective of the regime, which can be placed in the control of a higher presence of the police and the entire region will make a solution, which is the reason why the regime is the responsible and the reason that he is the responsible to explode in his face and shows the real goal.
