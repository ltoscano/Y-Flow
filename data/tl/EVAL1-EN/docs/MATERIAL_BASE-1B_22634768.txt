The EXOSB is a need for help.

One news was taken away by my attention regarding the call of a Catholic priest for the strict needs of the country by more than a text messages.
According to Father Daniel Estacio, who was admitted to have a ex-ist in the Diocese of Pasig, those who are like him are also needed because of the increasing cases of bad spirits with people.
For those who cannot determine, the ex-Fist is a person who usually is a priest and a pastor, who has the ability to fight the evil people who oppose the people.
Father. Francis Lucas, the former executive secretary of CBCP Eve, Commission on Social Communications at the mass media, said that the case of those who are going to increase in the whole country is increasing.
And because CBCP has already confirmed it, I'm sure there is a basis for this fear of the Catholic Church.
For me, I really believe that there is a need for a more called cist in the country, it is not just to fight those who are guilty are hardworking with ordinary people.
More than anyone needed to be cist in order to get away and remove the evil spirits who take advantage of the officials of our government.
Because they are one of the reasons why many of our countrymen are drowned in the quicksand of poverty.
The ex-Fist should also need to evict the evil spirits who get rid of the leaders of the most big businesses and company, that there are no other things but they feel the blood of the poor.
In other words, scattered everywhere in almost all branches and corners of the country are the people who just call him. "
But they are not obvious because they are inside extravagant houses even if they are always doing evil.
People who are like this are the first taking of the Holy Spirit of Father Estacio, so that for sure, the whole country will finally be free from the nightmare that was caused by the country.
