Juan de la Cruz.

Juan de la Cruz (Mt. 6: 1-6) a scene in the vacation of Juan de La Cruz.

Why did they not introduce themselves as an insult to the people whom he has helped, that is why what we are doing is not enough for you to know, that is why we are helping each other, and that is the reason why we are helping each other, and that is the reason why we are helping each other, and that is the reason why we are helping each other, and that is the reason why we are helping each other, and that is the reason why we are helping, that is why it is not enough for you to know and be famous.

That's why if we have something to know why we will do this thing, hopefully God is the reason why we are making a good deed.
