Four have died in the evacuation centers of Navotas and three of them were killed in the disease, one of the gave birth, one of the witnesses was raped again, according to some residents, it was said that when someone died in the evacuation centers, it was said that it was prohibited to stab the dead in the evacuation center.

As a protest to their current condition, led by Karangalan Village (Congress), the needy of the city-National Capital Region-Rizal) voted in the evacuation centers from front of Barangay Hall, Brgy. NBBS Elementary), and the citizens of Karangalan Village, R-10 Samsuraji.

According to Ka Allan dela Cruz, President of Karangalan Village, "the poor in the evacuation centers are people who lost their homes, many people who lost their rights are not doing anything, that's why there are many people who lost their rights in proper and enough housing projects, livelihood and services."

"The needy asked," Mayor, where is your program for the housing and service? "We are having a hard time in the evacuation center."

The issue of evacuation centers are not just a simple loss of home, but most of all, they have been transferred to the evacuation center only until the sixth night, but there are some who are going to go back to the evacuation center because of the lack of electricity, but the government should resolve what they experienced.

They do not want to look into the local government of Navotas on the previous floor of their home in the shore of Navotas, because this is supposedly the planned project of Navotas.

For the guidance of Karin, together with ZOthese and PK, they continue to make a move in order to achieve their rights being neglected and denied to them.

A housing project, work, service, obligation of the government!

The city of Relocation Site, implement it!

The restriction of victims of Pedring should be stopped!

Education and health of the children and youth in evacuation centers are very priority.

Human rights, fight for human rights!
