I interviewed during NCR-LTO-Elario Benjamin Santiago III to ask for an explanation about the proposal of the LTO-NCR and the chief of LTO to send money, but the accusation to him by a good citizen who wrote to my column.
He denied the accusations and said that this is only made of those who want to ruin him.
Because there are things that are implemented from the top or "DOTC" for change and improvement of the office of especially in NCR.
As a matter of fact, he / she has accepted that maybe every situation of the chief, who is more than 3 years in his position, is possible to be transferred or to ensure that they will be effective in their personnel, offices and the public.
Most of all, to lose corruption.
"All of the things are following the bosses, what I do is not personal decision and is going to add to it before it is implemented," according to EpiPen. Santiago.
