The trust of PNoy.

It can't be denied of the trust of the filipino masses to the administration of President Noynoy Aquino as a result of showing the determination to continue and implement reform in the government.
According to the latest survey conducted by the Social Weather Stations (SWS), this month of August, the highest position of PNoy was recorded since he sat in his position last June 2010 where his current trust was hit.
It was also found out that the trust of the people with the President has increased from different parts of the country from different parts of the country.
This will only prove that transparency and Accountability of PNoy believes that the public trust will go back to the plans of the government.
That is why, the Philippines is continuously implementing the straight path that is once promised by PNoy and now, fortunately, we pass through it.
Even though PNoy is running over the government which is implemented by PNoy, that sometimes, it will result to a desirable accusation against the current administration, this is just a good sign that it will not be moved from the people.
