Reporting, Senator Chiz.

Senator Vicente Tito Sotto III almost worshiped is the debate on the issue of the Reproductive Health Organization.
Manisn't mean that the senator is still young for defending NB because according to him, his life is sacred, "
Senator Sotto's call for himself was "pro-Life."
And not just an ordinary person, its capital is the capital of Sotto to being a pro-ray, "in fact, he has been bullying.
"It's because he said, his honor was said to be fervent for" Dicierto of his life, "said that it has reached a" speech of "speech" by a great ally, but now, Sen. Sotto said that as time passes, as well as the resolve of a senator is fading!
Just recently, he passed the Senate Bill 2080 which is pushing to bring back the death penalty here in our country.
The truth is, it is not the purpose of it, to send it to the proposal of Sotto because we are one of the opposing supporters to bring back the death penalty so that there would be a little fear that the death penalty is exposed and without care if doing heinous crimes.
And so that the death sentence will not be felt, we still have suggestions that it does not need to costly and not painful.
The punishment should be killed by them.
It's as if you will be happy to meet the Animal welfare!
If we will be returned to Senator Sotto, how will that be, sir, then, you are not the pro-mannered family?
Does it mean that you supported the RH Law which is currently on the Supreme Court?
Admit it!
