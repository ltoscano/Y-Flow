"We did not buy and we were not a thief," President Noynoy Aquino said.
So, who is the thief? "The President did not say who stole and who was the thief.
Only the red uniform of our Mister President is why he does not want to tell who stole and who was the thief.
But he said who did not buy and who was the thief.
They are the people who take care of the President, "are people who have your own efforts to fulfill their sworn duties."
We do not have any doubt in our Ombudsman, "isn't it that the leaders of the Commission on Audit) did not depend on the documents, that is why it is found out that the abuse of PDAF (Priority Development Assistance Fund) is discovered, that is why the Ombudsman is found in a straight path, because the Ombudsman is also included in the straight path.
So, who has cases now in the Ombudsman?
Senate President Franklin Drilon has a future case in the Ombudsman.
Recently, congressman Augusto Syjuco Junior will file a 65-million plunder case against Drilon.
