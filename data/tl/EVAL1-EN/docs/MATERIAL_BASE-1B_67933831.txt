Different kind.

Filipinos have a different kind of reaction about the victory of Manny Pacquiao in his fight in Macau last Sunday.
Even before our countrymen gave any comments about the details of the fighting that happened, many thanked the national fist first.
Thank you so much to Manny, here in the Philippines and even our fellowmen in other countries, through social media.
Different types.
It's embarrassing.
Thank you for an inspiration.
Thank you for the hope you gave, Manny.
Thank you, Pacman, for a Filipino spirit.
Even those who are devastated by Yolanda in the Visayas Region are awakened and full inform on Manny's victory, that's why they themselves won.
Congressman Manny Pacquiao has helped those who were devastated by the typhoon as his win, which is why it is just like Pacquiao who has declared Pacquiao as the winner.
Manny is said to have a different kind of boxer now, careful and seems to feel pity for Rios, according to the observation of some of them, that is why many are not really hurt because even if we are not really scared of anyone from Manny's victory.
As said by coach Freddie Roach said, he is happy with the fight shown by Manny Pacquiao for those who can make it end with the lack of lack of fact that his coach is not able to make the strength of their partnership again.
Manny's heart is still full of fire, for the country.
Just think that if she has not brought home the crown, what should be done to grieve, but we almost know the content of the heart and feelings of a Manny Pacquiao.
It is a great American athletes who, since then they offered everything to the Lord and the country.
Again, we did not disappoint our hero, in the time that we need her inspiration.
Thank you very much, Manny Pacquiao.
