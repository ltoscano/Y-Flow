Caloocan's New York.

New leaders, new hope!
"That is all the same statement that says that he would resign from the remains of the leaders and residents of Caloocan City that we have talked to and be prudent.
Recently, the captain of the city were united in appointed Barangay Nabalawag in Barira.
With the effects of his appointment, the burial, son of Mayor Oca Malapitan presented, as one of the members.
City Council.
He has a big and important thing in the city council to promote the programs and projects of the barangay.
Mayor Orca is living with a councilor in his plans for the death of Caloocan in poverty.
Caloocan is one of the places or cities in the country that it is early to progress if we talk about progress because of their innate wealth.
But as time passes, he left and got discouraged.
This is said to be the cause of corruption and the existing politics.
Many believe that Mayor Orca is elected as mayor of city in the past elections, the Caloocan City will rise again.
In history, Mayor Orca received the biggest votes, proof that the people from Caloocan are very high.
But with the number of problems, it cannot be considered that the city would not be alone to bring the city for a clear situation.
To succeed, he needs Kon. Isabel, who like him is a good servant of the country to support the programs and projects that will bring again to Caloocan in the peak of progress.
Just like his father who became a councilor, vice mayor and congressman of 1st Discht, the ability of the young councilor is challenged.
At a young age, he has been put in public service for the first elected captain of the barangay hall in the middle of the decades 2000.
And in May 2010, he got a high vote and got the number 1 spot in the fight for councilor for the first district.
Mayor Orca and Kalagayan is going to be a tandem in service, there is no reason for the city of Caloocan to return again.
