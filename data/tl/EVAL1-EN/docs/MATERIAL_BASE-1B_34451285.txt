A historical cross.

Recently, the victory of the residents of Barangay Krus na Ligas in Quezon City in their protest continues to continue the planned construction of a new Barangay Hall in the historical day.
Many were happy that the construction of the barangay hall did not push through but I believe that what happened is the debate of opinion, arguments of priority and belief, but the majority wants to prevail.
To those who love the QC police, I believe that no one wants to destroy the city and do not want to hurt the people's feelings, which is important to build a new Barangay Hall against what happened to the city hall which is more important to protect and maintain the part of the city that is full of history and considered a sanctuary for those who live here.
The Krus na Ligas is historical and very full of story that can cross the character of the Filipino, do you know that the Krus na Ligas is a former part of the city of Marikina before the QC?
It's not only now that the Krus na Ligas will be put in the controversy, the place that according to our ancestors is a symbol of a wealthy church in the controversial church in the controversial church, but before, they lost a new church surrounding the old church, and then he lost a new church inside the old church.
That is the sad thing that's why you cannot blame the residents who became brave and emotional in their opposition to the city hall and I am sure that he has no intention that will ruin the city hall and I know that he does not have any intention to serve the country.
