The straight path towards Noynoy is a vampire.

The promise of President Benigno Aquino, Nur Misuari, Noynoy and PNoy, is for him to set up the liquid or mockery of the administration of the President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.
As of now, the government of Noynoy has not yet been charged because of the destruction of Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of the Ombudsman in searching for evidence against the culprits.
It is true that Janet Napoles is imprisoned by DOJ but the case is a serious illegal decision and not his involvement on the P10-billion pork barrel scam.
Those who are involved in this anomaly are not yet charged to the Ombudsman despite the truck that was filed against them.
Davaoson Bangquerigo who was arrested by the DOJ is arrested because of the complaint that he violated the law of cheating in the electricity, but the case that he violated, he remains to be a few minutes since he might be tainted by bail.
The Senate were also trying to be imprisoned by the senate but he changed the mind of the senators and he was not able to put up in the Senate and he is just going to file a charge at the Senate.
The people who want to file a case against the Aquino administration remains no case, even the new involved in corruption in the government of Noynoy.
The street whom President Noynoy wants to make the right way is that it seems that the liquid you make will become stronger or poisoned.
The Bureau of Customs said that they know the coler but they do not have evidence against those involved.
Now, will you be surprised why Noynoy's rating of Noynoy went down and down?
