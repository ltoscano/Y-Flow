Benigno WILLIE with PNoy, plague to PDAF.

"My neighbor suddenly laughed at the joke of her bark, the latter said, what was the call from the illness that was full of shape and arrest, but after a few minutes, she got annoyed when he / she got annoyed when he / she got annoyed when he / she got annoyed when he / she got annoyed when he / she got annoyed when he / she got annoyed.
My neighbor said, he didn't get mad at his bark but he got angry at the slow action of the government in giving help to those who were victims of the super typhoon Yolanda "what should be a problem because of the slow action and not to be able to pay attention to President Benigno Aquino III," the neighbor of my neighbor.
Benigno-cadmium that hit the officials of the government because all they prioritize in giving care and help to the victims is all sorts and politicking.
"There is also a call for the attitude of the President to tell the resignation of the word that gets irritated like what" I cannot show anger, "why he goes out of the press conference in Tacloban?
May this illness by the officials of the government to reach the citizens of Eastern Visayas to reach the citizens of Eastern Visayas is the help that our fellow countrymen who have a heart for those who are in need to give them immediately.

Can President Noynoy still say that he can't show anger, maybe even though the magistrates of the Supreme Court did not give him any point, even if some of the magistrates who gave favor of the President did not expect a 14-0-1 fight.
Many are nervous now, aside from the allies of PNoy, it is certain that those who are taking advantage of money from the government will surely end up in the declaration of the SC to file charges, including the private individuals, since the PDAF until 2013 will not end up.
Where will President Aquino get money from his projects, it is also prohibited for the Supreme Court to use the use of money from Malhacan for other things except for the energy that was left or not used as the pork barrel of 2013 in the national treasury.
