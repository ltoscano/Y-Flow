It was strongly denied by Santos Binalera Command-Bagong HRO that was said to be harassed by the members of the Bagong Humalig) in a interview in front of his house in Legazpi City this May 2, 2013, when he was armed with men and suspicion that he was allegedly followed by men when he arrived at a mall.

It is not an issue that it is under Legazpi City on May 2, 2013, and most of all, it is unlikely for him to identify his identity, which is why it is not sure that it is not involved and it is impossible for him to have a conclusion that it is not impossible for him to have a conclusion that it is going to have a conclusion to it.

SBC also clarified especially to Representative Garote, who is not the Filipino people, and only the military, who only have no reason to lose in any kind of illegal drugs of the Bagong Hay Bayan.

It is likely that this is just a gimmick in the campaign of AKB because of the huge percentage that its construction has been revealed to a party-list of rich contractor who is an accomplice of the AFP in its campaign in its campaign against Bagong Hala Bayan.
