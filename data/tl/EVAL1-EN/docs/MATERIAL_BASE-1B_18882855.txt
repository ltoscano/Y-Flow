The BoC is serious.

We cannot say anything and I am impressed by the hard work and seriousness of the officials and employees of the Bureau of Customs.
They are really brave, as proof, he uses every consecutive items that would be allowed to escape the coler of Adelana.
It will also be noticed that the caught smuggled goods in the island will also be noticed since President Noynoy Aquino will be placed in BOC Commissioner Ruffy Biazon.
What kind of products were failed to be smuggled by the thieves there in Adelana to add the Aquino government to make the right taxes.
Rice, onions, fake products and even drugs are being tried to be smuggled through the ports and NAIA.
However, in the leadership of Biazon, "there were no attempt of martial law enforcers because their sales are covered.
Just a few days have passed, the personnel of former Muntinlupa Congressman Biazon will have a score again.
Dry by a 40 million pesos worth of oil and a huge amount was confiscated by the BOC agents who tried to go to Aanana.
Said plates can be reached for two hours and halo is the size of the fog owned by HEXA Tramo from China.
The flow of Porta, selling and food of the king is prohibited due to the possible disease brought by it like a bird flu.
It's because I notice BOC against Bando the orders of Biazon to be alert.
His personnel are inside 24 hours within seven days.
The personnel of Biazon will also help on alert at the x-ray so that they can find out the real contraband found.
It is clear on the day that Biazon and his personnel are really serious in fighting against him!
