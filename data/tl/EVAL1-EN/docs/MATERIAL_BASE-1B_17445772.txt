Two OFW.

According to Pedro Calima, after 300 years, after 300 years, he said she was the saint of Saint Lorenzo Ruiz of Binondo, which also reached 300 years before he became the saint.
They are the very first Overseas Filipino workers, even if the Filipino is not called Filipino in the jurisdiction of the Spaniards and friars or priest.
On the other hand, it is difficult to be called the OFW from Saint Calatagan and Saint Ruiz.
Although they are an OFW, they probably do not have a salary and the families in the Philippines are going to be remitted to their families in the Philippines.
The first OFW in the Philippines is a person called by the Spaniards so he has no salary only because he is just a slave to the colonizers.
Enrique was the first to be the first to be the world of the world, so he / she was in a bath.
Since then, he arrived in India or lying in Spain, and in Cebu, and escaped going to India again until he returned to Spain, when he was not a slave, he returned to this year in Cebu.
But it is not Enrique's call that was called by the world, if not in the Spaniards, where is justice?
One of the OFW is Marcelo H. del Pilar, Jose Rizal, to release a newspaper in Spain.
Since then, he did not receive salary to Rizal and his friends who died and his eyes became a beggar in Spain, the recruiter left and left no fare on his way home.
I felt sorry for Marcelo who was the pet name of Plaridel who was only brought home to the Philippines around 10 years August.
I am a member of the Samahang Plaridel, a group of journalists.
I used to be a student of Plaridel High School, but not once, there was no straight path to those who defeated Plaridel in the hands of Rizal and his allies.
Spain.
Enrique and Plaridel are certain that there is no hope of being the saint.
Especially Ghanaza or Fathers Gomez, Burgos and Zamora.
