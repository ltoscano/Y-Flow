To know the filipino language, I will not forget the help of the books and commerce at me when I wrote a lot of times when I wrote at me and when I wrote the projects of my projects in the classroom.

My knowledge was a big contribution to reading the reading material that we are watching over, and all of the novels, I continue to cook my feelings to become patriotic and creative in life, I woke up and I reached the many success in my life.

I am just sad, because the lively state of defending them is gone, since the television and to watch on top, most of our youth have lost their attention, especially to our youth, those who introduce themselves as our real tradition, art and culture.

Nevertheless, I am worried because there are still several real Filipinos when they try hard to bring back to the commerce at the filipino masses, and I'm proud that those who are able to get back to the development of our country are extraordinary and I'm proud of those that they have done for the comics of America, especially in Marty Go.

For someone who is Gerry Alungani, a few of Preso, Depcom Ariel Anuar, Mabuhay po!

People like you are the real needs of our country and thank you very much to you.
