We can thank you: Thank President Noynoy Aquino!
It was announced that June 24, 2016 one week, and President Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino III passed away after six-years of leadership in our country, according to the close acquaintances of PNoy, he is very eager to take a vacation and return to normal lives.
We all know that in 2010, PNoy has no ambition to run as President of our country, but because of the call of time and for the meantime, he will bet for our country.

Can we say that his leadership became successful? For me, yes.

This is not perfect because there are still many problems but he did what he can for his time.
One of the things that I can say is his campaign against corruption, let us just look at the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and the Department of Education (DepEd) and you can also give an award to their leaders of PhilHealth and you can also give an award to their leaders in different hospitals in the whole country.
Before, your money will be consumed in order to treat yourself and your loved ones but now, PhilHealth is here to help our treatment.
Aside from this, the Aquino administration became successful with the persuasion of tourists in our country, to the leadership of Department of Tourism (DOT) Secretary Mon Jimenez, the number of tourists visited us from different countries.
Because of the improvement of tourism, there are also a number of jobs that have been visited in our country, but it is also here where Palawan, Davao and Cebu are also here, Palawan, Davao and Cebu, which are often visited by tourists who want to see the beauty of our country.
PNoy has become a lot of success but in the next column, these are just going to report to our president, thank you very much for you to give proper and honest service for every Filipino!
