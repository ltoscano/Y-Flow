Mar Roxas, all of these?

Interior Secretary Mar Roxas cannot stop his ambition to become the president of the country.
Just imagine, there is a foreigner who's political covetous, who is Paul Boatad, to change, to change and push for his image to the people?
Anzon is averted to you Mr. Palapal, isn't you lost faith in your PR team?
After all, you can spend money for Boatad, the price of service is multimillion pesos, only one month for you run off or a month for those running for your market in Cubao.
As a poor person, I regret all the funds of Boatad in a lot of doing the poor and if you will use it for them, you do not need the money to be paid by Boatad and PR Men.
It's too bad for you to go back to the people, it is natural and it is normal for you to get along with Mr. market even if you know the filipino masses, you will just look at Eve, "if it is not yet defeated by Eve," in the election 2010, President he / she will be defeated.
The voters of the rally in Makati City first started with you when he cursed at a sharp blade, former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (PGMA), because they are mad at her before, he is not a president but on the issue of corruption.
A lot of March.
With what you want to be resent, even if you want to be ill, even the territory of the National Disaster Authority (NHA) that you want to be a secret, is that you do not have a secret to your friends Benigno Aquino III.
And, and, Mister Roxas, this is for sure, in the coming presidential election in 2016, believe and not, it is up to your life that Noynoy will push you but remember the election in 2010 - a series of Manila.
There is no big amount that can help in your political ambition in 2016, no experts, local or foreigners will push you, whether you're only one and your character, you are the only ones who can do it.
How are these now?
