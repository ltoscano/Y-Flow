Chiz "epal."

We are worried, his fellow Bicolano who is Senator Chiz Escudero.
"That is my presumption of the issue of" libel "where Senator Chiz is one of the approval of the approval!
In the hope of Chiz that he did not notice him about the "libel" when he approved the "cylinder tube" it appears that the first idol of the senator went up.
How many proposed laws have been approved by Senator Chiz that he is not reading a serious issue?
We will be elected to the Senate because we believe in your capacity to evaluate the proposed laws, then you should just give in order?
Is it that Chiz is very busy with her show of Kris Aquino and her romance with Heart Evangelista?
Now that Chiz is saying that in the opening of the Senate, he examined it.

Chiz have forgotten that when it was approved by the "cylinder tube, and PNoy immediately passed the only Supreme Court to dismiss it on the declaration of this declaration."
The only cure for the Senate and Congress can be implemented before it will be implemented.
Its extra fun in the Philippines!
And how many years have passed before the amendment to happen?
Chiz knows this, to collect it, and butting in!
