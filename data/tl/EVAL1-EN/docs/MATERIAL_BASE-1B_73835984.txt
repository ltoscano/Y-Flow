Corruption of the traffic, Colonel Lee.

It has been almost a month since we first wrote the alleged possession of Col. Lee in the coughs in Manila but until now it seems blind, according to Chief Supt. Leonardo Espina.
From non-stop reports that some policemen came to us from NCRPO, it reached to the NCRPO.
The staff of Col. Lee made three million pesos.
Also according to the complaint, Colonel Lee was allegedly sent to General Espina.
The truth is, we don't just believe in the said activity, Colonel Lee who is a famous "child" (bagman?) of General Espina.
What I wonder about is to make sure that Espina cannot be investigated about this complaint against Lee?
What if this complaint is not true?
On the other hand, what if it's true?
If, according to them, why are they only allowed to allow all the chief in the whole country to have a direct effect on the toll fee in their AOR?
So that the organization of the Philippine National Police will finally be destroyed!
"What may you think, that, the PNP Chief Director General Alan Peter Cayetano that was kidnapped?" Isn't it?
Entice the President.
Here is it, General Purisima, what is happening to your AOR.
Your warning is not effective for corrupt policemen.
According to the complaints of jeepney drivers in Metro Manila and nearby areas like Bulacan, if they will extort, it is just like that.
The police is already organized and knows how to use the police for them to buy.
If the drivers are senseless and with the drivers, the Kotong is also being investigated.
But they were stabbed, a mosquito nets, the drivers, so they can earn more from the commission.
How much was the commission of the police from the Land Transportation Office?
Here is the vices of the arrogant police who loves to collect payment for the sidewalks where the Traffic Management Group is expensive because they are not an ordinary police.
Hmmmp!
