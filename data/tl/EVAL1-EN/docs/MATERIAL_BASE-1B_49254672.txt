Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte will be killed by five members of "Tristan (Office" who allegedly stole more than P14million in the treasury of the said city? This is the truth when Duterte himself said that he is guilty "Jane M. Pagued, Anesza, Anacorita, Anacorita, Anacorita, Anzon in Mesa. Mesa.
The five were allegedly put in work and there was an investigation of three others.
The committee made the investigation to investigate after the City Tanim-Carnapping Unit said that there is a missing $4,334.68 pesos that should be seen by the city from January to June of 2013.
It turns out that Duterte is not there, although he was robbed under his nose under his nose?
Duterte has expressed several times, even in the Senate that he will be killed, he will be killed, he will be killed, he is just dreaming, and he is still pleased by the frequent senators like Cynthia Villar and Jinggoy Estrada.
Only Justice Secretary Leila de Lima and the Human Rights Depcom Ann Torres is currently fighting against the current administration and talk against the famous brain of Duterte, the self-mindedness of Duterte, a judge or executioner. "
This is the truth: From the lack of action or reaction, it turns out how the senators are useless, just like the officials of the organization, judge, judge, "Atong" who should be leading in pushing the "rule of law, what is what the religions have been doing for a good manners!
Many thought, including the children who watched TV, are included in the radio and will be able to read in the radio and will be able to read the law of Duterte, that it is right to boast that he will kill a person.
Let's go back to the question: Mayor Rodrigo Duterte will also kill the five personnel of "Tristan (Office" who was allegedly being attacked by more than 113 million pesos of money in the city?
Let us see this is the truth!
