Skakel and Mayor passed away.

The news that reached me earlier this morning of Christmas is already dead.
Heart attack was the cause of the death of former Mayor Juancho Mathay.
The city is mourning.
Like the city that has been applied for a long time, the political life of KWF can be colorful.
He became a vice mayor, bliging and became a congressman.
The Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) became a vice governor.
Many of the local government of QC have passed through teaching and training of Mayor Mathay.
Even the former mayor and now Speaker Sonny Belmonte showed the meaningful contribution of Umali in the politics of the QC and the country.
A strong foundation of the QC name, Mathay, and the legacy of Mayor Ukol Talumpa.
Two children of Mayor Ernest Mercado is also in politics of the QC.
Even if already old, there are still many who were surprised by the sudden death of Mayor Orca.
It was reported that it was reported that he was sick because he managed to run as a candidate last election.
According to his son, the death of the mayor is also calm, which is almost according to his calm personality.
He was not complained about any illness because the family was still studying during Christmas eve.
The next day, it is fine.
Mayor was supposed to watch a TV like she was accustomed to it but he was able to go to the bathroom.
The news is saddening because it is Christmas day.
In the spread of news, different from the description of the people about the mayor is different.
Always happy, always smiling and calmly speaks.
This is the quick action that the residents will review, if you will ask how they remember Mayor Juancho Mathay.
Always, what Mayor is smiling is still smiling, that's why his campaign was entrusted to the Sevidal in QC.
For him, the flawless, peaceful, satisfied, and happy QC.
Rest and peace, Gamu, thank you in your service to the QC.
