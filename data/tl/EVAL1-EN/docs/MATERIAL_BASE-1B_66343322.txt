I was born and grew up in the streets of Pandacan, Manila, Lydia Labuan de Castro - in a simple house that would be home to his family and refuge of the activists for their time, which is where the meeting with his wife Aundrey head de Castro in the first part of the decades of 80, for Kilusang May Uno are conducting a meeting.
In the middle of that moment, Lydia also became active in the movement while time passes, they felt that their lives are complicated because in 1988, their family was able to save up one of their children who worked in a different country.
Because he still needs to earn, he memorized his head, selling cigarette in the morning, and balut, he was only left alone in the house in the morning yesterday at the 19th of October 1988, he went home to one sibling in the nearby Mido Island.
The next week was like a nightmare that happened to Lydia to Lydia; as if she can hear arnis and gunshots in the middle of the evening, he felt that they were not safe because of exhaustion from searching and thinking, he chose to return to Pandacan.
Years passed and the effect of the disappearance of Saure is still felt not only by Lydia but to the entire family of De Castro, until now, it seems that the spirit of his father and his friends are still visiting the decades, 80, a small group of former activists and relatives of the people.
Now, more than fifty-four years, she said that she has accepted what happened to her husband, she said she has no requested any help, instead, what the people like him left are the only things that she left, those who want to understand each other.
For now, there is almost no trace of trace from their home when they went to different precinct to search for a few minutes to look for a few seconds, until it seemed that he was left alone and his memories were left behind.
