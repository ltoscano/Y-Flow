PNoy is the biggest tragedy for the Filipino.

Until now, I was surprised with what happened to me in Tacloban City.
Until now, I still do not hear any news from my relatives who are affected.
Going through prayer, I hope that all of them survived.
What if this happens in the most crowded place, example in Metro Manila.
No one can say when what happened in Samar and Leyte but we are expecting to happen again because of a big change in our climate.
As they say, the super typhoon Yolanda (Daang Matuwid) is the worst in the history of the world.
We should prepare.
Typhoon Yolanda "is like the first natural calamity that we cannot avoid to avoid our big sin in nature, but other calamity, we can prepare for what we want.
But how can we make a strong calamity if this is a government of Noynoy Aquino who said that the biggest tragedy in the Philippines is showing no preparedness to the natural disaster in the country.
After typhoon Yolanda, many were found dead but more were saved up now by the help.
There are still many critics who have not yet reached for help.
They fear that after they be saved from Yolanda, they might not be able to be saved from the tragedy brought by this administration which is too high, useless and more organized when brought to the politics.
The failure which caused heavy hunger from some areas where the victims do not see any hope, "because our leaders do not know what to do.
This tragedy will be placed under PNoy, many have been placed in mind by many who almost died from hunger, lack of homes in the middle of the heat and downpour of rain.
