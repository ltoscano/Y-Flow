Gorospe said they are preparing for their Christmas television series April 22, 2016.
Meow, Altaserv paid for the news of Alden Richards and Jennylyn Mercado who is about to dress to the Filipino to be able to go to the Filipino Worker (Dr. Love?
Alden Richards.
We were able to talk to each other so that the reaction of most fans of Allyxon is not good because they have been asking for a long time on GMA 7 that could have been given the soap of Alden and Maine.
But we think, that it is more important for Jennylyn, to be part of Maine, aside from that, they are holding on Maine, which is why they might have a business plan with the Phenomenal Bostar of Eat Bulaga.
We asked the camp of Alden, they say they can't say anything because it was first seen on the movie that Alden and Maine had done.
After legally con, they already discussed the jeans and some details of the shooting, but they did not think about it because they were still unknown.
They say they have not made a movie title yet because they are still talking about it.
It is said that the story is too dominant and they make sure that Allyxon.
They do not want to deny the shooting of a movie since it came out in social media.
Upon arriving at the drama that happened in GMA 7, there is no longer a case for our knowledge, Jennylyn is not able to renew the contract on GMA 7 that will end on May.
There is also nothing confirmed if KBS Aquino has given the rights of Dr. Love, in The Stars, which is why he is still talking about it.
For the camp of Jennylyn, it is better about her movie to John Lloyd, Jango or the 3 of the US to talk about it.
There is still no final talk about what the drama that he will do after giving birth to coercion.
