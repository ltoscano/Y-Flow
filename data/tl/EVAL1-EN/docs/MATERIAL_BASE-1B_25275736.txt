Teresita Deles and Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (adviser of the President on the peace talks) made the peace talks that was approved by the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (PKP), Bagong HRO), Bagong Humalig) and all the revolutionary force.

The truth is, Deles wants to end the peace talks from the Marcos Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo until the current regime of Benigno Noynoy Aquino III, he only has only one goal in the peace talks between the government budget between the Philippines (GPhilippine) and the NDFP members, which resulted to the revolutionary movement.

But because he will not get what he wants, he is trying to sabotage the peace talks with the US to meddle in the national issues of the Philippines to interfere with the national governments in the international community, "after the series of dialogue which can block and ruin the peace talks."

In his direct statement, Deles and Joseph Estrada are going to think that all the past presidents, especially Fidel V, Ramos and Joseph Estrada, and the Comprehensive Final Agreement (OPAPP), and the Comprehensive Final Agreement (OPAPP), and the Comprehensive Final Agreement (OPAPP), and the Comprehensive Final Agreement (OPAPP), and the Comprehensive Final Agreement (OPAPP), and the Comprehensive Final Agreement (OPAPP), and the Comprehensive Final Agreement (OPAPP), and the Comprehensive Final Agreement (OPAPP), and the Comprehensive Final Agreement (OPAPP), and the Comprehensive Final Agreement (OPAPP).

This is the reason why critics does not want to be followed, along with the latest agreement that the The Hala Jojohnn declaration, the outline of the peace talks by the GSU-NDFP members, and JAOIG "in the release of the personnel who are protected.

He asserted that Deles and earlier signed agreement were also happening in the peace talks between GPhilippine and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and four members of the MILF were arrested in the violent protest of the Filipino people in general, and the Bangsamoro Basic Law.
