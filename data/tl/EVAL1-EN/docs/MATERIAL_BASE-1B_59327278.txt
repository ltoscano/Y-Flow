Cayetano and Ochoa, Acuzar.

It seems that the fight between the Cayetano and Binay will become worse because no one will agree to anyone who will just give them to Fort Bonifacio when simply to be given.
This is clear in the consecutive incidents of being rude, especially every one does not want to raise his father because it is a big part and money is at stake.
It is certain that Cayetano will also do all means to not lose them from Fort Bonifacio because the 75 percent of the funds of Taguig is coming from this place.
In a short word, the group of couple Allan and Lanie Cayetano are going to go to a different word because if it happened that it has been returned to Fort Bonifacio in Makati, he will surely fight back at Fort Bonifacio in Makati.
The said issue is complicated but only one is sure here, money, force and fight to the sympathy of the media on the top of the media, even on the street, and do better if Allan Cayetano is allegedly good.
Number of number.
It looks like the style of Executive Secretary Jojo Ochoa and his brother-in-law, Jerry Acuzar, owner of San Jose Builders and was able to receive an award in the time of Ate Geng for the rent of 2000-hectare building in Baba, Palawan.
It's because it's a big thing to explain to the public of Ochoa and Acuzar, because it is part of the said rent on the appearance of GMA, but it is not allowed by Malacanang.
If we can remember it, PNoy said that all the Midnight Cabinet would be neglected and in fact he did not consider the release of former Chief Justice Renato Corona.
It is also clear in the statement of Jun Loiz City, a lower part, the government loses in the agreement of Acuzar, and the Philvolcs because from the former P500 per kilo of rent, it was made up to 100 pesos.
This is where Acuzar and Ochoa should not respond because PNoy is the pitiful ones in this issue because he is not satisfied with the Tuwid na Daan in the current leadership.
