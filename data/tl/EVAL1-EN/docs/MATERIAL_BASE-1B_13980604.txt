Congratulations!

Crawford (commemoration of Santa Marta) "We Talk 'Day, I planned to be the US."

The room will also be annoyed and fixing of books, but it is still not right for me to go there, but my plan is still not right, but when we are here, the role of time in a life will not happen again, but the truth is that it is not true that the time is not happening.

Our time is to measure our movement if this is a chance to identify the past, the present and the future is our movement and the future.

But in this movement, I hope that how important is we understand the movement of God, Marta, we can be considered a person who is always busy with the life of Jesus Christ, we should not stop the past but we can't learn from it.

The next day is still not there but we can use it as a guide in our journey if there is now one who should be treated as an important.
