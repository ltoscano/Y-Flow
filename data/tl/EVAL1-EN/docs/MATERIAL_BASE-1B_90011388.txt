Cesar's COLLECaba.

Books, jewelry, with toys, toys, clothes, hats and many others, that are only a few of the things that we put and give importance to us, what is the reason why some of our fellow countrymen are quickly watering?
In San Francisco, USA, I met Cesar Magat, Pinoys and they did not want to buy shoes.
In America, Cesar grew up and studied, one of the things received by my attention is his hobby and passion in making a basket with Jordan-budol Gang, who was famous in a basket with a basket with a basket with a basket.
According to Cesar, he was only in a high school when he was able to catch up by the Jordan-budol Gang, and if at first, it reached more than a few hundred pesos, which according to him, he did not use it but only for a few hundred pesos.
Different colors and style of Jordan were different, which is why when there is a new decision coming out of the market, Cesar is one of the collector who are pointing at each other, especially if the supply is limited, especially if the supply is limited.
Aside from the limited number of Jordan, which can be bought, it is a bit expensive for a pair of shoes that sometimes reaches up to three thousand pesos or more than the price, which is why when the price starts with his hobby, they have to be able to get a part of his hobby to be able to pay for his hobby.
Cesar explained to me that it is a unique happiness and he / she can see his feelings if he sees his collection.
Every bait will have importance and importance to every collector like him because this may affect or form a part of time in the race of their idol, Michael Jordan.
For Cesar, although it can be said that he is considered a hobby, he does not care about it because he knows he is not doing anything wrong and he does not feel any person for his happiness.
