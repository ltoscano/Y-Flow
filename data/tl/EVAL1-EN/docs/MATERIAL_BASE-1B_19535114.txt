It is difficult to be.

It seems that the problem coming to President Benigno Aquino III is not yet finished because the pork barrel scam did not end, but it was followed immediately by the conflict in Zamboanga City where a few years of hostages were given to the members of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) of Nur Misuari.
This is what PNoy is facing in the head of PNoy because aside from the involvement of the members of the opposition, it cannot be denied that he also has members who are part of the said scam, who are really part of the said scam, who are really addicted to the filipino people.
Because aside from the involvement of the opposition of the opposition, including Jinggoy Estrada, and Bongbong Marcos, the name of DILG Mar Roxas also has been involved in a boasts that has also gave P5 million MT), which also gave P5 million pesos.
Malacanang cannot hide that the order and economy of the country is what is happening in Zamboanga City because the entire Philippines is affected by this.
Because aside from the downfall of peace and order in Mindanao, it also affected the whole country because the entire economy of the state is shocked especially that this is the whole world's perspective.
In a short word, it looks like PNoy is not able to finish this word because of any anomaly he will discover, and it will surely be exposed to the people because majority of his personnel and allies are also included in the greedy men.
