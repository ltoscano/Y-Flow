It is not bad to remember, every arrival of February 22-25, the usual action of the people before reaching the sky is seen in the sky, it seems that the dictator needed to go back to the sky, as well as the dictator, together with the family and the main of the four-year-old Australian.

What should the citizens should thank EDSA 1?
Is this just guiding it or the real revolution?
After taking advantage of the tank and soldiers of the state, while we are emotional in any danger and will become emotional in any danger of life, after having a bloody encounter, the dictator did not get back to the country and even went back to the country.
What is the spirit of EDSA 1 that should be remembered and celebrate every year?
After all of all, from Cory's regime, it turns out that EDSA 1 is just a reflection of the continuous abuse of the rules in the society such as well as the covetousness of foreign interests, and others who are full of sweat and blood of the filipino masses.
Saddening, it's not right, in the book shown by EDSA 1, the thousands of ordinary citizens in the world are still small, not included in the book of our country, not included in the book of our country, just wipe with the feet and butt of the people and the filipino masses.
It is possible that EDSA 1 may wake up for a long time that is patriotic and brought about the awareness and the militants of many people against any kind of justice and abuse of the power of the Marcos regime, until now, he is still asking the real national welfare?
It is clear that the protagonist is only united in EDSA 1 to bring Marcos to the position but if examined, they will be able to support the welfare of the country and the filipino masses to be freed, at last, of an outing at the welfare of the country and the filipino masses to be released, even if it is a little bit of justice.
If the EDSA 1 can be considered a revolution - it is not like a heavy movie, Fidel Castro and Cuba said, what is important to the revolution is not the only unity, but the basis of unity. "
And in EDSA 1, it is clear that it is clear that the stars here are only united in the power together with the grace of the most powerful citizens from then until now when the bad regime was left behind, it was replaced by bad, or more than bad spirits.
If you think about it, and when examined, the dictator might not be able to escape immediately and there is still a need to take care for the welfare of Uncle Sam in the Philippines because it is very angry that Marcos is not only a puppy of the filipino masses, but also the poor people that was about to be hit by Marcos.
The repeated condition of the country is ripe from the right condition of the country for a true revolution.
Since then, until now, even if there is EDSA 2 and failed EDSA 3, it is said that based on many incidents, it is said that based on many incidents, it is always favorable for many incidents, and those who are involved in the destruction of the country and the Filipino people from the regime of Tita Cory until now, the essence of EDSA 1 is being returned to the country.
First, the corrupt leader of the society has not changed and is only being played by a few groups of people in the government, and even if the national leaders of the government, and even worse, the national leadership of foreign interests, and even worse, the national leadership of the national economy towards more hunger and poverty of ordinary citizens.
Even if it is more bad, even if the dictator is kicked out of power, he has returned to the release of power - and now, it should not be determined, because there is an ally of the current leaders of the country, because they are continuously being treated, only one color, they are taking advantage of cases in power and opportunists.
Naturally, the filipino masses might be very pitiful for the complicated grace that is smooth, as well as the blessings given to our society through different kinds of fraud and cowards.
What should be remembered and thank EDSA 1?
While those in power are continuously being monitored by false gods and king in power in the society the spirit of EDSA 1, and it is still ongoing and it is said that justice and justice will continue for the real freedom and freedom.
