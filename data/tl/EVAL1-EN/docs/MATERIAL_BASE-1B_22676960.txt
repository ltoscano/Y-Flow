The pork barrel scam might be imprisoned at the pork barrel scam.

The illegal pork barrel that the name is the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) will start the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) which will be started by Cory Aquino in his former name Misibis Development Assistance Fund (CDS).
The Supreme Court said, the use of funds from Malampton (Palawan) Fund) and the Presidential Social Assistance Fund (PAGCOR) has been utilized for the income of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR).
Because of this, the Supreme Court ordered him to file a case and of course, he was imprisoned, the local government official and the person who benefited from the pork barrel that reached the time of Cory Aquino, Fidel Ramos, Erap Estrada, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo until President Noynoy Aquino.
But will they be jailed?
If Noynoy Aquino will not be impeached, it's likely that in the next election, he will be charged with, what Senator Ralph Recto said.
This is probably the reason why Noynoy suddenly woke up at the height of the relief operations in Visayas and were able to go back to Malacanang.
In a unanimous decision that is like a memorandum in boxing, the Supreme Court ordered to file a case against all those involved in the Kennon Road in Manila, including Janet Napoles and senators and congressmen.
Who will implement this order? The Department of Justice (DOJ) against the leadership of Leila de Lima or even an ordinary person?
"He should have been hit by a hit," said De Lima.
What now Noynoy is being involved in the pork barrel scam?
With the number of cases being charged, he will be imprisoned at Veterans Memorial Hospital or in Sta. Rosa, Laguna?
