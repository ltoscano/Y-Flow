Political dyed.

The majority of our citizens are difficult, that's why political dynasty are our country, and it is okay for the citizens to listen because of political dynasty are they going near the time of need.
It is true that many political dynasty are the animals, but for a person who is poor, that is okay even if they are helping the poor, will they be able to go to work with the poor people?
Mayor has a son of vice mayor or he is congressman, one of his son who is a captain of Barangay Chairman, congressman, has a senator, or a mother, or mother who are also congressman, or a senator also.
And their dynasty are not end here, the whole family is in the government, all of them are political agenda like the President or for the friends of a President.
In our Constitution, political dynasty are not true, but it is not true that President Cory Aquino said, it is up to the Congress to make a law about political dynasty, that is the reason why there is political dynasties from the Constitution.
The making of law regarding this is natural, not to make a law against political dynasty are the congressman and senators what they are, crazy?
Our political dyed to our country will only be finished if majority of us have money to support their needs, like their own food, work, education and we need to be smart in voting for our officials.
Why will you not vote for a thief?
In many places that have been forgotten, their political dynasty are these, these are many complaints from the people who are not yet in position.
Why is Senator Edgardo Angara, who has a son for senator, why is she said that he will run for senator, and why is Ed Angara, will run for presidency?
Why is JV Ejercito (that now that his name) is now running for senator while his brother-in-law is also a senator now?
You asked.
