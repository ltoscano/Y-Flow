It has been a few months since the historic 14-0 Supreme Court released this kind of decisions to the Filipino farm of Hacienda Luisita, (2), which have been used by Cojuangco-15 million pesos, and they were not able to pay the strengthening of the farmers (NPA), but until now, there is no implemented implementation.
In many times the opinion of the President needs, the tongue of Noynoy Cojuangco-Aquino has become commendable.
While the whole town is focused on the issue of the removal of Corona, the execution of Cojuangco-Aquino continues to escape the Supreme Court.
This December, an answer was passed by Cojuangco-Aquino, they are ready to share the land, but (1), they will just pay the farmers in the land that they have to pay, and if they will pay a 1.3 billion like the Supreme Court, they should pay a 1.3 billion like what the Supreme Court should pay for each other.
Last January and February, there have been added to the military forces within the hacienda, therefore, the Filipino Workers who have been occupied in Barangay Balite and Texas, placed the 500 hectares of land in Barangay Balite and Texas, set a law which is set to be replaced with a lot of land for five years only.
On the first week of March, when the guards of RCBC from the members of RCBC from the members of RCBC, those in the fields of Hacienda Luisita, those who have been defending their rights in the place, can be seen as the right fence in the farm which was stopped by the Filipino farm to build.
Second week of March, the captain of eleven barangays in Hacienda Luisita, signed, that is why the barangay captain in the presence of the military inside their respective barangays, which is as if there is no military, could not allow the captain's response to the progressive countries of the community.
These past few days, the seven Filipino workers were arrested in defending them.
Their case?
Malana chief.
