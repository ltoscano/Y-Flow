Gambling of Batangas City and warning of Brillantes.

It is starting to be the chairman of the Commission on Elections, Sixto Brillantes.
Because aside from Governor Ejercito in Laguna, there are politicians in some places which are scheduled to research because of violation of the laws of the election.
If you think about it, it is really right that these evil politicians will really be schooled so that their violation of laws will not be shameless every time there is election.
That is why Brillantes and his co-inmates are having a different colors as well because of the millions of intelligence fund, "they were asked by PNoy in the past election.
It was the millions tasted by the Palace, I mean, was given to them by the Palace!
I just want to tell you, "there is a good thing that you are waiting on, especially about the issue that it is not expensive but you should also do it!
Burp!

We do not want to judge the PNP Provincial Director of Batangas that is Senior Superintendent JO-ABB) in relation to the complaints that we received about the widespread illegal gambling in the said province.
According to the complaints of Burdado, the gambling in the towns of Balayan, Nasrudin bo, in an an an, Calatagan and Calaca in Batangas.
As a matter of fact, we are trying hard to stop the mind of the said illegal gambling that is Pad Bautista, "the provincial director," because the provincial director said that because they themselves are the responsible for the said illegal gambling.
Colonel, I will not believe these complaints at the same time, I will force myself to believe that you are not the brains of the said illegal gambling so you should also prove that I am right.
They will take advantage of the illegal gambling of Bautista in the said places!
