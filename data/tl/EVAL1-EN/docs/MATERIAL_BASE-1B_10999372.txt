It is the government of PNoy that is useless.

Yesterday, all Rubie Garcia brought his loved ones, friends, neighbors, his colleagues in the media and many others.
Prior to this, he was given a Lalaurie of Independence Day in Mendiola in front of Malacanang.
We found the iron fist of Malacanang to be closed and became a symbol of the ears and face the eyes of the government on the call of the chamen and the people for justice for the incessant in our society.
It is not just like this.
The diie was centered to the Rubie which happened yesterday.
But we are also included with the first who risked their lives for the people, particularly the journalists.
Through the death of our colleagues, it is very painful and very kind, our fight for some of the most important rights of the citizens.
The right to live and right for free journalism and media.
Death of PNoy.
We are not forcing the most of the majority who were killed to be amen in the past administrations, including the pitiful victims of the Ampatuan massacre.
But we just want to protect the killings in the time of President Benigno Aquino III.
We had hope that all the murdered in his position will be given justice but it is the opposite of what we are expecting from, in his time we feel the urge of death from our motherland.
Those who were killed.
Here are Bro, those who were killed during PNoy's time and it is painful to think that the number of these are increasing.

Monument and straight path.
We brought out this list in our column as the monument and honor of our colleagues in the profession that was mercilessly murdered since the Tuwid na Daan "will be held.
The Tuwid na Daan is the full of death for being amen and fully pretending to be hit in the freedom of speech and media.
And it is really surprising that we have not heard anything that is in power, to correct the Lelegantly and I am BE. "Tuwid na Daan".
Almost boils.
Until now, the government of PNoy is almost not favored to solve the killing.
In the 24 media killing, it has been around 4: 00 in the court, there are a few who reach the Department of Justice while it is still unknown to the majority of cases.
Because of this, the freedom of the killed people who killed their lives is like that.
Until when will there really be light from these issues that have been placed under the lives of journalists?
