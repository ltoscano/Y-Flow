Calinisan, the rice in Bohol and Cebu are assured.

Many are observing that the Lord seems to have a sign on why it seems that the country seems to go through many heavier challenges.
After the consecutive typhoons, which resulted to the flooding and death of many of our countrymen, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake in Visayas and Mindanao this Tuesday.
Based on the last reports, up to 70 people died and more than 200 were wounded due to the said quake.
Because of the volume of accidents, many of our government officials should think that they need to straighten out the truth that they are passing through.
But although there are officials who are really corrupt and corrupt, there are still some who are similar to NFA Administrator Midas Calinisan, who are really destroying his job.
This is despite the incessant defamation and criticisms done against him by his critics who desire his position.
That's why when the earthquake hit, Calayag of his personnel ordered to make sure that the rice they give are enough in the affected areas to avoid the history buying which may result to the turmoil.
"We know that in these times, the role done by the government agencies is heavy, including NFA, to ensure that the government is here who are ready to help and give to the government they need," said Calayag.
"It is most important that we give an assurance that there will be no obstacle in the supply of rice and other food, so that it can be easier for the victims to recover from the nightmare that they experienced," he added.
"We just want to inform our fellow countrymen who are always here in order to fulfill its mandate to make sure that the supply of rice is enough for other opportunity and even in any situation," Administrator Fr.
I hope that all leaders are like Calayag of those who do not think of anything but the welfare of the citizens and not make their own position in position.
