That was responded to Commissioner Ruffy Biazon, arrested again with Comm.

The millions worth of onions caught by the Bureau of Customs (BOC) recently was no joke.
Up to P14M is the value of the chemicals caught by BOC from China which may affect the local industry who will be leaving.
The smuggled out of 40 million pesos, which can be bought from 40 percent, and inconservation in RSG Marketing were stopped by the people of Customs Commissioner Ruffy Biazon in Camp P.
Well, if BOC is not active now in management of Commissioner Ruffy Biazon, it is certain that the industry of farm is really full, particularly the rice, onions, and other kinds of crops.
Because before, the said product of the said product is very widespread because of this not being serious with the leaders of Customs.
You see, the importation of onions is strictly prohibited because we also have a lot of different fields but they still make it way for the covetousness of these to BOC.
It is now being said that BOC is already different under Biazon, who will not succeed in being observant of the BOC on any attempted smuggling of products.
That's why it's not surprising why in the management of Biazon, the public trusts his leadership.
In the last survey of the Social Weather Station (SWS) about government agencies that should be trusted, the people's trust in BOC will hit a big percentage.
That is why Raul Concepcion is very confident because instead of forcing him to push for his personal behavior in politics, he should first prioritize serving Customs.
That is why Biazon is good.
