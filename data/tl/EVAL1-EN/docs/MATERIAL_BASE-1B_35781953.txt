It was not just about.

Every time the celebration of Christmas arrives, the celebration of our Catholic Church on the birth of Jesus Christ, the debate about the truth or not the true day of the birth of the so-called Christ, our christians.
In a articles of Jaime Licauco in a newspaper, a famous columnist said that it is said to be a true story, why there was no document in history that can prove that Jesus was born in the dates.
According to Mister Licauco, the age of 25 is a celebration of what happened during the first time before Jesus was born.
The celebration of Dalia is for a tribute of what they are headed.
The said celebration of Dalia in the end of May 25 and because the said celebration can be followed by the first catholic during these dates of Christmas, but it was not born when Jesus was born.
For the other Catholic Church, this kind of revealing is offensive.
Of course, many of us are thinking that some of us are not respect the days of Christmas that we consider as sacred.
But a priest said in a mass, which was also a celebration in the first time of the end of the long time of darkness and the start of light.
That's why even if she does not deny the angle, like Licauco, the priest said that the time of the birth of Jesus that for the catholic is to watch 25 is a invitation of going to the light from the dark, one liter.
Even before the true date of the birthday of Jesus, what is important is our faith as christians and on Christmas day, that the date for us is to watch 25, we can even get to our christian faith as catholics.
Happy Easter to everyone.
Hopefully, all the blessing of crystal-king in the celebration of this day will be all good.
