A simple award and reward was waiting for Hagupin in the Senate after failing to win the silver medal of the toll fee in Rio de Janghai, Brazil.
Senate President Aquilino "Koko" Pimentel III focused the recognition given by the Senate to Diaz any day after he cut the 20 years of drought in the Olympics in the Olympics.
"Based on the list of the Armed Forces of the Country, a Libra Girl that it is very hard to be a person in the Dream Team Her, the same time to be the inspiration to our US to CHigher Education," according to Senate President.

Last Thursday, Diaz returned to the country and faced President Rodrigo Duterte where he reached P2 million check.
It will also receive P5 million from the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) and house a lot from a real Estate firms.
Aside from the recognition of the Senate, we are waiting for the "traslacion" of boxing ring and Senator Manny Pacquiao.
It can be recalled that Pacquiao promised P5 million to anyone who will go home to the gold medal in the Olympics but it did not give a statement on how much is the silver or a horrific act.
