Chaotic foreign policy.

The majority of our government are very unfortunate.
Mar Roxas is the secretary of the Interior and Local Government but he was appointed by President Noy in the talks in the conflicts of Spratings and South China Sea.
Why is it that the secretary of Foreign Affairs that Albert del Rosario was assigned in talking with the Chinese in Beijing, this is just a prediction that maybe Del Rosario will be put under a DILG.
The leadership of PNoy is really complicated, Senator Antonio Trillanes is really confused on this discussion on this conversation with Trillanes who is personally called by PNoy and not the ambassador to China, Sonia Aviles, or Del Rosario himself.
The Philippines is really confident with this kind of PNoy.
Before, Jesse Robredo was the secretary of DILG but only half was held by Undersecretary Rico Puno, which was the name of PNoy and not to Jesse.
Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile (JPE) said, Trillanes is mad at Del Rosario, friends and former employee of Manny V. Pangilinan (MVP).
Trillanes was said to be the fault of Trillanes in talking with the Chinese, but it was not allowed to talk when MVP will talk to them about the joint forces of Rep Bank in Palawan.
You are really confused with the warnings of MVP: I will just go home to Hong Kong if you are in danger.
Pad, not sure, Amistoso, Boyet Gonzales, majority leader of the House of Representatives.
Wow, this is really the weight of AOIL. She intervened in the hearing in the Senate, in Malacanang and to the Department of Foreign Affairs.
Aspe, PNoy said, it is right for you to comment at the Spratch was enough for us to comment at the Sprattire for us to buy oil for us.
Really, but no one will follow the order of PNoy, they still continue to arrest them, and now, the Martial Law was still set to play in TV during 1972.
