Beauty wrapped in brother Rom July 18, 2016 with Kuya Rom.
Just hide me with the name Hector.
He already showed me the pictures of his girlfriend, but I did not say it to him, but I did not tell him that he was in a relationship with him, because I had a lot of things with him, because she has a lot of things that he is in relationship with, her friends, and has an attitude that is not good.
My friend, who, of my friend, I do not want to be a victim of this woman, and she might get hurt because I am worried about her when I see a love in love for him as well as the woman.
Should I tell my friend that I know or to just keep silent!
Dear Hector.
If people say, you said that you have told this woman and there is no strong evidence, it is better for you to keep quiet and you will say that this is not true, you will get hurt with the feelings of other people and your friendship might be destroyed.
Even if the things that you have said is true, many are possible to happen within ten years and the woman might have changed.
Talk to your friend, who, of your friend, show her your concern even if you say that the marriage is not a joke, a lot of married couple does not last for it.
What you want is good and happiness.
Ask him with no movement that he is experiencing now that he does not need to answer you even if you just want him to be able to think.
Does he really know the personality and character of this woman?
Give him a principle so that the beauty of character is more important than the physical ailments.
You should leave him with an insult towards him: "To be attractive so the woman who has fear in the Lord should not be ignored." (Kawasan 31: 30).
A woman who has fear in God is going to be honest, not destructive to others, knows how to control yourself, and you can count on all things.
