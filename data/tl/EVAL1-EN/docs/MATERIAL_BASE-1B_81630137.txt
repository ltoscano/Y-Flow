Using the "Smart bomb" of the US, the massacre might happen.

The massacre could possibly happen in the Philippines like what is happening in Afghanistan and Pakistan in front of the use of the AFP of the United Nations which is being used by the military by the military in Parang, Sulu at dawn of February 2.

The AFP dismissed the alleged terrorist Zulkifli Bin Hir alias Marwan from Malaysia, but a few weeks after, the information that Marwan was seen in another country was revealed in another country.

The AFP is proud that last November 2010, the US was given the Philippines by the Smart of the AFP for the operation and that will be held on May 2011 after June, the US was given the Smart of the bombing last February 2 as the first time that the US was released by the US during February 2.

In the experience in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the use of the Smart bomb and drone that resulted to the widespread damage to civilians who are convicted by civilians, including 60 children, were massacred by the Smart bomb that hit the airplane of the US.

It is a big insult that Aquino is trying to make out that it is not violating the US's drone that is not being used by the US's drone where it is said that it is just being used by the US of the drone that resulted in the controversies of the Philippines, including the names of the woman germs in different parts of the country.
