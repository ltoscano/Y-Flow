Pork in politics.

P1M Bira are the only ones who are the only ones.
Is it already money from the Commission on Elections?
This is the question of our UZ" after some of the Comelec denied the payment for the candidates for the amount of P1 million as an insurance for the candidate.
It is said that this will be sure if the candidate will file a candidate who will file their certificate of candidacies.
You will know politics.
We almost fell from our chair, Bro, of ideas.
First, who are the ones who has the ability to run as a candidate?
That is all the rich people who will pretend to run for a rich.
Second, it is natural that no one will run as a candidate even if this is what the people wants to serve them.
What will happen to our politics?
We know that the rich does not have an interest to serve the majority of the poor and they prioritize their personal interests.
For sure, the public service there will be completed.
Really pitiful.
In case the COMELEC will review the cost of P1M for candidates, it is acceptable to take it back after the election?
Or made a non-control.
If there will be no permit, the politicians will be drooling.
Do you make sure, Bro, candidates who are councilor and mayor of small towns?
It is certain that the COMELEC can't give any candidate for that.
What will happen is there are many towns of lack of candidates.
There will be a leader of many municipalities and what will happen to these countries?
SEP-ESETC.
The message here is simple, Bro.
P1M for candidates is nonsense.
COMELEC will leave the people when they want their public service to their country, they have to end off all over politics.
We are pitiful!
