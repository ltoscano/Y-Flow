According to witnesses, I hope.
Jimmy and Jimmy Cantos or June 28, 2016), it is very happy that Tab Baldwin 'game has been very happy for the game held by Calvin Abueva who came back at the FIBA Asia in Changlement, China where the Chinese defeated the gold medal.
I could no longer remember the time Nora said, but I will not forget that he is impressed by the good behavior shown by Abueva of practice.
The only thing that will be, even the coach is happy when he is in his team, Abueva.

It is not afraid of the fight, there is a heart, someone came from, not afraid of the collision, however, we were talking about Abueva who is ready to play everyday, including Alaska, and his fellow veteran, La Tenorio of Ginebra, is not included.

Both of them are both sides.
Tenorio was not played in Changlement that he gave way to other players in order to heal the wound.
The new players in Gilas Philippines are Ryan Reyes, Bobby Moros and Troy Rosario, Parks and Rosario who chose Abueva and Tenorio.
I have no complaints from Koponang Tindan, who has the strategy of his place because of course he will ask why he was not able to ask why he was not able to ask why he was not able to ask why he was not able to ask why he was not able to ask for the team, Abueva and Tenorio.
I remember what happened before.
Baldwin is convinced that the team he built will be given a good fight against France and the New Zealand who is an enemy of Gilas Pilipinas or New Zealand which will be held on July 5-10.
I am also one of those who are hoping that we would reach the cemented finals or will witness basketball, so that we can get the same position in Rio de Jannatul.

But even if you are angry at me, I believe that all these are all over, I am still hoping that, we are still hoping that, we will be fooled and there is a good game for the enemies to be given a good game.
