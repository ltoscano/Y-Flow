Give importance.

Give importance.

(Mt. 28, 8-15)

Give birth to the state of money or to be able to step down to a core-to.

In Tagalog: What happens!

Since time passes, there is also a way to cover up an truth that the guards have given money to cover-up a lie to cover the truth in order to hide the truth in order to cover their mistakes in running forward and murder of Jesus.

But because this is the truth, he could not hide it, and he could not hide, that is why until now the story of Jesus will continue again.

Since the campaigns for local election will surely rise again, there will surely be a lot of money who will receive money to cover the eyes and not see the truth.

Do not get carried away by money.
