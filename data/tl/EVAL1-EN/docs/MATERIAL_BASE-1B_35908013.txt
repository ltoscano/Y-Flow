A bit sore, squid oy, this words of Mayor Duterte, but if examined, there is truth to Secretary de Lima that it will bring along to the NBI and want to be given to all the issues here in this world, but he / she was not able to come upon.
The latest of which of the etiquette of De Lima is here with the problem of actress Vhong Navarro.
"It is one of the saints, Madam Auring, case of physical injury and failure," that is the root of him flirting again and moved by Vhong Navarro, however, the case that he will give in?

You should focus on the resources of the NBI on the revival of what you are saying then who will arrest Delfin Lee, to the siblings Mayor and Gov. Reyes of Palawan, to former General Jovito Palparan and former Representative Jovito Palparan and former Representative Edcel Lagman.
