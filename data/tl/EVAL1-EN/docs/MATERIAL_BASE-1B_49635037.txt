Ruffa and tourism, the fight of Jordan By Jun Lalin July 18, 2016.
There are a lot who thought that if there was a CCTV camera who is focused on them for the TV Patrol that they are taking over the TV Patrol of their mother Anabelle Rama and Ruffa Gutierrez.
May they be able to go with him in a dialogue recently, "although there was no camera, Ruffa (Gutierrez) is always talking to me," he is always listening to me, "he still likes to defend the man (Jordan Mabog) in him!"
Castelo is admits that until now, Ruffa still has not accepted the relationship of the son of Jordan, which is why he is not accepting the relationship of the son of Jordan.
Anyway, because their mother and son did not have an end, many of their scenes are going to be watched over by the TV season when they will start seeing in E! International Channel last July 25, 8: 30 pesos.
"I was able to deliver immediately because there was a camera or nothing else, what they can watch on the TV series we can watch over," that is really what is happening between us. "That is really what is happening to us."
"," others, I thought that we were the script and just acting on me when I am angry or crying.
"Well, how will I act, that's why I am not famous as an actress in the past because I do not know how to look well, hahaha!" Said Naing.
