Amazing!

During the time of war, the story of the old people is often heard from the words. "
It is said that this is coming from the word of English which was made known as a "call of call or Japanese on if there is an enemy or Japanese so that the people will come out and hide for their safety.
The story of the grandfather and grandmother who was worried about the situation in the war was said to have "evacuation centers.
Maybe an improvised gun and only made up by the people.
It is really important that there are evacuation centers in the time of chaos or calamity.
In our time now, what is often experienced is the lack of shelter of people who are severely affected by the calamity.
The victims of flood or fire are often on the schools and churches which can be stopped so if the effect of calamity is affected, classes and mass are affected because of the evacuation centers.
Why is admirable and should be sent to support the legislative chamber that was filed by Councilor Julugan-Illegal Drugs-Rae Tapalla, 5th District of Quezon City.
The proposal of Councilor Medveded is set to build evacuation centers for residents who are living with those who are often passed by and destroyed by natural resources, "the called Disaster Coordinating Council.
The recommendation of the councilor is clear, even the so-sensitive issue that is usually the source of complaints and trouble such as well as the boys and women or women, for those who are weak, old and with disabilities are given attention by Councilor Medveded.
Many will respond to the said resolution, I know many will support this.
It seems that even me is proud of Councilor Medveded.
I was with her father for a long time in the city council of QC and I can see now that her daughter is in good thoughts.
The action should not be delayed in pushing the said resolution.
There are times that calamity happens, this is needed now.
