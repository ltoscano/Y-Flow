Negligence MMDA!

MMDA traffic enforcer Jerry Mallari of Macapagal Boulevard held the SUV of Gng. Angelina Batanglement last day because his driver went to the scheduled 60 kilometers per hour.
What is painful is that he is accompanied by threat that two thousands have succeeded in the seminar, which is why it's as if he has not issued a ticket to just give him a thousand and for free.
Because of this, Mrs. Batanglement said that if it can be P200 in, but Mallari stressed that the victim borrowed money from the P500.
Chairman Tolentino, it's too late for an animal that Mallari gets their pet dog!
Until you make sure that this demon can be touched by his companions and you cannot blame the people if the traffic enforcers would not be respected!
And how will they follow the kind of cruelty to Mallari and does not even feel ashamed of the sake of his family, the money that he took away from his family.
Mallari, if you will arrest, make sure that because it violated the law, the reason why you need to be responsible, is not those who get tired because they are hungry because you are hungry!
