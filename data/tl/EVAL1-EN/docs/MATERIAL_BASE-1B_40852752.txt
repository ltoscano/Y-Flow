I am afraid of PNoy.

It is being used by Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte to Justice Secretary Leila de Lima and to the administration of PNoy that if Duterte will be united, it seems that he does not have any idea about the law.
What's more funny is when the members of the council of Davao City are going to make a resolution to tell de Lima that it is just like that the classes of laws passed on to our local government?
What's more funny is that, it seems that de Lima is willing to do this even if he thought that he is the most sensible and most clean official in our country, he thought, that all people can scare and burn the head but the truth is, he can cheat on it.
Is it not timely to stand a stand for our government against the actions that Duterte is doing, and because the issue which caused the conflict against Duterte and De Lima is not timely so that it is time to take a glimpse of our government on the very high position on the Chinese hand and drugs in Port of Davao?
Maybe it is time for the government to act through the DOJ of De Lima to take the investigation of the murder of my friend Ferdinand "Batman" Linmei.
I am not impressed because I am not afraid of Duterte because he is just brave because of his prominent people who are all people with people.
In the start of the time that Duterte is leading in Davao City, which is the biggest city in the entire Philippines, there is still no progress in this country, it is impossible that there are many cities in the whole country, it is better that there will be more progressive in the jurisdiction of it and a very big chunk of it for big businesses.
And now, Duterte wants to become president of the Philippines!
You hope.
For a very long time, this is the baby's baby in spite of his front of course, I am now thinking that maybe even PNoy's administration is afraid of him.
