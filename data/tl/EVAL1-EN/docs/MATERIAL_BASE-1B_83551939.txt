Let him go out of OT-Ramil Cruz July 25, 2016.
Ginebra got after the First Division, Ginebra, up to the fourth time to steal a bit time, but in the ninth period, they could not take the school range of Alaska.
The Aces came into a 109-100 win against the Gin Kings on the score of PBA Governor's Cup last night on the main game at Smart Araneta Coliseum.
They were left 76-70 after the length of 24-18 in the fourth time, but Regulation and 14-year-old Michael Ichero and 14 at RL-dugo Gang and 14 at RL-budol Gang and 14 points, Calvin Abueva who were 12 points, Calvin Abueva who was held this season in this season.
The newly Import of Ginebra has already ended up on 16 points and 13 rebounds as it is obvious that there is a cringe at Usahay, Sol Mercado of 22, La Tenorio.
The Aces watched the victim at 1-1 card.
"Nice in Seice, the fans of the basketball game on the same game," Aces is calling Alex Comton for post in the interview of "We that's why he / she was born in front of" We.
The 3-bust operation of Henton is starting to start the morale of the Aces in OT, followed by each other by JVee Casio and Abueva who started to go away from the team of Comton ton.
Since then the Gin Kings will not fight back.
There was a last chance that Kings will take a last chance to take the win of Regulation, but it was derailed by Mercado outside the arc when they encountered the defense of Kevin Racal.
