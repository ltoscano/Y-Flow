The promotion is needed.

Avoid listening to rumors.

There is a young boy who was walking to buy pandesal, when the man riding the mayor of the town turned dark, the reason why he went along with the devil, he heard one of those who are buying pandesal, "while the mayor was already sleeping with his power," said the mayor was already sleeping with his power, "after he was hit by the mayor, which was declared as the mayor of the bread."

"Why is it that big sister, is he also the owner of the bakers?" Asked the child.

"Yes, almost all the businesses here in us are owned by him, and if he does not have a business partner," the woman always talks and he leaves it.

At that morning, while the child was going to school, he lost a wide field of corn, he asked the farmer riding the carabao who was the owner of the farm.

"All of you can see or, is owned by the mayor, and he served all these, because the demon is his business partner," the answer of the farmer.

That afternoon, a good maiden is going to put the hips while walking in the house, "said the child, who was walking in front of the mansion," said that it was true that it was true to me, "said the demon who was walking in front of the mayor," said the devil, "I was extremely listening to what the elderly said."

You are still young and do not imitate them because they are just trying to believe you and be bad for them, "I need the promotion to be very popular to everyone!" The insult of the demon and quickly disappeared.
