What is about?

Like before, there is no traffic last Sunday morning, all people watching television in the fight of Manny Pacquiao and Tim Bradley in Las Vegas in America.
Like before, the joke is not a crime because even the evil people are taking care of them.
Like before, others complain because for those who cannot wait for the result of the fight, even a few are not yet allowed to watch a regular local channels.
And like before, the call that Manny Pacquiao will go out is coming out, which is said to be already old, he is no longer the Pambansang Kamao has been over.
There are comments that are not good to listen, like before, only politics is pushing Manny to earn money.
He said that the congressman of Saranggani will run for a higher position so he needs more money and there are many who oppose Pacquiao because of this.
Even the wife of Pacman, Sarangani Vice Governor, Jinkee Pacquiao, is calling for his wife, in the national TV, that he should have nothing to prove and this is done for the boxing ring of his wife.
Jinkee said that what will happen will be a lot of money if they will go home to the family.
As said by the entanglement, Manny's fight is no longer very proud of this Sunday, but the admirable style of Pacman is still there, which shows the sports in boxing and the king here.
Like before, thousands of Filipinos here and in the whole world gathered to watch the Pambansang Kamao in his fight.
People who do not get tired of obsequiousness and do not believe that Pacman's country is over.
Maybe the Filipino does not want to fight Pacman because of the inspiration given to the entire Filipino people.
Whatever is the reason of the continuing fight of Manny, what many Filipinos know is the joy and hope caused by this to each win.
Thank you, Pacman.
