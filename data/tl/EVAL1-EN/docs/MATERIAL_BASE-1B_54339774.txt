Fight if.

Press Bureau of Abac Cordero (Filipino Star Ngayon), PO 2 44; UPP-May 10, 2015 - 12: 00am.

Our Pambansang Kamao is on the way back on Tuesday from his fight with Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas.
How can we need to meet him?
Manny Pacquiao needs a warm reception.
Pacquiao fought for us.
Even if he has a wound or not, he tried to win, if he does not have anything wrong about it, there is nothing wrong about it.
Are we getting angry with James Yap if he was played with a foot in the feet? "We were even impressed by him, right?

Yes, his right shoulder was hurt in training almost a month before the fight, but he admitted that his condition was also serious.
We just have just returned from the fight and we saw the fight with Mayweather again.
We saw his training in Los Angeles and in Las Vegas.
And if he is feeling something, we did not notice it because inside the ring, his punches are nonstop.
Even the left or right.
On the last day of training to the wild card gym were built before he went to Las Vegas, Freddie Roach almost will sell it.
Is that the cause of a bad experience?
I believe that when Pacquiao goes up to the MGM Grand, he only wants to be imprisoned so he asked for a medicine that was not given to him.
In the fourth round, the pain went back so he had a hard time on the fight and did not win.
We see all those pushing for him if that is just different.
It's not Pacquiao.
He turned out to take it, he even punches.
Foolish.
