CHR in Masbate.

Useless, the Commission on Human Rights is stupid, the Commission on Human Rights is useless on the case of maltreatment of the prisoners this Jail IJ-Charge in Masbate Provincial Jail.
What PC Villegas was doing is that the process to be Jobert Rapisora, even if it is inside the prison is clear, it is clear that a type of human rights are clear!
But since we revealed the any various reactions, it seems that the chairwoman's chairwoman in Ann Rosales is like he is still waiting for the said prisoners to die before he will take action!
If CHR will just investigate in Masbate Provincial Jail, they would be proven that they were not only made by the Chief C Villegas was not only done in the trial, Majiha in the various crimes happening here.
Many prisoners are also used to "mining operation" in Aroroy, who are just forced to because of extreme fear!
