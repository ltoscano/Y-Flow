That is just hungry.

Carolyn Bonquin Can.
The poor are approaching, but many are hungry last year.
This is the conclusion of the latest survey of the most popular survey of the Social Weather Stations (SWS) that was held last December 3-7, 2011.
This is confusing, but there can be nothing to happen, "they can do it.
This means, there are Filipinos who, in their own strategy, have slipped off of copper because they will not get rich, they will not get rich.
Perhaps a few thousand pesos is added to their daily budget.
They are lucky that it is unlucky that there are those who have eaten up now who have eaten up now!
Because from the 4.1 million pesos, a 4.5 million families have already experienced a sound in his stomach due to lack of put on it.
I cannot bear to think about some siblings in the sectors of transportation - drivers, small operations, tomatoes, tomatoes, and others are "in the middle of hunger, hoping that I can see them.
If I see them, I will get their names and address because they do not have a cellphone to have a cellphone because they do not have a cellphone to eat.
And if there is a case, but it cannot be used because it cannot be used because, it is likely that they will sell or put it in order to buy noodles and rice for the Pantawid Pasada card.
If I will borrow the Filipino hospital, I will be photographed and their family.
I will put the list of names and address even their picture on the huge fishponds and send to the LTFRB.
Hopefully, if these will be received by the management of the said agency, they convince them to suffer from poverty.
Hopefully, they will wait, please accommodate our request to increase in public vehicles.
Or, so that I will not suffer, they should just use their temple.
