Taguig should be guarded by COA.

The Commission on Audit (COA) should be guarded in monitoring the city of Taguig especially that it was reported that Senator Alan Cayetano has a plan to run for a higher position.
For not yet known, the wife of Alan Cayetano, Lani, is the current mayor of Taguig, where he has a budget this 2013 which is more than P5 billion.
Because of the size of the budget that was mentioned, the Taguig is already among the most big fund in the cities of Metro Manila.
This fund is so big now that is why it is the reason why it can be guarded by the citizens of Taguig to COA because it is possible that it will be used in the coming election case.
In a short word, this can be the main source of the funds of Cayetano when it continues in 2016 especially since the Supreme Court has already declared the Priority Development Assistance Fund.
The loss of PDAF or pork barrel is what the suspicion that the suspicion made is more intense because there is no big business with the Cayetano that they can be allowed to use it and the money they will possibly use in 2016 is not a big business.
These are serious things that should be considered by COA and voters, because all the traditional politicians are fed up.
It can be recalled that there had been a heated argument between the Cayetano and Binay because Taguig was lost in the case regarding the owned by Fort Bonifacio, where a big percentage of the budget is coming from here.
The Tinga camp and allies of this have been questioned for several times to the Council of the Cayetano's harassment against them after their Mawooooooo is being investigated.
As also criticized by the councilors that seem to be the fair treatment of Cayetano in giving help or budget to the councilor, because it is possible that their allies will rise from them.
This is amidst the anger of Mayor Lani against Enrile after being abused by the budget of budget or government funds.
