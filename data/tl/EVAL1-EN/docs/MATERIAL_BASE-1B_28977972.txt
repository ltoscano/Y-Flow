Editorials and LGUs are being alert at the flood, BE, June 6, 2016, PAGASA said, that only a storm will enter the country today, despite good news, it should not be complacent.
PAGASA is saying that this month is going to be rainy and not only rain but strong rain but it seems that only a few hours before the rain fell, it seems that only a few hours before the rain fell, it is then that there will be a few hours before the rain fell.
This is the very big problem because the young students were already able to go to get off the ice-cowardly warning.
It should not be better if it will not be floods in thunderstorms and some of the sudden rains are having a lot of rain in Metro Manila, what if the children are taking advantage of the strong rainfall and suddenly flooded?
Is the local government units (LGUs) are ready to be affected by those who are stranded.
The accident caused by the sudden rain and flooding, especially the children is no joke.
LGUs are very important in any kind of rain brought by rainy season.
Not only for the help of stranded students should be focused on, it is more important to the cancellation of classes if there is really strong rainfall, even if there is no typhoon.
This is the set on the shoulders of LGUs.

There is a need for flood to be monitoring now so that they will not be affected and the cancellation of the classes will not be completed.
