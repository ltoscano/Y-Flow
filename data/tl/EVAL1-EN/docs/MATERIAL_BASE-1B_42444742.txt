"The Marcoses should fulfill their promise that the remains of Marcos will be buried in Ilocos Norte.
This was exposed yesterday by NPA Party of the Philippines (CPP-CPP-NPA) Representative Ma. "Joma" Sison in a video call session in Davao City.
It can be recalled that former President Fidel V. Ramos, cousin of the former president Ferdinand Marcos, was brought home to the Philippines, and he was not able to be buried in Ilocos Norte; however, he was not able to bury the remains of the former dictator at the Libingan ng mga Bayani ().
"The Marcoses, should they fulfill their promise that the remains of Marcos will be buried in Ilocos Norte because I think that is buried," says Sison.
However, Sison also said that he is not really against the burial of Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani because he will not make sure that all buried there are heroes.
"And for the Disaster Risk Reduction, they can be placed in the cemetery of many traitor, everything that is there is not a hero," according to Sison.
President-elect Rodrigo Duterte earlier said that he will immediately allow Marcos to be buried in the Libingan ng mga Bayani in the moment he sat in Malaca√±ang.
