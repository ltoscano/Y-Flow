The Bagong Hunan Bayan and Sorsogon of Ritchie, Ka Angel "Esmilla, Ka Angel" Harilla, the Putatan, who were fighting and offered their lives in the revolutionary service to the citizens.
Ka Angel and Ka King were killed in the lead together with corrupt troops of the 31st Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army in Barangay Carriedo, Gubat, Sorsogon last January 24, Sorsogon last January 24.
Even if they were killed in the fight, Ka Angel and Ka King of Ka Angel and Ka King of archipel31st IB, which is why the 31st IB) is lying down and made out that they were armed with the germs that they fought against the militants who were armed with strong sacrifice.

The courage of Ka Angel, who is already six-year-old who continues to service the Botchok, and Ka King, who is only a few days from the armed forces, offered the highest sacrifice.

Their memory has become the time to serve as inspiration for the Putatan, whoever they have been with and the Filipino farmers in Sorsogon that they served.
