The masses are watching over us, in the living room.

Thank you to Mayor Joseph Estrada and Vice Mayor Isko Moreno and granted the complaint of the devotees of the Immaculate heart of Mary in Binondo, Manila to not continue the transfer of a Marian Rivera in a different place.
The devotees were headed by Brgy. 287 Zone 27 Chairman Pascual Dizon and 1st Councilor Wilson Chua, who gave their whole support here, they insisted that they will not be transferred to the image, thank you very much to you.
It's because the City Development Assistance Fund Office of Manila should have a plan to improve the said plaza in front of Binondo Church, which is why they are going to attend the expenses of beautifying but the condition is to be transferred to Marian Rivera who was built there by Mecrated.
The image of the Holy Week Santos is still a gift to our country when Sister Lucia was still alive on May 13, 1917 to October 13, 1917 every 25th of the month in six months.
Marian Rivera, wherein the image of the image has already been tainted and the same appearance of other Marian Rivera's appearance to the whole world.
Anywhere you go, they have the same appearance.
That's why it's not just the recent grotto of the country, 16, GDi'll stay here in our country in Binondo, Marikina and Novaliches in Metro Manila; Sto. Nino de Molino, Clark, Batanes, Bakag, Baguio, Subic, Clark, etcetera.
