It is not enough.

There are many need to explain that Labor Law Secretary Rosalinda Balentz needs to explain about the decision of the Regional Trial Court (Wage, resiklo of the wage increase of the workers here in Metro Manila.
Instead, they will be recognized for the steps made by the Wage Board which raised P456 in P466 every day at Bishop Wage, the DOLE received criticisms from the workers.
Probably, Baldez and Wage Board Chairman Alex Avila initially thought that the workers will be happy with their decision but the opposite happened.
And there is also a reason for 'Kath' age to his partner because it does not matter and it is not enough that he gave it to.
Almost nothing can be bought at this season for P10 million except for a cellphone load.
The fare is about 8 million pesos in the first three kilometers and even asking for jeepney drivers to raise the fare, so the workers will not even feel the P10 wage increase.
Even if in the sardines, it is not allowed to buy P10 million because the price of youngest delbert will reach P22.
Because of that, it was like an insult to them and they felt that they were a child who was given a piece of snack to stop their noise.
It would be better if the Wage board will not give a increase if it is not enough to give happiness to the workers.
Our councils and his partner have been suffering for a long time because of the consecutive torture caused by the incessant increase of goods due to different reasons.
The best thing I can do is as Balarz, they will consider what is enough, just and right for the workers to be given to the employers, it is better for them to temporarily postpone the giving of marks.
That's why it's very difficult now and he is still having a hard time with my friend, Director Non Fambato, who is the chief of PIO of DOLE for the failure of his boss.
But any explanation of Non is like good luck to our workers because the wage they ask for will not increase.
