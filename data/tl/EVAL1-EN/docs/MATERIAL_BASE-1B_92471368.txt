The foreigners were amazed of the Filipino.

Many foreigners are amazed at the skill and skill of our countrymen, that is the reason why foreign employers want our OFWs to like.
But what is saddening, according to him, he is impressed by the other race compared to his fellow Filipinos.
Just like our Filipinas, where there are many projects, buildings and even bridge was built on different parts of the world, it can be said that they have a direct part of the Filipino engineer who has led and finished these projects.
With their intelligence and skill and entrust to the foreigners to become part of their projects, that is why every Filipino is high, that they should make a huge projects in overseas.
But with the concern of the great Filipinos here in the Philippines, it is suspicious that some of the projects in the belief that he cannot control him are a simple thing compared to the many projects that he has done in abroad.
Aside from his fellow Filipinos always have doubts on his ability, he will just be held by a foreigner (a text message) here in his own town.
That is what our OFWs are extremely saddened if they want to go back to the country, especially the workers who have sufficient knowledge, abilities and skill that are shown in overseas.
They would also like to share the experience received from abroad, aside from the desire to be with the family again and not far from them.
They will continue the foreigners to be impressed by them, than fellow Filipinos who have no idea of being impressed by their ability!
