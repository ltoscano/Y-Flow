Team Pacquiao is happy again in August 9, 2016; Jessie Vargas will fight against Manny Pacquiao, if Bob Arum will be followed - and he is really in November 6 (Phl season).
Thomas and Mabog Center in Las Vegas is lucky that Pacquiao made it in the third round of Erik Morales in the third anniversary of their historical chapter in 2006.
I was there before.
He is also intense as Vargas, age 24, WBO welterweight champion and 27-1, 10 years old, but of course, Pacquiao is still clean, 37, with all all sorts of time; he is 58-6-2, 38 pesos.
Pacquiao will come from the dancee that he is pointing out after the planned win against Timothy Bradley Junior last April 9.
"I still need to work because there is no income from the Senate," Pacquiao said, the elected senator on May 9. "Boxing is my livelihood and I can still be."
And in his return, the entire Team Pacquiao will be happy again because many of them are earning every fight of Pacquiao.
