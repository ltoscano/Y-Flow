Who came from the chaos in BSV-Toda (2).

Let us continue the chaotic and dispute over the management of a association and a tricycle in a place in Quezon City.
Quezon City-Toda-FED and agreed to get in the said chaos and agreed to get the drivers until he was not decided on who really was the president of the said area but was ignored by Francisco Salva, a pastor and continued to collect the daily diet of the drivers.
How many times have been implemented by the two groups, those affected here are the poor members, especially the drivers that jokes in chaos.
Even the office of the Quezon City Police Community Precinct 1, which is headed by Barangay Dist Councilor Raquel Malana, Trawford (TRU), Ret. Gen. Diego and the QC-Toda-FED, could not do anything in the trouble caused by the group of Barangay chairwoman in Curatier and Pastor.
To those who were able to talk to the officials of the QC Hall and the QCPD, even the drivers, they are blaming one of the chaos in the turmoil in the said barangay: This is Barangay chairwoman in Curationist.
Aside from being a chairwoman, who was identified as Jenelyn Acho and his assistant alias Pastor, why did Quezon City government do not do anything here?
When will the local government of Quezon City be action, if they have seen someone who risked their lives?
QC Mayor Herbert Bautista said that if they can't take action, Pchuces, TRU and of the QC-Toda-FED are the conflicts happening in BSV-Toda, in my opinion.
You can resolve it as a leader of the said city.
It is said that you are one, mayor, on the wall of the international law, chairwoman in-cho, so this is just this way if others are hurting his allies.
