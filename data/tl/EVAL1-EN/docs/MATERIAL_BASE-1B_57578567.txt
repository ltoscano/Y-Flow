Food.

Food.

(JO-12:
44-50)

There are two healthy priests who are invited to be invited to the restaurant.
The person going to where they go there is a child and they watch it.
"No matter how much the food they took from the table, they said it was a child:"
Strength.
"They ate!" After a while, a priest stood up and drink.
..., Anito.
He even drank water even though he has eaten a lot of food! "He heard it.
A priest, so he said.
Himself, "I will no longer drink water and something might happen.
Well.
He is a child. "And that is what he can do so that he would not drink water.
They said goodbye.
The child went after him and said there to the priest, "that is his strength to eat, then.
You cannot even drink it! "

The kingdom of God is like a restaurant.
Everybody supports him but each one has freedom to go.
Eat.
Each one is free to eat which is for each other to eat.
Will be accepted.
The invitation and if they are going to get the food.

Deciding to answer the invitation of the kingdom of God.
Accept the cup given to us.
