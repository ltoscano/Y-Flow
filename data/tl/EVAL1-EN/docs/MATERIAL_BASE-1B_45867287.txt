No Fullido.

No Fullido.

(Jugo, 7: 1 to 2,10,25-30)

There are no people who are not afraid of everything, all of us are afraid of those who are afraid of those who are afraid of those who are guilty such as Sabina, rat, a teacher, to a teacher, to a teacher, a teacher, in a teacher, the priest, in a teacher, the priest.

There are many children who are afraid of the priest, why is it based on the parents to use the priest, if the child is stubborn, "if the child is stubborn, it would be said to be chosen by the priest," when the priest came out of it. "

And when we are afraid, we can come from whatever we are afraid of.

But there are all of us who are afraid that we are afraid to die if we are afraid to die, why we are hungry, we are hungry and when we are hungry, we feel thirsty, watching us.

When there is danger, let us go away.

They said that they are afraid of death because before that, the pain and pain that has no showcase are felt, we are afraid to die because we do not know what is there after death.

That is why, what we are feared is not the death but the truth that we do not know the future after life.

Jesus is also having a fear of death?

In the good news trends by Jesus, he is already exposed to the people, he is already in the eye of the law, but it turns out that he is still showing the existing system and he knows that he is challenging his death.

Jesus: "I opened the truth that you didn't know him anymore, because I came from him, because even in front of death, her deep relationship with his mother was what he used to touch.

Even if he died, the deep relationship is deep that is why there is another life again.
