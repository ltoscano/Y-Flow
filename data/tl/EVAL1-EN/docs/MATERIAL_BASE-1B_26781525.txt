Mirror.

Mirror (Jony. 14-7) when you face a big mirror, you will see the image of your loved one and the Holy Week, you will be able to understand that it is you and the Holy Week, she will be able to understand that it is you and the Holy Week, she will do it so that you will make it to the name of Jesus.

If we are prayers, Jesus will be the one between us, Jesus also, and we are thinking about the return of our relationship with God when they destroy it and our heart will start, and we will start to our heart when we need to go back to the Day.
