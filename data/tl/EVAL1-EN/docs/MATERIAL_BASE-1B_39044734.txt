PNoy, let us talk.

With the number of problems being faced by his administration, why did he say that President Benigno Aquino III said that, so he said that the government can't do anything for the calamity that would like to make the country and even the increase in price of goods and services.
Well, what kind of leader President Aquino is, instead of thinking, he was able to put it immediately when it has not even tried a way on how the problem will be solved?
That is the kind of politician who will depend on the popularity of his father Benigno Aquino, Jr. and his brother Kris Aquino, including "Mamondiong, of his mother, former President Corazon Aquino.
If PNoy can't think for the country, what is what he / she will pay attention to the country, what is he / she will pay attention to thousands of pesos, he / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she was able to
Well, it should be for them to have delicadeza that they themselves step down from their position but it is unlikely to happen because they are sure that they are corrupt in the country which is the cause of the continuing suffering in the whole country.
As early as now, PNoy has already thought of other ways to avoid their "boss" from the defamation of media, for sure there will be another anomaly that will appear to bury the issue of calamity, increase in price of goods like oil and LPG and service like electricity and water.
No matter how big the problem is, it is not being given attention by the government and instead he is being removed by other issues, this is the best thing that the Aquino administration will take.
When will the people wake up?
"The problem and giving a problem is not your care, if you do not make it!"
