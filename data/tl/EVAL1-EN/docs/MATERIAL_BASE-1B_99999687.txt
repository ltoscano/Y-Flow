Rainy season.

It is rainy season that is why it is rainy season when the start of school starts?

It is difficult to pass when you enter the school that your belongings are wet.

Your shoe is wet so it's inevitable that you have a umbrella or are raincoats because, it cannot be avoided to read.

It is hard to ride a tricycle or a jeep when it is full, and it is also possible that there will be a long time since the rainy season will start, and if the rainy season comes, there is a challenge that we need to recover, but when the rainy season comes, we will not be eaten when there is a typhoon that happens, but when there is a storm that we have been waiting for, it may not be repeated when there is a typhoon that happens, but when it seems that we have to be eaten during the rainy season.
