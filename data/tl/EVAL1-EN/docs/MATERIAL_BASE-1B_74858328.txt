Malacañang script, rotten!

I do not want to talk about Janet Lim-Napoles.
"I am just disgusted with Malacañang, after the surrender of Napoles," the time that the surrender of the pork barrel scam, according to the report of "Boy Traje," on television, said that Aling Janet had been ready to surrender.
So Lacierda said, he immediately called the famous law of pork barrel, Atty. Lorna Kapunan, he admitted that he was his former boss in a law enforcers, Napoles Law and de Souanilla.
"I almost grew up with the disgust for Lacierda's statement after he was asked by President Benigno Aquino that according to him, it seems that the surrender of one wanted for the President of the Philippines is not only right now, it looks like BS Aquino has accepted the surrender.
Lacierda had a role of paper and read it.
Lacierda said, I am sorry, I am worried that the surrender of the wanted people during the time of President Manuel L. Quezon.
Next to him, he apologized again, Ka Luis Tarzan, who was the leader of Hambbo in the end, after the war was called by Bayan (HMB) and continued the fight against the wrong system of the leaders of the country before.
The chance to convince Ka Luis to surrender is that, President Benigno Aquino Junior, who is the father of Noynoy, was accepted by the President that before was Ramon Magsaysay Boulevard in the agreement, he will be given to a legitimate germs on the World War 2.
Tarzan and Asedillo was the Libingan ng mga Bayani in their time, "that's his face for the surrender of the President, that's why he was transferred to the Libingan ng mga Bayani, which is why he was filed with a serious illegal detention case and kidnapping.
So who will be happy with the script of Malacañang who really prepared to give the reason of PNoy to his surrender to him by Napoles?
