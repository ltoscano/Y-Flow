Biazon, again!

Bureau of Customs (BOC) Commissioner Ruffy Biazon and his staff at Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) showed off.
A woman Indonesian who was allegedly a member of the international drug ring was arrested by the Customs agents with the leadership of Colonel Marlon Almeda and Byron Caratell.
Dwi Walis owner, 31, who was riding an Arab Emirates (EK-332, from Indonesia, China and Peru via Dubai is around 5: 00 in the afternoon on Saturday.
After the personnel of Almeda and Caredt were examined, he became brave, laid down at 8.7 movement of cocaine in worth 50 million pesos.
If we praise Biazon, Almeda and Caredell, it is just right that the personnel of Customs Commissioner Ruffy Biazon, Malvar and team leader Ogie Alcantara will also be held on the shoulder.
According to our mice from the airport, these three were blamed for the death of Walis owner which became the root of the collision of said drugs.
Walis owner is only one of many foreigners who were caught in the ports, particularly in NAIA since he sat as BOC Chief Superintendent Biazon.
It's amusing that this is happening with the current leadership of Adelana because the officials and employees are really working now.
Because they are working, the result is a good upbringing by those who oppose the law.
That's why it's only right for President Noynoy Aquino to maintain Biazon in BOC and hh in order not to run in senate.
Because we believe, Biazon will be the right leader that will bring reforms to Adelana to finally erase the corruption in the agency.
