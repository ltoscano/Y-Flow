Paje and kicked out in the DENR.

If I am Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Ramon Paje and full of controversy in service, I will deport myself in his position so that my life will be at peace.
Why are I going to do this, make it look like it, wherever they go, there are things that would come from me.
Look at it, Tumesoy, what is happening in the life of Paje now, on the Commission on Appointments, how many times has been sold or blocked to be totally complete by the DENR secretary?
Among those who are blocking their way towards him are Senator Serge Osmeña and Koko Pimentel, who both do not want to do not like the corrupt and useless officials of the government to make a mad at the Senate to make it as time to make it up to Paje.
And where the evidence of Osmeña and Pimentel came from, the employees of DENR said that he is not just useless but he is corrupt.
He is puzzled with the appointment of ex-PGMA, Atty. Daniel Macaraeg, and she did not do anything but to close the son of ex-PGMA, who is a child of some corrupt people from the DENR and the Mines and Geosciences Bureau, which is also being complained by DENR.
As of now, ex-DENR Secretary and now Zamboanga del Sur Gov. Antonio Cerge also surfaced to block the CA on CA.
Cerge said, mining in their area in Lupata in their area in Lupata in their area in Lupata.
For the mining to push through, Lupata can be submitted to Lupata in the town of Bayog in the town of Bayog.
"It turns out that this is a boils of it and it could not abort the owner of the company, a Tsinoy businessman from Visayas.
Paje and saying that ex-DENR Secretary Lito Atienza should be blamed for the issue of SOEP.
But, make sure, Paje, who is being done by DENR, now?
Why doesn't he correct this? Or PNoy, will you maintain DENR in his like Paje, who will be swayed by the straight path?
