And remove it anymore.

The stupidity to guide the NFA in solving the lack of supply of rice is the reason why the group of farmers asked the removal of the Department of Agriculture Sec. Proceso Alcala.
This is even if the said group knows that NFA is under the DA and it will not resolve the sudden increase in price of rice during harvest season.
And when there will be a lack of NFA that last month, he is the only solution of Secretary Alcala.
After all, he is deserving to be kicked out because of the said failure.
"That's the only thing, PNoy is looking into something different and gets mad.
But here on the issue of the pork barrel scam, where the DA has one of the agency that was used to rob the funds of the government, tomfoolery in order to maintain Alcala in the DA!
Well, so it turns out that the list of NGO connected to the DA (with Napoles) was not given to the media (with Napoles), because it was caused by Sec. Alcala's "immediate identity."
Why is this in its list "Mister Secretary?
Tangere, remove these inhumane drivers!
