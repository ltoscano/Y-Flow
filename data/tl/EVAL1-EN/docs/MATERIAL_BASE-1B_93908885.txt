PNoy's group wiped the K.

It seems that the boat of President Noynoy Aquino is using an agreement because his speech at the national television series of live is only a big meaning that he has something to explain to the public.
This is the result of the consecutive failures of his followers, particularly the members of Hact-10, Budget Sec. Butch Abad, DSWD Sec. Dinky Soliman, DSWD Sec. Dinky Soliman and the most new to all the boss of Local Government Military Academy (LWA), Rene Villa.
Based on the information of our fervent prayer to the Palace, PNoy cannot refuse this if the group of Abad spoke and submitted his suggestions to him and this has been proven again in the position of Villa, another member of pork barrel queen Janet Lim-Napoles.
It is also clear that PNoy is very clear on the issue of DAP or Development Assistance Fund because it is against the appointed constitution of the country, particularly in Article VI, Section 29 his spending because it is not in Appropriations Act.
In the Constitution, any task to spend or pay the state should be assigned in the House Appropriations Act of the country, and this is clear that Malacanang is clear because there is no DAP in 2011, 2012 and 2013 budget.
It is not a matter if it is spent on the right or not because the Constitution in the Constitution has to be for any expense before it is paid or expenses.
It is said that in a gathering of the street and the court room, the issue of martial law to be one and there is more than the president of the country.
It is clear that PNoy will explain to the people now because he is the leader of the country.
If it is not sure that he will also be like GMA, who after his term is charged with various cases.
That is why PNoy needs to discover a proof because his true staff is already a child of his opponents, who is also a child of position in Malacanang.
