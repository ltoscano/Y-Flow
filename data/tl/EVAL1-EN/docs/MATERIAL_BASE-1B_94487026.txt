One request.

I have read a comment that he said that Michael Martinez will have one comment on his arrival to the Philippines from the Olympics in Russia.
Michael should have reached his position now, and according to his mother, Michael and his family can send their own fame in order to send their own fame in order to support the chosen sports and his family, that is the same way for the youth to rise up in a better future.
What we should wait for is where Michael will reach in the field she is chosen by Michael and she is still too young by Michael and she is still far, he will be forced to give support to him, and if many are ready to give support to him, especially from the government.
In other countries, the support given to the athletes, here in us, is not enough.
The example of Michael is extraordinary because they learned to be alone, just for the support of the small circle of his family.
What will his country do for him, what can we do for him that our flag won in an extraordinary opportunity, Michael pushed himself in order to achieve not being fooled by anyone.
I know, Michael could push for the whole Philippines.
