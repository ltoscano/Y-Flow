Who happened behind the disappearance of rice?

The Department of Agriculture (DA) has ordered the sudden increase in price of rice and there is a need to be held accountable if the ones behind it will be held accountable.
The DA gave their evidences at the office of the National Bureau of Investigation to catch the behind the said illegal increase in price of rice.
What if what is behind the illegal increase of rice is an ally of President Aquino, you are allies of President Aquino, are those KKK or out of-up, will be caught and can be put in jail by the NBI?
You will still hope, it is natural for a new scenario to be a puppy of the President to cover-up if those behind this are in different issues to cover the pork barrel scam.
Maybe the Filipinos do not have the same with them so that what is happening now is just a way for the government to bury the pork barrel issue and Janet Lim-Napoles.
The price increase of rice, gasoline, electricity and the turmoil happening in Zamboanga cannot be denied that it is only a scenario of the government to express the attention of the public and forget the issue of pork barrel scam.
The other day, the militant groups rushed to the warehouse of the National Food Authority (NFA) to call the gate of its gate to release the part of rice in the market or public market to step down its price.
It is also true that NFA is a protector of the rice grains, which is why it has reached P4 billion pesos to P5 per kilo of its price, he was just asking.
If we can remember it, in the SONA of the President last July he made sure that the supply of rice this 2013 will be enough, how it happened after two months, the rice was gone to the market and naturally because there is no rice, its price rises.
Until when will the crisis of rice continue, isn't it really nothing for the Aquino government to do this coming month of December, we can still put rice on the table during Christmas day?
