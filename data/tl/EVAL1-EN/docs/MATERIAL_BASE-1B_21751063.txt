Pasay and Manila, there is a severe damage.

The construction in the ocean in the jurisdiction of Pasay and Manila should be stopped.
It's because its effect in Metro Manila is already different, especially that we all know that this will be the root of the same way the same way to be the same effect of our hardship and progressive community.
A clear example of the severe effect of the construction in the ocean is what happened to the Discipline Office in the jurisdiction of Caloocan, Malabon and Navotas. Since it was buried in the decade of 80, the entire area of Caloocan, Malabon, Navotas and Valenzuela were flooded.
Before, the four cities are not flooded but since the former President Ferdinand Marcos attacked him from the free of former First Lady Imelda Marcos, the suffering of the entire Camanava has started.
The said areas are not just an ordinary problem because aside from the sun, even if the sun is famous, the height of water is different when the typhoon and rainy season comes.
That is also what is happening in the City of Pasay and Manila since a few hundred hectares of ocean located at the Mall of Asia and other buildings built in the hotel and casino.
If we can remember, Pasay City Mayor Antonio Calixto was crying then on the same time that they were able to help them because the flood was different from the previous typhoons.
That is what Calixto thought of what he did for the sale of 300 hectares of sea that was taken by SM because as a city city he should have prioritized the welfare of his jurisdiction over the money that will be brought to the city of Sy.
Hopefully Manila Mayor Erap Estrada can also consider the construction in the part of the Manila area because the entire citizens of Manila will surely be buried.
