There is a GSIS eCard.

It is hard to understand the plan of Police Officer 3 Robert Vergara) government's plan to sell up to 30 billion pesos worth of Prime Minister of said agency before the year ends.
The plan surfaced because Vergara wants to increase and strengthen the financial standing fund.
For me and as well as the millions of GSIS's employees of the government, Vergara should be moderate in his plan and if he continued his plan, he seems that the GSIS's plan is going bankrupt and does not earn a failure, that means he has a failure.
I'm sure that President Noynoy Aquino will not favor it and even the former administration of M Cesar Sarino, the person who is considered responsible, why is one of the most strong GST C.
When Sarino has been seated, a GSIS's situation has been removed but under the great amount of power, he was built on the GSIS headquarters there in Pasay City where the Senate has passed through.
Aside from that, from a few billion pesos worth of assets, the GSIS's ownership of more than P120 billion before he left the position in 1998.
If it is true what Vergara is saying that, around 70 billion which is under the GSIS eCard system, is why they still need to sell drugs?
One of the things that they used to sell is the former caretaker at Taft Avenue, Manila which reached P4470 square meters that reaches up to P450 million pesos.
Aside from that, 821-square meters that is near the US Embassy in Manila are also laid down in the market, and Prime Minister of Commonwealth Avenue in Quezon City and Mandaluyong City.
There are still a lot of Prime Minister of GSIS eCard which is an unknown amount of reason for them to reach 30 billion target.
Their lives are very good because those who were able to sell before them are going to sell and of course they will be the ones who will benefit.
It is only weather weather and it is only unlucky for those who have passed by them because they planted a lot of food!
