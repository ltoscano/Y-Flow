May the Lord Maker is going to witness the newly-elected leader of the country to guide their minds and make a humane, pro-Filipino, pro-Filipinos, and most of all, God and action.
There is a good opportunity for Seno-elect Panfilo Lacson to the promise of the iron fist against President Duterte, it is only now that those involved in illegal drugs, especially those who are involved in illegal drugs, especially those who are involved in illegal drugs, especially those who are involved in illegal drugs, especially those who are involved in illegal drugs, especially those who are involved in illegal drugs, especially those who are involved in illegal drugs.
Including the military's statement that any time the police will need their help in his campaign against criminality, they are ready to give it.
Lacson was impressed by the "tanim er and performer" of chose by Duterte Chief of Duterte, General Ronald "Bato" dela Rosa because he can bring a good result.
In the end, the statement of the senator, who is the former PNP Chief, is clear that the people will be successful with the anti-crime campaign, especially in drug war, the Duterte administration, "said the Aquino administration," the Our Lady OPLAN).
Yes, if illegal drug operations in the country are different, people will directly benefit and, most of all, are the youth.
Hopefully the mind of President-elect Duterte will have a clear mind that he will need his partner, "mother," to his brave government, but he is no other than VP-elect Leni.
It is time to heal the wounds of the campaign and election and temporarily removed from the hurt friends for the sake of the country!

The people, on the other hand, should remain watching the movement and decision of the new orders of new officials.
While the success is hoped for and the mind is open for a fair chance, you should not give up being observant and irregularity, especially for suspicious transactions.
