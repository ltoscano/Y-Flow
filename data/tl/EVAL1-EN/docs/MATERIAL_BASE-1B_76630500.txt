The Commission on Elections (Comelec) has cancelled the first plan of conducting a mall voting.
The retreat from the malls voting is being implemented, according to COMELEC chairman Andres Bautista after getting 4-3 votes in favor of garbage from the initial decision of Hel body.
The voting was held at the gathering of the mall voting in relation to the legality of the plan, the Comelec en banc due to the vote of 6-1 which is in favor of the mall voting last March 10 but has changed a chance to discuss yesterday the mall voting in the vote of 4-3 in favor of the cancellation.
Because of the stunted mall voting, more than 231,174 voters who were first given a chance to vote in the malls.
But for us, it is good that what happened is good and the announcement of the COMELEC in the gathering of the mall in order if this will only be a problem in the upcoming election on May 9.
In our opinion, we believe that all the plans related to the election this coming May could not cause an additional disease in the election this coming May so that the votes of the candidates who will vote for the malls will not cause an issue.
That's why we salute the quick decision making by the COMELEC in this issue so that they will lessen a lot of things in relation to the held national and local elections in the next month.
