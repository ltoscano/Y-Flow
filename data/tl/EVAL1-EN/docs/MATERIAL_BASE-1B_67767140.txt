Editorously, not contented with May 6, 2016.
The Department of Tourism (DOT) announced that there is no effect brought about by the tourism sector of the country with the series of kidnapping of Mindanao which is involved by the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG).
Instead of the tourism spread, the number of tourists who visited the country reached the time when the issue on the left kidnapping of ASG, especially the foreigners.
In the report of the DOT, the number of tourists visited the country last month of March compared to similar record of kidnapping, and according to the DOT, they became successful because of the negative image made by the Abu Sayyaf.
That's why the DOR is now positive that the six million target to be held this year will be positive.
We are also being carried out by the DOT because they prioritize the said crisis which is caused by non-conformers who will be happy with the bandit group.
But we should not be complacent about the government and act on to end the non-let go of the abduction done by the said group.
Our government should not be discontentment with the events because it is not impossible that the tourism will not be affected in case the rebels continue to spread fear because of the failure of the rebels to protect the evil people of ASG.
