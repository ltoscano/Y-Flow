Dear Manny.

Orena Drilon.
The truth is, I do not make your loss too much, that is really the rules in the field of sports - you have lost all sorts of names, those who can suffer, including political power, and because of that, I still remain a fans.
Perhaps, what I did not show to your fight is that, because I was washing a plate before, that's why I didn't see the sound from the television, that's why I didn't see the sound from the television, that's why I did not see each other in the television, he seemed to have a rest after the six-year-old fist fight.
I was not able to know how much you get sick; I also do not have any ambition to punches at the face, and probably because of the long time that you are going to gather, you are always used to see that you are going to see the enemy.
With the huge amount of confidence in your ability, we are blaming other things that your defeat is, and we also say that you have no idea in the rules of boxing because you have no idea on the rules of boxing, that's why you have no idea about the rules of boxing, that's why you lose, "said your office.
As they say, that is also their own belief as well, I do not know what is happening between you by Jesus Christ, you are already old, and that is the rules in the field of sports and there is a loses.
Inside the ring, you and your fist will still answer, whether you're going to answer, it seems that you are moving your ability on the actions of the opponent, as well as your former opponent, it seems that you got away until you dropped down until you dropped down.
But your old age, like your former fight, easily got up.
Again, that is not the last ten seconds of your life until there is still a strength for your arms, until you still have a strong opponent in their faces, we hope that it is just a fight, "that is not the end.
