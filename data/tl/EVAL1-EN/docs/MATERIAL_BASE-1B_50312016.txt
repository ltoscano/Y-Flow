The hole on the Blumentritt market was congested.

When former President Joseph Estrada sat as mayor of Manila, he promised to clean his jurisdiction from corruption and fix the livelihood of the poor people in his jurisdiction.
Naturally, he is with Vice Mayor Francisco "Isko Moreno" who really worked hard to work so that the path in the city will start, this is where the exchange of buses in Manila started.
He finally calmed the streets especially when the selling of the proper place where they will earn is, but unknown to Mayor Estrada, there are some corrupt who are taking advantage of the trust that was given to them.
That's why now, a few areas to increase the flow of traffic due to.
There will be more than one hundred pesos but it is not the guess of many drivers from a jeep to the chief of Blumentritt Police Community Precinct.
The place is very annoyed from the fair amount of money which can be held accountable but it has been tainted by a lot of complaints, but it does not hesitate to have a negative flow of vehicles, but it does not fail because Mayor Estrada is not yet visited by Mayor Estrada in his jurisdiction.
That is why some barangays in the jurisdiction of Blumentritt PCP and fruit game are really widespread because he might choke on a day when the mayor went to Blumentritt and hot-tempered because of extreme traffic and they increase the vendors that will give them up everyday.
