Editorously started by PNoy.
BE is June 9, 2016 when the cabinet of the next President Rodrigo Duterte, one by one, is also one of those who are preparing their plans to do and push for the program and policy.
It is fun that there are also a lot of programs started under the PNoy administration.
One of these is the K to 12 education system that he supports the program and is decided to continue under the administration of former Sec. Mar Roxas with the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), which is based on the record of the national police that is based on the record.
It can be seen in the successive anti-drug operations, especially in the provinces, how the police became active under the leadership of the PNP Chief Director General Ricardo Marquez.
It was also expressed that President-elect Rodrigo Duterte also expressed the movement of the EDCA, an additional defense agreement between the Philippines and America, in the word "this is needed by the Philippines."
Even the Armed Forces of the AFP and PNP, under the PNoy administration, can fly again and even more.
Even the strong economic provisions is to be followed by the Duterte government.
Hopefully, the beautiful "Clark international City" project in Pampanga will continue because it is part of Pilot project which is part of strengthening the economy of the region and provinces so that the businesses and population will not be removed from the cities.
There are a lot of great programs and projects that can be made to make it fully and strengthen the next administration of Duterte.
