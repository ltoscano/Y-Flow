I am carrying Guillena.
Happy greetings to your important and meaningful day!
Thank you very much, to the current officials of the national offices of the College of the Philippines (CEGP), for the invitation to talk to me, as long as you ask me to speak with the faces of my co-Tropas.
It was acknowledged by CEGP, for the last moment, after the sure that they would go back to our fellowmen; it (2) there are much more than me; (2) there are many things that they cannot go to and talk in front of us; we say that we can easily pity and convince him, and ready to support the one we love.
Just a little show, as long as I was identified as Kenneth Roland Guda, I am the editor-in-chief of Filipino Weeker, an NGO connected to the citizens of the country.
I am not a official of Guillena, for sure many of you have an honor that has a duty in your time, including our Barangay magistrates who are in the office and may be too busy so that it will be approved by us.
I have not been an official of CEGP, but he became a member, because it became the writers, and mayor Fuentes in the year 2000, in the year 2000.
That is not that long ago, but during that time, many are happening in the sector, here in Diliman, but when I was able to go out of the Pacific Ocean, it was found out that there was a copy of the CEkyong Fernandez, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, that was why when I was able to go out of the Pacific Ocean, that was when I was able to go
But on the editing training, we tried to discuss and use as a model for the CEGP who took care of it, even when he became a chief of the campus, that was why even if he became in the reading of the campus, that was not able to learn the right way out of newspaper.
Every Brigada Eskwela is known, by every campus that passed by the Congress, convention, which is not a joke, just a few pieces of knowledge in college, it is not a joke, we know how much is the service of CEGP who is in college or in that point, it is enough to celebrate a picture in college or in that point, it is enough to celebrate the continuing legacy of CEGP in speech in the country.
Of course, I still haven't mentioned the more than its huge contribution: The revelation of the principal which is happening, but instead of bringing the Ceagerness, "or in the country, we have no one-giving, not only one-tempered," the truth, "Ikaw Lamang,"
To some of us who was able to finish or get the course of journalism, the Tanim-Tantos, but it is not true that there is no one speaking in the truth, but it is not true that they have no one-in-law, but it is not true that they are protecting their view, and it is not true that they are protecting them, and the truth is, "their service is not true.
If their goal is true, for example, why are all the protests of the workers and employees, which are not being given priority in the national issues, discrimination among women and employees, that is why they do not need to talk about it, because they do not need to talk about it, because they do not need to resolve the price hike of the community, discrimination among women and institutions, that is why they do not need to talk about it.
And what is the content of our newspaper, in our newspapers, in our newspaper or alternative media?
There are already a lot of journalists who passed by, many of the journalists who passed here, many of them were successful in different field of journalism, who were said to be successful in different field of service, Jonas Burgos and James Balao, who were still missing, Jonas Burgos and James Balao, who were still missing, Jonas Burgos and James Balao, who were still alive.
It has been its location and I am proud that it would be a part of Guillena, which I hope for my work as journalists for the progressive or an alternative that I want to continue, all of our history, to continue writing, continue to be on your side.
Thank you very much!
