DepEd is also respect of my religion? (Philippine Muslims here, Dr. Love.

David D, Angelo.
Education - education, opinions.

I was surprised with the news that they were confronted by the Pilipino Star Ngayon last one day, "why did you see the news of a religion that affects one thing in his belief that it is right?

Instead of giving attention to so much lack of bones, the lack of classrooms, the lack of classrooms, it is still not perfect for the muslims inside the school where it is a student but the teachers are prohibited.

That kind of style.

What is about to happen is that, "Dr. Love, is an insane religion of the Muslim brothers and this is in accordance with Allah, if I am wrong with what I admire here, I may have accepted your opinion.

Even if I am not PhD, I know as a couple that is not in the presence of Dr. Love, the solution to the low quality of education is what I see, based also to the teachers of my three children who are studying high school.

1 is the arrival of some people.

2 - the schools are lacking in equipment.

3 - there are also teachers who don't know what to say and sometimes it is wrong.

4 - there are some who are so big "boish, and thinking of a new leader, even if the answer is right, they would say it is wrong.

5 - the student does not have to read so that the solution to the student will pay is the hotness of every etiquette.

6.

Maybe there are still a lot of time to add there and that is the problem, why the quality of education is not enough, not for me to be an expert of my fellow muslims!

Hopefully, even if we are one Christian nation, we should learn to respect and become sensitive to the religion of others anything for their status or state in life.
