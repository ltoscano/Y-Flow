It's too late.

It seems that the candidates of United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) seems to be in the slums (UNA) after 3 of the candidates of the senator entered just like September 12 in the recently concluded survey.
It's because President Noynoy Aquino has a different urge to his candidates because it is clear that the people salute him because of the coming of the "straight path" to walk by the government.
It is also a big thing for the President to go with Team PNoy because his form or to the people is the basis why they will help the adversary.
It is also clear that the candidates of Team PNoy are fearless with corruption like they are Senators Loren Legarda, Chiz Escudero, Allan Cayetano, Antonio Trillanes, former MTRCB boss Grace Poe, "Sonny Angara, former Representative Cynthia Villar and Bam Aquino.
If the performance of the incumbent senator who is in Team PNoy will really be maintained, it is really natural because they work in the Senate, their hearts and brave meddling in the issues of the country will be added.
It is not a burden to the fight of UNA and that is showed to the statement of Representative Toby Tiangco, spokesperson of the group of Erap, Binay and Enrile because it seems that they are saying that their tactic are wrong and they will feel that they will tease them.
In a short word, UNA has been lacking and that is where the team of Team PNoy is benefiting because they know the weakness of the opposition and they also know the weakness of the people of President Noynoy Aquino.
There are still a lot of sure that will happen in the campaign but it is certain that the 3 candidates of Team PNoy will rise up with former Senator Jun Magsaysay, Riza Hontiveros and Jamil Madrigal Street.
