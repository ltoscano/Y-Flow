Pacquiao 2 more fight in BE is August 16, 2016.
Manny Pacquiao needs to defeat Jessie Vargas in November 6 (Phl's time).
Because, as early as now, Bob Arum said that Pacquiao has 2 more fights in 2017.
"After Vargas, Pacquiao can still be for 2 fight," Arum said in English, "Arum said in English which I cannot blame Arum if he is in confidence.
Like the belief of Pacquiao's millions of fans, it is hard to defeat Pacman.
Juan Manuel Marquez is just proud of Pacquiao and the right shoulder of Pacman is really limping when there is Floyd Mayweather Junior in 2015.
Marquez does not want to fight against Pacquiao after he gets angry and with the 6th seat of Pacman because he might be the sweet taste of his win last 2012.
But Mayweather is always ready, Arum himself said: "One of the 2 fights of Pacquiao in 2017 is Mayweather."
The all-time record that Mayweather cannot be ignored is that it will be him if he defeated Pacquiao.
For Pacman, the biggest amount of revenge is that he will be the first to have sex with Mayweather (49-0).
That's why even Pacquiao and 39 have 39 years old, they are not yet done.
Also add there are the tons of dollars who are going to go and will go to their time even during the time that they will push through it.
In boxing, it is really nothing to think.
