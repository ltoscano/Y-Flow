Means of DENR in Bicol and sugar in Bulacan.

It's been more than a thousand of beans everyday from Saturday when DENR let it pass to Manila.
It means, a lot of trees are cut off everyday so they could have a number of coal.
Which is why it is in danger, which for a few years that will come, the forest in the Bicol Region in the position of the crocodile in the DENR in Bicol is expected.
Said ordinances are coming from Tinambac, Camarines Norte, in the jurisdiction of the office of DENR in Goa.
When Pio Catapang is still the CENRO in Goa, it started to give permission from "three Marias" passengers of coal at Manila.
This way was discovered by Regional Director that is why Bernal reached Naga City because it was not the DENR Office that resulted in Tinambac,
What is baffling is, Celecoxib is still continuing to give a permit that is coming from Tinambac!
It is clear that Bernal fooled the DENR Regional Director but also President Aquino, who recently expressed his opposition to illegal drugs in any part of the country!
A text message is that we will smell the accomplices of Bernal, and how much is the transaction of the inhumane people!
