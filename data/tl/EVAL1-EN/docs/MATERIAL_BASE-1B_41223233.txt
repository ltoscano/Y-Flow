He / she has a heart of a heart.

Father who has a heart of mother (Jony. 16-28) do you have a pet chicken for you, it is nice to watch his chicken, it is nice to look at her legs and she is calling her children to be safe, and this is his way to make them happy.

The bad animals are changing when they are having a child for example, if before, he is nice and become aggressive in order to protect their children, "the Lord knows that we need to protect her children," God knows our needs and he is giving all your needs and this is what he gives.

What we only need to do is pray and asked in the name of Jesus. The truth is that God knows what we need but we still need to pray because this is the way to accept the blessing given by God.

Like the chore that they are calling for their mother when we are near and when there is an impending danger, we should also thank God, we hope that we are the heart of our mother, the Lord, who is the family of our mother, is also a heart of our mother.
