Consult the BOC and VP.

This is really a different kind of chief of the Bureau of Customs Commissioner Ruffy Biazon as it was recorded in the record of the country on the biggest end of drugs last 2012.
The number of the end of BOC is bigger than the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency because Napoles's personnel became persevering in monitoring the airports and ports of the country.
Drug addict who goes to the Philippines are not preparing to raise drugs because their modus operandi is already known, which is why the international drug syndicates do not know.
When Biazon sat as seated in AOIana, he ordered the double security guard in the contraband that was launched by corrupt businessmen.
He tightened the monitoring of those who were selling drugs.
The record for the leadership of Biazon to BOC on the campaign of drugs last 2012 was cruel because they were reported to be the biggest caught in drugs.
Up to more than 53 kilos of methamphetamine, 8 kilos of cocaine, 33 kilos of marijuana and other types of drugs were tried to be smuggled in airport.
Up to P465 million worth of drugs were confiscated by the personnel of BOC on where the style of the syndicate was confiscated, causing the arrest of 17 drug addict who are all foreigners.
Not only admiration should be given to Biazon as government and even the citizens but we should focus on his goal to sweep the corrupt government officials.
That is why President Noynoy Aquino's trust to him is stronger because he knows that the goal and program of Biazon will be like his desire to raise the "straight path."
