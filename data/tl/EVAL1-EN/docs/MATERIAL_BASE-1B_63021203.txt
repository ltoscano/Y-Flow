Government does not have a system.

Until now, our countrymen are still in danger because of the lack of system of the national government in giving care, help and help to the victims of typhoon Yolanda who killed thousands of lives.
What we heard from the complaint is not a joke and complaint of our countrymen who are victims of the said calamity, even if it is in radio, television and on social communications, it is very clear that nothing has arrived from the government.
Almost a week has passed since Yolanda visited the country but our countrymen in the Visayas and Palawan still remain surprised, that is why many people get irritated with the lack of government system.
For them, the government of Aquino is just doing well with the media through a place but in the actual help, it is really lacking.
At present, the dead are still scattered in Leyte, Samar, Tacloban and Coron in Palawan which is really being broken or failed because of lack of help and lack of system.
It could not be found in the time of calamity that is why we have the office of the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (NDRRMC) to plan and become a branch in the time of calamity, but it appears that it became a branch of the government that gave news and information to the people.
To a short word, plan and strategy should be considered in the current time and this is where PNoy should be called for by the men because the situation will possibly worsen.
It cannot be avoided that the people have a mind that there is politics in the calamity because it is clear in the report that there is also different action center or based in Tacloban City government and the National government in the area, which is very important because the action was cut off as well as if there is a spare tire of the service.
What happened to our country is a calamity that is why we should show our unity and not disunity, system the solution to the problem and that is what the government should focus on.
