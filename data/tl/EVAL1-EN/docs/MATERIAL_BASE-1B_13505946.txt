PNoy does not want to greet you, Ka SH.

PNoy promised that the pork barrel of the pork barrel, but he is too much.
The truth is he just wanted to change the name of pork but the system is still there.
The congressmen and the senators are still in charge of pork barrel.
Last Tuesday, PNoy's promise made a bigger promise.
He told the Supreme Court not to declare the pork barrel.
PNoy and his congressman through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) asked the Supreme Court to not remove the amount of pork barrel because the country is pitiful.
I cannot understand PNoy.
In my opinion, he felt pity for the congressman and senators who will lose pork and not the country that his boss is saying.
His true boss is the thieves who are politicians and not the town, carrying a lot of 10 billion pesos.
The position of PNoy continues to ashes about the issue of pork barrel.
If there is no pork, the children of PNoy said, how about the accomplices and those who have no money?
This fear of politicians is not the basis.
The government has a fund for education but instead of giving the money to the Department of Education (DepEd) and to Commission on Higher Education (Commission on Elections), these politicians go.
The government has a fund for the Department of Health (DOH) in order to treat the diseases that are sick, but it was entrusted to the politicians.
The case to continue the pork barrel is filed by the Supreme Court of OSG that will be filed by Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa, Budget Secretary Florencio Abad, House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte.
Isn't it that they themselves are involved in this scam, which is said to be involved by Janet Napoles?
