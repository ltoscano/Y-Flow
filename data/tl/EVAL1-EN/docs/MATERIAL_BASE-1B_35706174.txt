The problem of Evite.

The problem of Evite (Mt. 13-24) one of the biggest issues that needed to face the evil, why are we going to know that this meaning is the lack of beauty, and if we will give it to the evil, this is the lack of beauty that should be found.

For example, poverty is the lack of wealth that should be there; the illness is the loss or lack of good health; the death is the lack of life, but why the Lord is perfect and pure goodness, why is it experiencing the lack of lack of goodness?

This is answered by good news trends by this is like a farm which is being planted with a prosperous life but there are grasses.

Let us just let it go together but in the time of being planted there is a good reason to live here so that there will be a good plan from evil, that is why there is a good plan coming from the evil.
