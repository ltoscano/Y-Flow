Secretary Petilla, shameless and PDAF by Jinggoy Estrada.

Every time I remember the pride of energy Secretary Jericho Petilla, it is as if I am being guarded!
It's because the animals are proud when he promised to resign from his duty if he will not be able to restore the 100 percent electricity in the places destructed by Yolanda.
What is painful, is that he is from Leyte himself, Petilla himself, who when made a promise, is in front of his coats!
Poor people from Leyte.
Yolanda, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk!
Do you know, Secretary Petilla, I am the one shy for you?
I hope, if I can't do something, I should not make a promise, I hope that if I will love me, I will fulfill it!
"I hope," what you did to Secretary Petilla, is that you will prove to those who have heard what you have heard in your promise that you are a real man!
To be honest, that you damage the sun! "Do not allow you to reveal the television that you becomes tangled because I am fed up to your face!

Here is an issue on the lower part of the face after being questioned by the plunder case in the position of Napoles with violation of millions of money from the Priority Development Assistance Fund or PDAF, the names of Senator Jinggoy Estrada.
That's why we cannot blame Senator Antonio Trillanes when he said what Jinggoy did was really a taste of his face!
In the right thinking, we are not talking about it if the city of Manila is anxious over or not.
The point here is that Jinggoy has not yet carried out that there is no truth in the case he is facing of corruption, he will again beat him again!
What is painful, the 100 million peso money from his PDAF was given to the city where his father is the mayor!
And this happened, its distribution, just a few weeks have passed since the Supreme Court declared illegal PDAF.
They say that names are just different, which from PDAF, was made into the Assistance and Local Government units or ALGUs.
King mother!
