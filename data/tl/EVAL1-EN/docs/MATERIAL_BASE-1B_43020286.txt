"The" epal "is coming out from the hole.

Just a few more days and the filling their candidacy for the local election will start, but as early as now, the "epal" "will start from them."
Perhaps in every place here in Metro Manila, you can see that you are working in a "epal" '"epal" which is hung on a post or on the houses beside the road, "others are on the tricycle.
I am puzzled with the "epal" "why now they are just coming out when almost Metro Manila can't be seen and helped by the victims of the flood.
"When the flood has subsided, the" epal "" said that one by one, the "epal" "" said that those who have the most "epal" in Metro Manila, the Quezon City might be released from social media, CAMANAVA), Las Pi単as, Pasay City, Para単aque City, Para単aque City, Para単aque and Muntinlupa City.
Anyway, what should we do with that, they will take care of that only to wake up the voters that until now they are still sleeping.
Hopefully the councilor will pass a law for the ban on put or responsibilities in the roads because it is one of the source of the accident.
"It's not only" "epal" "what is coming out from their dens but their leaders who have not yet visited their candidacies," hopefully, they should not vote "" "" "" because the "" epal "will just start to vote," because they do not have a form of form. "
