Duterte is ready to push through the formal peace talks, based on the initial peace talks, based on the earlier signed agreement they should face the root of the armed forces that will vote for a fair and long-lasting peace.

The peace talks by the GSU-NDFP will only be included in the basis of the widespread agreement from 1992, even if the "Special Action Force has a lack of caution for anyone who are on the side of GEGARAOCITY, it is possible that the alternative ways of negotiating with NDFP members will be released through neglect or violation of this agreement.
