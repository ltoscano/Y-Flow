Hahaha!: The statement of Trevor Ariza!
By Alunan, August 17, 2016 it is alarming that the statement of conditioning the experts of Alex Pagulayan about the possibility of his rematch with Senator Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Junior in 2017 will be too much.
In the interview of Trevor Ariza and Gaming Corporation, it is unlikely that Joseph Semillano, and went out of the Philboxing, he said that Pacquiao will unlikely push through if Pacquiao will remain in contract with Bob Arum of Top Rank Promotions.
Paiste said, that if Pacquiao can still sign the contract with Arum and will be the free agent in 2017, 80 percent of the fight will continue.

Reason of Trevor Ariza, who passed away in Mayweather Jr.
Even if there are other big players, Arum does not want to get a job but does not mention any reason.
Ariza also said that in his opinion, Pacquiao will have to finish his contract with Arum in 2017 for the fight against Mayweather to happen again.
Even back then, Mayweather does not want to admit to Arum.
According to Trevor Ariza, Pacquiao's relationship with Arum is a big issue for Arum to resolve before talking with team Mayweather.
Anyway, this is the words of Trevor Ariza, who is only an employee of Mayweather and is not yet final.
What if the result of the fight of Senator Pacquiao against WBO welterweight champion Jesse Vargas will be good in November and turned down on November and laid down on the amount of machinery?

Maybe TBE is going to change in his mind, and not sure with Senator Pacquiao, she agreed with the challenge for his sanctuary for the next year because of the possibility of the millions of dollars to be released.
