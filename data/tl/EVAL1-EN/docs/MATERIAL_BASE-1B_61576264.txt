NPA averted by Risa H.,

Among the number of men running in the Senate, a woman tried to fight the abuse of the New People's Army (NPA) this election.
Instead of being afraid, the Team PNoy's complaint about the complaint of the Department of Justice (DOJ) is being used by the NPA to the candidates.
Particularly, Hontiveros did not complain about the checkpoints and the campaign of NPA in all of the candidates who will enter the red area or protect the place of the rebel group.
So, why is it that candidates for Hontiveros did not wait for the fight that the NPA will catch up?
Is it possible that they will also give money that is why other tourists are free to go to places where the NPA owners is widespread?
What he said was right, he said, former Congressman Hontiveros, a kind of abuse being done by the NPA and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) should act to stop the delusion of the rebels.
On the other hand, it took a report that Hontiveros did it.
He does not care if the legal members of the NPA will campaign against his candidacy.
What Hontiveros did, what the NPA is doing is wrong and should condemn it.
With what Hontiveros did, this will only get sympathy and vote of the people especially in the countryside where the spread of terror in the NPA continues.
Laos will be held up by the NPA and this is not effective for the filipino masses.
With what Hontiveros did in the NPA, this is a type of miracle that the candidates will not do anything and his ambition to become a member of the Senate.
Your decision is with the people!
