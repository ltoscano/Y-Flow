Useless on the LTFRB and VK-PAUE in Malabon.

That is why accidents happening in the provinces which are involved in the provinces involving the provincial buses are widespread because the management of LTFRB is the number one useless!
Aside from the accidents, being covetousness of the provincial buses are the primary problems of the provincial buses.
Most of those who experience bad deeds, abusive drivers or stalling and are just being fooled by the resentment because they do not know how to collect their complaints.
What is painful, a few who dared to complain in the LTFRB but was not given action to the office of Chairman Winston Ginez himself.
This August 10 was sent to the LTFRB by the 77-year-old Fidel Banzon in his complaint about the number of times that he / she was about to give him an additional actor of Bus N0. 8518 of the Velvet Revolution who has office in Gatmaitan's Street, Leyte.
The incident is often being done by the said target actor every time the Banzon from Kao. 24, Poblacion, La Loma, Leyte going to Kailbo, Ormoc City.
Starting from August until now, the pity of Barabas is still sleeping on the noodle house that LTFRB chairman Winston Ginez himself is still sleeping.
Are you really mad at your office Chairman Ginez himself because he is super strong with PNoy?
Ginez was blamed, his former "prosecutor," of the removal of Corona, which is why it is believed that PNoy is a gift to him by PNoy.
King-mother! It should be said, it is better to love your job as gratitude for the gift given to you!
Now, you should prove the followers of PNoy that you are not negligent, corrupt and useless just like what you are going through with the former administration.
What is coming out is that, you are still severe! You act, Chairman Ginez himself, until we still have respect for you!
