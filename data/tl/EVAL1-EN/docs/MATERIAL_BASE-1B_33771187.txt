Being a Christian and the increase of children, LJ Reyes, knows why he does not want to be sexy in his next movie since he does not want to win as the Gawad Urian supporting indie movie Anino to Likod Center on the month, where he / she has a mistress.
Even if it's said that even if the doctor asked him to pay for him for a point, he does not want to fight back anymore but, if he can just go with it, he might think twice.
Well, it's the decision of LJ says that there is no problem because she has proven that she is a good actress that is why she will see Nora Aunor, Vilma Santos, Jaclyn Jose and others.
It is nice that it was said that the incident was given an award at night but he did not know that she won't be the one who won if his ex Paolo Contingent is not yet told.
He was really shocked while walking up at Amao Road in order to accept the award because she was not able to talk about it because it was also given to us who testified.
She said he felt sorry that he could not give birth to someone who wants her to be with him, "that was the only future, which is why he was not able to take it.
Meanwhile, LJ, for the First Family, told her that her idol John Lloyd Cruz, who she would make it in person, she feels.
He said that he would be with it in a project that is not impossible because of indie films, those who are impossible are possible.

So, let us just wait for it, duh!
