The political life of Binay and Roxas presented by Yolanda.

In the tragedy that happened in Leyte and Samar, we saw how the system of our government is on the help of thousands of victims of the super mayor of Yolanda.
We also saw people who do not do anything but to face the camera in the camera and search for people who should be blamed for the death of thousands of people.
It has been years since the onslaught of Yolanda in Leyte, Samar, Iloilo, Capiz and Palawan but only a few who benefited from the said relief goods from the government, even the relief goods coming from other countries.
Until now the Top Rank administrator was still waiting for the order of what they will do to those affected by Yolanda, even the three cabinet members who are said to be the shadow of the President where it is also one of these to Interior and Local Government Secretary Mar Roxas.
The victims who were able to talk to today from Tacloban and Ormoc as well as the suffering and action of the government, especially in order to give relief goods, it is even worse than the profit brought about by typhoon Yolanda.
With the burden done by the government to those who are part of Yolanda, the bet of the administration will still get the votes this coming 2016 presidential election?
Where will DILG Secretary Mar Roxas and Vice President Jejomar Binay be picked up, that everyone knows that his ambition to become the president of the country will be removed.
What would be the outcome of the political life of these two?
It would be better if they will be drowned in the onslaught of Yolanda in Visayas region?
Will these two get up to their failure that they are the ones doing it?
Well, to wait for the See.
"That is if our countrymen will wake up to a long move or they will still send money to the money and will be cooked by the administration.
