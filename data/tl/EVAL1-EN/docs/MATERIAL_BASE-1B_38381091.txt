New Year's mission, Goodbye Philippines.

When they look at the street children who continue begging on the streets, it's going up to passenger jeepney even if Christmas is over, we are weak and losing hope that the country Philippines will rise from poverty.
Because the officials of the government, especially those who will be elected in position in the past elections, that we will not depend on their promise, but they have not forgotten about their promise, but they did not forget all of those who are involved in corruption and did not understand if all their own pocket is not being observed.
This 2014, it is certain that they will become a lot of friends if they will change their ugly behavior or those who are with the administration of President Benigno Aquino III?
Hopefully, President Noynoy himself made a promise that he himself will clean his yard from corruption.
This year, the Aquino government will fire and file a case against the government officials who are involved in corruption even if they are among relatives, friends, classmates and Kabarilan of President Aquino.
PNoy will also include in his New Year's freedom to care for our poor countrymen and concern for the people not only for those who are here in the Philippines but also in other countries.
Hopefully, change and fighting against corruption will strengthen by the Aquino administration like what he is proud of in other countries, but hopefully, the truth will be their news and not the actions that the Aquino administration is facing.
Opponent in politics.
But, if we study and analyze, corruption in the time of Aquino is severe than the time of Arroyo because it is bigger than the number of agencies involved in corruption.
There is still hope that the New Year's call of people from the government should be Goodbye corruption, hopefully it's as if the person who owns the change in his administration can't look pitiful.
