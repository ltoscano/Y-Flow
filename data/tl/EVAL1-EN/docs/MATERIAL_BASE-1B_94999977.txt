Young snatchers or VK are everywhere in Pasay.

Three young fisherman who are members of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) were reported by the AFP who were included in their killed last week.
Because of this, the Palace was alarmed and condemned the BIFF's restriction on their young warriors are publicized!
If you think about it, it is really wrong that even minors just include the BIFF in their war.
Because it is also wrong, make it a mistake, to make a lot of drug syndicates to attract the children!
Please, if this event will continue, the day will come that a sign of Gat Jose Rizal will be gone.
That the youth are the hope of our country.
The question, is it that when this kind of system has become worse, the minors are always joking with each other?
As a matter of fact, they were not the only accomplices of drugs and culprits who were fighting against the opposition.
Most of them are "drug addict who are involved in their own cases like murder, theft and rape!
Shh, I remember, it is a crush.
Starting to be implemented, typhoon "Pangilinan" stated that the youth give severe protection to the youth.
But the author could not see that the said law will be used and used to use the said law to further strengthen our youth!
That is why, even a barangay chairman was running away by former Senator Kiko Pangilinan, I will not vote for him!
Papal!
