EPR-1 in Malacanang, not in EDSA, free?

It is guilty! This is what we see why President Benigno Aquino III (BGH3) should do the commemoration of the historical EDSA People Power Revolution in Malaca単ang in the true scene in 1986.
Guilty because action of the people is the EPR-1 against the Marcos regime.
The issue here is an issue here and political, that means, if he wants to commemorate the shooting of Gat Jose Rizal, one more than Noynoy is free from Malaca単ang also?
The new administration of Aquino, Sonny Coloma said, is the command of his employer to transfer the history from EDSA going to Malaca単ang, because the motorists are pitiful, and this will be added to the feast of EDSA?
Admit, you admit, Aquino, who can see that you have seen no one who will attend, you will feel the protest of the people that you are thinking of lies!
One of those is the show of the SWS survey recently that the survey rating of Noynoy has increased and those who voted for were victims of Typhoon Nona or Yolanda?
Why don't you release the truth a few days after the latest survey of SWS, almost 15 thousand of those from Leyte and Samar have evacuated, why don't you accept that it has not been given the real help to them?
Coloma said, the decision of Malaca単ang is for the welfare of the people to be a nuisance of strict traffic in EDSA that you know, but how can you keep the "traslacion" in EDSA People Power 1?
You are afraid of the true image and posture because you know no one will attend and if there is a need to attend, the voice of the victims of typhoons, earthquake and flooding that until now are not helped by the truth!
You wasted your chance to serve the country and the people because your term is over, all of your term is just about four years old, not even though it's almost four years already!
A waste of EDSA People Power 1.
