Witnesses: A long trip.
By Jimmy Cantos or July 26, 2016, the six-year-old Pinoy players of the SEA Games that will start on August 5 has arrived in Rio.
It is very long for their trip to eight hours from Manila to Dubai, and after three hours, there are 14 hours going to Rio de Janipan, 25 years of all, even the most important thing that he wants, it will not be happy for the long time of it.
The six members of the team, together with the boxers, Roden Laden and Charishment, are included in the coming days in Rio, and who among our athletes are in a big hope to win even of copper?
They say, the ball was full, but if I will be asked, the chance of Laden and Suarez was the biggest and even by Trisha ena.
What else would it happen? Let us say that I am one of those who believes that they will fight properly.

Hoping that they would make it better.
But we all know that in the Olympics, it is not impossible to happen that there is a luck or miracle when you win a gold medal, it means you are the best.
When did we last wins in the Olympics?
Ah, this is in 1996 with the Atlanta Hawks, Georgia, in America, where the silver medal is in Manongol on "Onyok" Velasco after losing weight in the finals.
After arriving at this, we will not be favored by what we reached in 2000 Sydney Olympics, 2004 Athola, 2008, 2008 and 2012 London.

The filipino masses, who went to the fourth Olympics, but one of them did not have luck in their own good, as they say, it is too much.
What is the difference between our team this 2016 to the team who went to Australia, Greece, China and England, perhaps, many are poor but it is difficult to say.
The only thing that I can be sure is that every one of the twelve filipino athletes who are in Rio are hoping that they will not be able to go home.
If this does not happen, it is certain that their trip will be longer compared to our country.
