It is better to be imprisoned instead of not being imprisoned.

It is estimated that not less than four people will be charged by the Ombudsman in plunder and Gaming Corporation.
Even the four of them are better than not.
Included in the four are Bongbong Marcos, Jinggoy Estrada and his brain Janet Lim-Napoles.
It is likely that ten others are going to be charged with each other, but it's okay, instead of nothing.
Will be charged and put in jail so those who are negligent in their duty should not be killed, not to be killed by the people's money?
Will the cabinet member of President Noynoy Aquino be punished, including the leadership of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo?
Does Butch Abad also have a responsibility to Secretary of Budget, Alcala of the Agriculture or Paje and Labor Law; but they are not included in the Maranao.
Also included in these are the congressman and famous involved in the Napoles scandal.
They are Gigi Reyes, Ruby Tuason, PUPP-Labuan, Richard Cambe, Jose Antonio Evangelista, Rodolfo "Koko" Plaza, Tatsuya Nakamura, Edgar Valdez and Samuel Tumamac.
If they will stop the case and Napoles will be proven guilty, it will be better if there is nothing.
And if Napoles will be jailed, surely it will not be acceptable to the country.
So everyone will be imprisoned, even forty or a road, and be brought to Mslowly and not in Santa Rosa.
But we can't be sure, to remember, Justice Secretary Leila de Lima will still show that she would show it to President Noynoy Aquino as to why, why is he not able to submit it to the Ombudsman?
When the Luneta Detachment of the massacre happened, the same was what de Lima did, he gave the President the result of the investigation and was imprisoned.
