Mayor Manny Alvarez, awake!

We think, that, Mayor Manny Alvarez from Rosario here in the province of Batangas Governor Vilma Santos has no choice but if he is a good mayor, well, he will surely be positive and negative or theme of the discussion.
When mayor was asking for pity for the mayor of Rosario, Oh no, like a sheep in socializing with the people, but when he was elected in position, the wind suddenly changed and he became a bit of bit.
At first, every complaint of the residents, he was immediately acted upon but when he was seated, he stopped the complaint of the residents of Rosario.
And because of this, it was said that it became a mayor, illegal drugs suddenly came out.
Just like the Montenero who are operating the mayor for a long time, but he / she ignores all.
"You said, mayor, is your good Police Chief - C / Insp. Salvador Espina to catch the gambling place," that is said to be very serious.
It is convenient because their father went to school, as well as their mothers, who are the wives and members of the family were addicted to playing mahjong.
Chona Kucia smelled the those behind the Montenero in Rosario who are Jun Ayalin, Nixon Ilagan and Celso Katidtuan after Mayor, take action on the complaint of your countrymen.
