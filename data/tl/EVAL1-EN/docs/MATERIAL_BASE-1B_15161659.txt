Manila, Philippines - A Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim made certain that he is ready to cooperate with Mayor-elect Joseph Estrada to improve the services of the Manilenanigan.
Lim said that the new officials of the city government should also show that they will focus on the needs of the residents of Manila.
The residents of Manila allegedly need the help of officials of the government to rise from poverty.
Lim denied that he turned his back on his duty in the city after being defeated by the former President in the recently concluded elections.
He said, his response to duty as the father of Manila will continue in the remaining days of his term.
According to him, he said, there will be a proper transfer of power to the newly-elected officials of the city on June 30, 2013.
In the Holy Week, I have been there in Manila at around eight o'clock in the morning, working, hard to sign paper, what needs to be made into a job, "Lim said.
