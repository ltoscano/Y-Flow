Word case in Spratings.

The conflict between China and the Philippines is already severe.
Senator Antonio Trillanes and Foreign Affairs Secretary Alberto del Rosario are also serious.
Trillanes is the one responsible for President Noynoy in the peace talks with China and the Philippines about the conflict between South China Sea or the Philippine Sea under the Spratly Islands.
Del Rosario meanwhile, according to Trillanes, was the former caretaker of Manny V. Pangilinan (MVP) who has a contract to find oil in the sea of Recto Bank in Palawan.
When China won in Sprateng, the business of MVP is dead in the Philippine Sea.
That is said to be the reason why China and MVP are so out of power to get the Spratamak.
It is said that Recto believes that this is the biggest oil competition in the South China Sea which is formally called the Philippine Sea of PNoy.
But in this fight, Trillanes and Del Rosario and China are in the Philippines, two personalities are just quiet: The church (Catholic, Iglesia, resident, others, and the NPA Party of the Philippines.
Maybe the church is too busy in fighting with the Reproductive Health (RH) bill that's why he does not want to meddle with the war, of Spratings.
Like this in the World War.
The Pope does not want to meddle in the war in Europe and Asia even if millions of people die in war.
Also does not want to meddle with the religious groups in the territorial dispute with Spratings.
And before I forget it, China has a new policy that China will rule out.
The Chinese can be increasing even if they have 1.5 billion pesos.
Because, more soldiers are more aggressive, and more workers will increase and more of their Overseas Filipino workers will increase.
With the number of Chinese people in the world, we are really out here.
And the CPP has no clear statement about the Spratings.
CPP is an ally of the country China and not the Philippines.
