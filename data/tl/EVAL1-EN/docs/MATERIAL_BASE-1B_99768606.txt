The Philippines will rise especially to PNoy.

The improvement of the economy of the country continues because of the good leadership and straight management of President Noynoy Aquino.
Even in other countries, respect for the Philippines will return again because what we are taking right now is right because it is a right and righteous person to lead the state.
If in the past, we have been observing the country in Asia, but it is clear now because it is clear in the opinion of international community especially the economists of the world to progress especially the country of Juan dela Cruz.
It is also clear in the report of K@-@ year Frank Drilon this 2012, the Philippines is now investigating the countries in the world with the fastest growth of economy and that is due to the proper governance of PNoy.
In the said report, transparency should be the primary reason for the current administration to attack the primary reasons why the economy of the country is going up and the country can prove that the businessmen are going to prove it.
It is also clear that our small countrymen are not making noise in poverty because they see and feel the change in the course of life during the time of PNoy.
What the President said is right, good luck, good manners "because they can see the result of his" straight path. "
As a matter of fact, up to 6.1 percent of 1st Infantry Batallion (GDP) of the country and that is a good thing to say that the Philippines is in the right path again.
We know that our path will still be far to achieve real progress but what PNoy has started is a strong belief that we will prove to the whole world as long as we will prove the whole world as long as we will prove that the Filipino is together.
