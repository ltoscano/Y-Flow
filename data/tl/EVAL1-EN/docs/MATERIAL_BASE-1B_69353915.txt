Thank God.

Do you know how to thank God?

- if you are able to finish your child even if the disease is difficult, please give thanks to the Lord.

If you buy your own lot, house, house and knife, -- give thanks to the Lord.

Thank God.

You have good ideas that give thanks to the Lord.

Your livelihood became good, you can see that you are getting thankful that you give thanks to the Lord.

The person you married is beautiful or handsome, -- give thanks to the Lord.

Get healed by illness, please give thanks to the Lord.

You have been passed for a point, give thanks to the Lord.

You have a high grades in partner, thank you for God.

You answered your lover, give thanks to the Lord.

You have received a bonus, give thanks to the Lord.

All your prayer is that you are going to be given protection -- -- give thanks to the Lord.

In good news trends by Jesus, it is only one who came back and thanked for one person who gave a huge blessing, but one of the one who gave the right meaning of debt of gratitude and gave time to see and thanked Jesus.

In these times, there are a lot of grace that has a lot of blessing, a lot of blessing in material things, Shuler, physical and emotional when it comes to God, but they are shy!

You are selfish!

You are like a student who does not want to study so you will be a teacher who does not want to teach.

In life, giving thanks to God for the blessings given is not only through words.

We show thanks to the Lord if we share this.

Blessing will be a real blessing if you will share it to you.

You have a lot of misunderstanding that you cannot live there, remember those who have no homes.

If you have a lot of admiration, it is just these times when you remember people who have nothing to eat.

So you already have a lot of ways, do not put all of it and remember those who do not wear it.

Let us imitate the person who will be taken by Jesus.
