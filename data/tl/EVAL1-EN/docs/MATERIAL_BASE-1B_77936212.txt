Now is the feast of San Pedro and San Pablo, they fulfilled the instructions of Jesus to study the words of God for them to study their blood and other men who were watering the lessons of Jesus.
Pedro (the stone) is the foundation of the church built by Jesus, Jesus said to him: "You are lucky with the key of the kingdom of heaven; I will give you all the key to the kingdom of heaven; I will give you all the key to the earth and the expression that you make in heaven."
This is the true foundation of the true church built by Jesus in the attempt of Jesus Christ for any challenge to management of Jesus, "I am sure that everything is true and I was saved from the hands of Hernaez and they are saved from the hands of Hernaez."
Even Pablo in spite of the prosecution's prosecution to the people of Jesus, Lord said that the Lord asked me and gave him strength to submit his words to express Him for danger.
That's why the true church led by Pedro starting until now that's why Papa is full of three words in Pega, Apostol, Poneagx, Acu√±a.
