How much?

How much is the money being spent by someone running for a position in politics?
According to the law, the running for the president should only be spent for ten (P10 million pesos for each of the voters and the candidates for other positions, the budget of every voters is only up to five pesos.
Many say that this law is not being followed.
According to the COMELEC, it is greater than 50million voters that have been registered to the election in 2013.
An example is a candidate for a district with 1 million voters that should be eaten by no more than 2,000 pesos and a senator who will vote for the entire country should not be the act of more than P250M.
But what if the COMELEC should monitor this, how can they take a check on their system to ensure that there will be no violation of the law?
Our point here is how the violation of the law of the COMELEC is about the expenses of the candidates every election is the reason why we cannot reach it, as a country, our dream of Calaguas.
I believe that many candidates are just taking advantage of the law, but there are those who violate the law, but there are also those who violate the law, and oftentimes, what the people want is to have the worthy leadership through clean election.
When the COMELEC promised that they will strictly implement the "campaign Rules and especially in the election 2013, they should have thought that it will be strict on how the real expenses of politicians should be considered.
Because it is important to stop the illegal activities that are taking advantage of the desired Filipinos.
Just like an example of expenses for the vote buying and black propaganda and expenses for the government which are taking advantage of the people who are taking advantage of the people who are poor voters.
