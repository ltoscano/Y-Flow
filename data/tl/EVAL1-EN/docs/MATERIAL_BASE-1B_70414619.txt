There is no weather for Senator Enrile.

Is it really good for a Juan Ponce Enrile or naturally, the history is really kind to him?
Do you see, 88-year-old man from the province of Cagayan, which is currently the leader of the Senate, is still under the politics of the country.
Even during the impeachment trial of former Chief Justice Renato Corona, the Senate President really ignited because he knows what he said and doing during the midst of the trial.
Since the time of former President Ferdinand Marcos, Enrile has been on top of the time of former President Cory Aquino, Fidel Ramos, Erap Estrada, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and now in the administration of President Noynoy Aquino.
In short words, Enrile is better to mingle with or play because he can keep up with the flow of politics even during whose time.
Just like what Senator Antonio Trillanes revealed that Enrile allegedly talked to Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, it seems that there is truth because Enrile did not even respond, which is one of the brains of the law in his sins to the country.
We have not received any news that was filed with Manong Johnny aside from Cory's time, that's why he was dismayed, this is where the lawmaker is admirable because he was able to swim in the flow of a cauldron.
Even though it was never mentioned where the wealth of Enrile came from, when others were really investigating the critics from the head to feet.
Is the history of Manong Johnny really kind or if Enrile is really good to gather everything?
Questions that is hard to answer because Enrile has two years in politics because his term is finished at the age of 92 years old.
It is certain that the people will also be held accountable for Enrile by his son Jackie's candidacy, who is one of the candidate of UNA, who is also one of the leaders of the UNA, where Enrile is still one of the leader and protagonist.
Wait for it!
