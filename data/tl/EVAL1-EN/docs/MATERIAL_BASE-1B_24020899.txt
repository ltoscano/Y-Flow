Alexander at the great, it is Charisine of great, it is Constantine who is considered as Herbs for great, Pavors of the Great, John Paul II of Great, John Paul II and Great God, but for what they have done for the economic growth, but for Jesus who is the best?

Jesus: "We are being servile, like this small child, he is the symbol of people who have no voice in the society, people who do not know how to look down from the heart of God, the people who have no names in the heart of God, the people who do not know how to face the best players of the community in heaven," that is why they are experiencing the best players in the whole world.
