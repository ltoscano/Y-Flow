Will focus on love?

The weather is slow for those who are waiting, it was very fast for those who are afraid, very long for those who are afraid, and so that it is very short for those who are walking, but for those who are in love, the time has been postponed.

You can measure your great love.

In a separate court, your married life is a close friend, whom I want to know if you have the ability to love my husband, "what I want is to love her husband, but how will I understand if my love is really enough," what I really love is enough and making me happy? "The fragrance of one another."

"You will ask yourself well and you will be able to give yourself to yourself, or, you will be able to listen to your feelings, and instead you are making your real feelings, and instead of you making your real feelings, you will not be measured.
