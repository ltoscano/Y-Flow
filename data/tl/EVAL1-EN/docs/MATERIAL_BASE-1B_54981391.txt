Will we be worried about corruption?

Many are asking if Parañaque was liberated from corruption.
This is what is noticeable in the city because corrupt officials of the city are still scattered, especially the people who were pulled out of a city in northern part of Metro Manila.
The harassment of Lani and his accomplices, Anton and Arnold.
It is certain that the actions of Anton, Lani and Arnold because of a lot of money are being discussed now that 2014 ends.
Mayor Edwin Olivarez should be observant at work of those who are going to be observant because this is what he will get to the people because if you lose the faces of them, it is certain that 3 people will come out.
Not only is the name and the political administration of Mister Edwin, which is two o'clock in the system of Anton, Lani and Arnold because it is certain that even the town of Parañaque will surely be affected.
Especially now that no permit will be paid for the business and other First Division, the mayor and the City Council should be observant and there will be sure that half will be lost in their place.
In spite of this, it took a doctorate in these kinds of money when they are talking about money, and that is what the COA and mayor should monitor.
