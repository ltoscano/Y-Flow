SSS!

According to SSS Vice President May Catherine Cirilos who was filed in the release of Lendatas, the said pensioners needs to submit a direct form of the barangay chairman, or with a sabotage of their house that was declared by the barangay chairman, Department of Social Welfare and Development or maybe from the NDRRMC.
It is possible for a Permanent Partial Disability to send additional pension for their remaining months with their benefits, but, do not eat too much of three months.
If the address of the Pambansang Kamao has been in the area, the NDRRMC is already in a state of calamity, just like in our dancee, the application for distress will be accepted even if there is no direct effect, he even explained.
To those who are taking advantage of the new calamity areas, it will be considered to be exported from Salombies (SPARP), who will give them a chance, to renew their Quicken Loans Arena, which is the first time to renew their regular amount.
The SSS is very intelligent that their one-cent services will also be measured by the removal of what they're applying for, both of the new and uneateries, so that the affected members will be helped.
The affected members may also be able to get the said amount of pork meat and it is almost 6 percent the interest rate for the lower house to repair the Implementing Rules and Quicken Loans Arena until 1 million peso.
The deadline to send the deadline to organize what we are applying for "Agaton" is in the coming election, April 30, 2014, our eltek is only one year from the field of my SSS, to prepare for their application.
