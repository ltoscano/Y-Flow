The LP is in Marikina before and now.

Tomorrow morning, a certificate of candidacy of Mayor Del R. de Guzman and the entire Liberal Party in Marikina is tomorrow morning.
We are expecting that de Guzman, Vice Mayor Jose Fabian, and Representative Miro Quimbo, and Representative Miro Quimbo, together with those who are hoping to be included in the LP, and local officials are here in COMELEC, in Marikina and the congressman in Intramuros.
We will also know if BF and MCPS is going to run.
Naturally, many are hoping that the couple will run so that the political agenda can run so that the people around them are the ones saying that the couple is going to run.
According to a source that we will hide from the name "dela Cruz, chairman allegedly said in a meeting that he needs to focus on his business especially because of the huge project in Region I for DepEd.
In the news, it is said that this has been added to another big project in Cebu and it seems that the chairman of chairman was OPLAN LS for the presidency because many of their colleagues are not in favor of it.
That's why if we will study it, this is probably the largest Factor why the ranks of LP have increased when he went to a factory in Balai ng Mar Roxas at Araneta Center, Cubao.
Many of those who are in the other parties are going to transfer to the LP after they heard from the mouth of chairman that they will not run.
In my acquaintance with the couple, they are the type who is really looking at work and they will not leave until it has not yet finished yet because their contribution in Marikina is very big.
This is the legacy that all residents of Marikina should be grateful for.
That is why we will know if Mayor Del Rosario in 2013 will have no strong opponent in 2013 or will file the COC of the Two Wives.
