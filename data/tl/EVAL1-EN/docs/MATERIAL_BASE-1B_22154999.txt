I am quiet for P15.B scam.

As of now, Sen. Jinggoy Estrada is very quiet about the accusations that he is involved in the latest pork barrel scam which costs P10 billion pesos.
Jinggoy wants to see the accusations against him before he talks or comment.
It is her right, but his peace is not good for his public image, especially that he is the child of a former president of the country and currently the mayor of Manila.
Many admired Jinggoy about his perseverance against the police and military who are said to be involved in the scam and other anomalies.
But when he was impressed, he disappeared like a trace of trace. If before, he was leading in asking for a Senate hearing against Scuisers, it looks like this time the situation is different.
If that is his head to the generals, he is so cold about the P10 billion pesos which is being linked to Janet Lim Napoles who is accused by Benhur KLuy as the owner of the Ghost of Ghost (NGO).
Poor farmers, they are always victims of Scuishment.
What the country is waiting for, in my opinion, Jinggoy has a brave warning against fake ambulances especially that his name is involved in this corruption.
It is not possible that Senator Jinggoy will also want to be the president of the Philippines one day but maybe his ambition is not happen if there are many people who are really involved in this scam.
The public servant is very important in all election.
