True Love.

(JO 21-1-19)

The Office of a love affair with a love behind bars!

Francis de Castro.

True love is to love without action!

There was one story about a young man who visited a park in his walking while he saw a wallet.

He saw in the three dollars but there was no content of an identification card on the part which is obvious that she had a love affair with her wallet. "She opened it and the former owner was already living there and she pointed out that she was in a home for the former owner.

He went there and was able to talk with Hannah, he showed the wallet and the letter and she said she did not know where she was waiting for Michael and she said that she did not know where the young man did not know how to return the wallet.

He is already out of the building when the guard saw his wallet.

The owner of the owner, Michael who lives in the 8th floor when they went there and saw Hannah for a long time, and she was able to hide the last letter of Hannah, she was brought to Hannah in their meeting after a long waiting.

One week after that, the young man received a call.

He invited her to be invited to the wedding of Michael and Hannah in the home for the revenge.

Use to determine the real love is to love without action!

In good news trends by Jesus, the real meaning of love for him was left and her head was already returned to their former life and he was the one who approached them and did not continue to go back to Jesus.

Even if Pedro gave you three times, Jesus gave it a chance to make it up to her three times when he loves Jesus.

And because of this love, he is ready to accept any kind of team as if its mission is to be defeated by Jesus who is even trusted by Jesus who would be the one to take care of the Lord.

Is your love really true? We always remember the love of Jesus.

Let us remember: "To determine the real love is to love without action!"
