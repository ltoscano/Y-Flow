Lessen and fraud in Southern Mindanao.

The country.
March 7, 2012.
It is clear in Southern Mindanao for a sativity that was used in the territory of the Marcos US-Aquino - the program, Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino (4Ps).

In Police District, Davao City, the masses criticized the arrested farmers and small businessmen in the list of beneficiary of the 4Ps, while the DSWD is not on the list of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the DSWD will reveal who will be the beneficiary of the program 4Ps.

This is also the case in the towns of Laak, Monkayo and Montevista Compostela Valley because their relatives and close friends who are usually rich are rich farmers.

It is tiring, chaotic and expensive to spend for protection from far places coming from far places, they still need to spend for the fare of their motorcycles for just a small help but there are a few who are still being spent on fare if they receive its subsidy.

Arbring to the list of common beneficiary and other places in Davao City, those who are living in the barangays who are in the boundary of the voters, especially if they were not included in the latest list of voters because they do not vote last election.

In Pagulangan, Bukidnon, the military prohibited for women to join the senior citizens who have connections with the masses, not only to stop the fight of the poor people but to divert the struggle of poor cities for society, inhumane salary and work.
