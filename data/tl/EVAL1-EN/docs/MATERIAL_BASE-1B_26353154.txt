QC, "epal."

It is a good thing that Senator Miriam Santiago's call became more alive against the politicians who were extremely fooled and did not do anything but to dry on each post and the corner of the street their faces and names.
The call of this kind of politician is to be "epal." That's why Miriam called the proposed law of the Anti-bala scam.
It is the purpose of the law of Miriam that they should be punished and penalize anyone who would be proven guilty of funds of the government so that it would be "epal."
Because Miriam is from Quezon City because it is possible that she will comeback because every day she is going out of the house, there will be no obstacle to the tarpaulins of the "epal."
Maybe no one will argue with me if I say I can already be called the National Capital of the Philippines.
Why is it?
Well, there is no regard for, corner, post, post and even trees beside the road, you can see that there are no tarpaulins.
No matter what time it is going to stay in the area, you can see the faces of those (U), I mean, "epal" and Vice Mayor Joy Belmonte.
It can also be seen for a lot of tarpaulins for councilor and councilor such as Sitti, Alfred Vargas, Candy Medina, Aarongis, Goitia, Winnie Castelo and many other (U), I mean, "epal."
We are not included there are the congressmen in the city that all of us are all Mae "epal" but even just a simple celebration, is being made into a simple celebration.
I know it is big and it has even reached millions in the budget of those in their campaign to boast.
Maybe it is better that they put their faces to the public, they have to allocate their money to the programs that are beneficial for their poor jurisdiction.
That is why I am happy that in the past few days, the anti-" epal "will be more alive and hopefully the" epal "will be ashamed because they will take the initiative to change and remove their tarpaulins.
Like Senator Miriam, our countrymen are already disgusted with me and I am together there.
