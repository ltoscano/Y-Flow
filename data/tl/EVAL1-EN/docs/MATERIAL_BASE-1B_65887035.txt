Lola EDick? "?: Mark and Winwyn Marquez, in 2018.
"Jen, the ultimate empanada," -- Mark.

Mark Herras is happy and believes in his fellow ultimate winner of StarStruck along 1, which is one of his ultimate ex-girlfriend, Jennylyn Mercado, for the title given by the Kapuso network, the ultimate Star.
Mark said, it is said that Jennylyn is going to work hard and all of the actors given the title have worked hard, that according to him, Mark has also mentioned anything to him because he really worked hard for whatever he is doing now.
That's why we have asked Mark to visit her when she was visited by some press during the taping of the afternoon of by Yasmien Kurdi and Katrina Halili, which is why she also doesn't want to give a title for Jennylyn and the very first ultimate winner of StarStruck that she would be the first ultimate winner of StarStruck.
"It is natural for me, is it a ultimate revenge?!

Oh, "
But Mark does not want to say that he does not want to know that he does not want to get to know him, but because he is just going to know whatever is given to him, after 13 years, she is still here in showbiz and they have not given her good.
Because of Mark, it's because the actress got insecure so he was not really the actor who got insecure in fact, he / she's still not caring, especially with someone new.
On the other hand, there are a lot who noticed that Mark has been sick as well as it seems that he and her grandchildren are even more suspicious, especially in her relationship with Winwyn Marquez, who is the sister of Auto, Jonas, who will be in the company of Nanay Cion.
Many years have been given by Mark to himself so that he will become more than his girlfriend, she is really with his girlfriend, duh! In 2018, which is why the wedding?
