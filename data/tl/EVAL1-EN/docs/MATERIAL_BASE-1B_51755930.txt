The Editorial Department of Bangkal, farmer is always pitiful.

Rosalinda L. Orosa (Pilipino Star Ngayon) - March 29, 2015 - 12: 00am.

Small farmers are always pitiful in this country, instead of them going to be protected by the government and they need to protect their lives, there is also a need to ruin the typhoon or a lot of calamity that the typhoon or the farmer might destroy and win.
Just like what is happening to those who plant onions, it seems that what they are experiencing is a big nightmare that is why when they will be able to protect the farmers in the market and the local farmers allowed the farmers to protect the farmers in the market, and the local farmers allowed to protect the farmers in the market, and the local farmers allowed to protect the farmers.
The farmers asked to separate the newspaper and it is not beneficial but the goodness of local farmers, also asked by the farmers to resign from the DA Secretary Proceso Alcala.
At present, Alcala and former senator Francis Pangilinan, are two of the former senator Francis Pangilinan, but instead of the lives of small farmers, they are submerged in a quicksand of poverty.
