DSWD and local government of Foreign SETC.

Welfare Secretary Dinky Soliman recently revealed that they are not politicking the assigned resolution of the victims of the victims of the typhoon Yolanda or our dear president after typhoon Yolanda hit them first (Malacanang, Et al) and their allies in politics.
It was said that the official of Benigno Aquino is said to have been reported that if he would be certain of Beata, it would be better if the arrival of help is certain, because it is not an ally of the Liberal Party that's why they are not allies in giving help to those affected?
"It is true that if it is true that the help of Congresswoman Lucy Gomez is true, the help of Malaca√±ang is serious with politics, if in things, Eve said that it is just weather."
Recently, our fellow countrymen have arrived from Canada and America, they have a help of food, clothes, food, soap, delata and others, they also give assistance to DSWD to coordinate with them.
The thing is, Dinky said that it is just for them to give them the things they are carrying and they are the one who will take care of them while they are talking, they look at the people who are destroying the box, box and will not be sent to help by the foreigners.
They can clearly see the change of a bag from the box going to the special DSWD bag and name of PNoy!
Here is what is worse, he said that our countrymen from other countries have told him to send their donation, and to give their donations, they are obliged to pay the DSWD because if not, they will have to pay taxes because they will pay taxes!
The truth is, I do not want to give other criticism and criticisms against the regime of Noynoy Aquino, that I also want to help all our countrymen, in my Facebook and Twitter account, this is the reason why the complaints against me Miss Soliman, can this be considered as an enemy?
