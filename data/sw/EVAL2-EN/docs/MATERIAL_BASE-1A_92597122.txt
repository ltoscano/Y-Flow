The nominated member of parliament, Jacqueline Ngonyani (CCM) has advised the bill of the availability of information of the year 2016 to be maintained together with the law in order to control the rumor and a misleading reports that were done concurrently, while giving a rumor of the resignation of the Vice President, Samia Suluhu Hassan.

, Ngonyani has said that yesterday in parliament in Dodoma town, when he was contributing to the debate of the bill of the availability of information.
He has said that he is true and started using the use of those laws there.
I don't mention you, and great skill that produces false from every day.
He said that apart from the rumor, no fact that the request for Samia wants to resign as the vice president, another recent months being distributed by President John Magufuli has appointed Jerry Muro as the assistant director of the department of communication in the state, though it was not any truth.
However, Gerson Msigwa has been confirmed by President Magufuli recently to hold that position which for more than eight years was being held by Salva Rweyemamu, retired last year, contributing to the debate, he continued to say.
"The other day before yesterday the rumor of Jerry Muro and Msigwa (Gerson) that President has confirmed to be the executive director of the State House and his assistant, Muro.
So there's a rumor and now I think this law will be careful.
