The call for the organizing committee for the national debate which has been put in climate, in the country since the head of Correa scored in the country from America, is supposed to be dealt with through political tensions and the opposition side and the opposition.
Instead of checking the blame that could bring together with disrupting peace in the country, both sides are forced to put in mind the importance of talks in the country.
President Uhuru Kenyatta said that his government had planned to prepare a national debate as well as the opposition, it has been putting off from a result of being involved in politics.
Up to now, it is clear that every side explains that there is need for talks with the aim of strengthening the lives of Kenyans.
Therefore, instead of giving the politicians reason to be able to make Kenyans, the government is supposed to connect all Kenyans, by bringing together various issues concerning our country, where we have forgotten their duties as well as religious leaders who have forgotten their responsibilities in order to provide the community the direction of ethics and to take a political party that protects you.
It's not the secret that since the last general elections, Kenyans have divided into consideration of political lines, political and even religious, and it is through a debate together where the constitution can be found.
Other countries like Taliban militants, Nigeria and Malawi that involve their citizens in the national debate that has given them fruits and we can take action as required to move forward as a nation.
