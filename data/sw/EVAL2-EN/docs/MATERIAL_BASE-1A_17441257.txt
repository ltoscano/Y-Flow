Sihana Nkinga and Hoja because Lowassa voted for CCM and joined CHADEMA.

The beautiful lady Slaa may be the opposition politician who is in the country and was heard more in Tanzania.

All this is a reason for his stand to oppose corruption, managing and defending the national exams without fear.

He has touched me in the list of 11 suspects, Lowasa in number nine and Kikwete in number ten and one.

He went to Arumeru district he accused Lowasa in corruption and caused the farmers of Arumeru East and took that Monduli.

But today we are told that Lowasa will welcome him inside you will continue to be committing which sin?

I don't have a problem with the arrival of Lowassa in my party, my problem is the respect and the picture of Doctor Slaa's picture that he has contributed to a long time to be careful.

Is today he is ready to announce public that Lowasa have been clean and not to be corrupt again, he is ready to reduce the list of the defender of Yanga Yanga from ten and one to remain ten.

Although politics is not a permanent enemy or a permanent friendship, according to I see the respect of sending Slaa and the member of parliament as a whole.

That respect to Doctor Slaa's honor has been blocked to be careful, but we pray to corruption, but we're going on the state and that you will allow the party to protect themselves on corruption.

I am just a view, stakeholders do not sell yourself to hatred.
