One of the most important means that makes youths to enter the universities about the importance of getting livelihood instead of relying on employment.
This is as a result of having employment that are there very few, compared to the number of youths who qualify to universities and other higher education institutions every year.
The government has set several strategies to enable youths to come out and be self-employed through the existence of different ways of giving loans and also to increase youth part of the tender that was announced by the public institutions.
However, these government programs will not succeed as required if the youths will not be able to change their views about how they can go in life without being employed in the institutions and big organizations that are taught.
