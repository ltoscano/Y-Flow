The program of distributing sports equipment in the province of Dar es Salaam and the member of parliament of special seats through a union of youths of the revolutionary party in the country, Mabere Marando has said me do not have a full report that they should have been able to help youths to get more employment.

There is a stakeholder.
Also, he has gotten lost doughnuts.
But as a step.
Those equipment will arrive to pay those equipment.
Chairman of the union of young people with albinism in Butiama, apologized and giving thanks for the support of those equipment, he urged the youths who were given those pictures to ensure we are forced to make sure that we are forced to make sure we get to the sun and if I think we are required to do so like that I have ever done well like that I have ever heard.

Youths of this type.
You take a good thing and be close to him.
