Strategies are required to prevent Ebola in the country.
The government does not have a lot of strategies to prevent any probability of the virus that cause Ebola disease in the country.
Considering the close partnership, especially small and nations like Kenya and nations like Nigeria, it is a must that stern action will be taken to all areas used to travel from those countries to enter the country so that they can be investigated before going into.
It is very worried about how we did not see any statement given earlier by the government to Kenyans traveling towards nations that were affected so that they can help them fully in those nations.
Ebola is known to have the ability to spread very fast because it can be spread when a person knows it or another person who have been infected.
What is doing that disease is very dangerous and how it does not have treatment or vaccination and can cause conflicts in few hours after being infected.
Apart from the international airport, all areas of borders also must be work with health officers who know the way to inspect them in the country and to recognize that they have any signs of Ebola infection.
It is clear that many efforts will continue to put security at the airport areas but it should be remembered that there is a possibility of passengers who come from the nations that were affected in the country through our borders and neighboring countries.
The officers that protect our boundaries for receiving bribes and forgetting their responsibilities, it must know the same to terrorism which has become dangerous because of the size of some of some of them, that disease did not discriminate anyone in the foundations of religion or tribe.
The government intends to ensure health officers have talked to them about how to identify that disease and what they intend to do when there is a person with symptoms of infection.
The virus that causes the disease of Ebola.
