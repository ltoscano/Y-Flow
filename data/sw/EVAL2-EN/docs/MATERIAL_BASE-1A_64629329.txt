Also, Rage has been removed from the chairperson of the soccer party in that province, Yusuph Kitumbo.
After being read to the judgment of that committee, Rage said that basically the committee has made a decision without listening to the defense of those involved.
"The regulations of TFF about the first level league are open, the committee cannot use the Singida Municipality to make a decision instead of using the referee.
"We have used the Singida Municipal report, this is a violation of the regulations, this is not present, go in other parts of CAF (Confederation of African Football) and even FIFA (the International Federation), the judgment of the game being released in accordance to the report of the referee and not the Singida municipality," said Rage.
He added that Kitumbo and Fukeni MEMKWA centers are not given right to be heard in that appeal.
