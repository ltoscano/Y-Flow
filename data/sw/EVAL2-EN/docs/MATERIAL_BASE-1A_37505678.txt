I have separated to Christianity between Mister Maganjila being the wife at a campaign of looking for presidency.

We have managed to be used in many elections, candidates following up with their fellow leaders, in campaign, this situation has been forced to do many questions, especially for my friends of UKAWA which I believe it is one of the ministers who do not like God, but I believe he did in accordance with the law, regulations and procedures.

He has explained that Retired Colonel Kinana that one will not like to see his family going in the presidential campaigns because I don't want my family to be involved or to be approved by the presidency of the country.

I want to tell you this incident that is caused by young children from being carried in position leadership even employment and leaving the children of poor Tanzanians in the streets because they don't fight with it so that this party should be done by all the country to be for all.

Therefore, my wife, I request you to make sure that since we continue with their things and even my brothers, their main responsibility is to remind me for God, so that I commend him to serve Tanzanians in a good heart without evil deeds.
