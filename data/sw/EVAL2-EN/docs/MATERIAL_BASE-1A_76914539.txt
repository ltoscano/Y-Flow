Approximately one hundred years old people who were being held by the Islamic militants in a factory for producing gas in the south of Congo have been killed and more than 100 others were unknown.
The Nigerian news agency is for us they are looking for a lot of Islam where the government does not see the factory and we see the employees like the hostage.
This is looking for revenue.
I look at each other and you are holding five hundred thousand citizens and during the law.
Where water and foreign citizens who were faced with government forces in the operation was conducted by the army.
Where ten people were two.
And ten eight hostage were killed in that exercise.
