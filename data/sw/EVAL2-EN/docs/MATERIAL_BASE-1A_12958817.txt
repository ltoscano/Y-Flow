Mchaga answered his soul, the Kenyans have gone down.
And Mary Lugusi.
Various feelings are expected to come out among the Kenyans concerning the 13 requirements that were given by the opposition party against Utah Jazz in their meeting that was organized in Saba Saba.
Some of the people have talked about their differences and being surprised when they feel that Khaled claims his goal is to improve the lives of citizens, with actions being contrary to the union, especially considering that you were witnessed as the Saba Saba day.
Although in general, the state has gone up compared to the fear that increased all over the world before bringing in their homes in Saba Saba, some of the community were forced to return their homes, while business people were unable to implement their activities as usual due to fear that spread all over the country.
Controversy, especially the truth about one point of Lufunga because of wanting the existence of opinion polls, many feel that it is a argument that doesn't have any defects or anything because of improper attitude of the various challenges.
They have gotten tired with a very important thing that is facing you, who will fund the activities of paying the committee members to boost the public, considering that Raila Odinga revealed that Raila Odinga got enough from Somalia, in order to restore peace.
Likewise, the argument about being removed from the commission of IEBC indicated that it is not comedy.
Especially if the commission is being faced by a threat to one offense of failing to Raila Odinga, I would like to kill some people of the public sector so as to confirm if he would have taken into consideration the bill at the March 2013 elections, or to identify it soon, considering the question of a news reporter in the foundation stone.
