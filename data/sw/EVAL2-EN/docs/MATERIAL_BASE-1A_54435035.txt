The conflict between the Citizens Party (CUF) has taken a new chapter after the board of board members of the party to go to court, asking a permit to open a case against the registrar of political parties, Judge Francis Mutungi.

Apart from Mutungi, the board was asked to open a case against the national chairperson of CUF, who was alleged to have resigned, Professor Ibrahim Lipumba and 12 members of that party who were suspended.
The board presented those statements yesterday afternoon at the High Court in Dar es Salaam through the party's lawyer, Juma Nassoro, and signed by 75 percent of the year 2016.
The decision by the board went to court due to the conflict that is going on in that party after Professor Lipumba was admitted to the chairmanship on August 6 this year, to announce his return to that position because Judge Mutungi gave a statement that Lipumba is still the legal chairperson of that party.
Speaking to journalists about that case, lawyer Nassoro, said that the request of wanting to open that case and asked the court to give an order to urge Judge Mutungi to get involved in political issues outside the authority, regulations and regulations of the political parties.
He said the request for the court to get a permit for getting the court's order to destroy the registrar not to get involved in political issues outside the authority that was given by the regulations and regulations of political parties.
"Save the court it would like to give a commandment that gives a nuisance to the registrar's authority but you are not sure we want the court to make sure the registrar can put it against the authority that was given," said Nassoro.
He added that the board was at the court to present the request of wanting to open a case, that is the legal action, therefore there is no two board inside CUF.
