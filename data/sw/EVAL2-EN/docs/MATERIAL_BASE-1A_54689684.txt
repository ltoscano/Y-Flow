The government has urged the players of Kilimanjaro Women's team who are going to participate in the World Cup Tournament which took place in Uganda not to be an actor in those competitions but to ensure they are playing the first position for women's teams in East Africa countries.

Those competitions are expected to start tomorrow until September 20 in the capital city of Uganda.
That statement was issued by the provincial commissioner of Kagera, Major General Salum Kijuu in his office in the city yesterday, when he left the players who were one way to Uganda after playing friendly matches with the women team of Burundi.

"Sports is health, it's also a health service, it's also entertainment that is done by every person in the world, remember that you are going to a country of people with their culture, you remember that you are going to make our country not good," said Kijuu.
He said the competition is one of the way to strengthen and maintain the cooperation of the East African Community in that country by using that opportunity to learn that will benefit us to our nation.
