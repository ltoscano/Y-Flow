Itilima has handed 1 billion shillings to buy desks.
Itilima and Council of councilors of Itilima District, Simiyu Province, has agreed on a loan of 1 billion shillings for the purpose of buying desks.
The council is being faced with a shortage of 21,000 desks, a situation that causes students to study while seated on the floor.
Acting Director of that council, Kelvin MatWambura said those agreements were arrived at yesterday.
"The council ordered those funds to the Tanzania Human Resources Bank (TIB) with the aim of completing the shortage of desks."
He said.
Wambura said after the meeting they were given recommendations at the financial committee so as to discuss and give them to the councilors' council to allow those funds to be discussed.
Previously, the councilor of Kinapa Ward (UVCCM), Jackson Chove said the proposal and claimed that the council is alleged to have 20 million shillings that were borrowed for the purpose of construction of laboratory.
"It's impossible to continue to increase the huge debt to that amount when the council is still alleged to have another debt from the CRDB Bank," said the councilor that was supported by other councilors of the party. However, the chairman of the council, Daud Nyambo said that they are organized to implement the directive by President Magufuli that by June 30th, the problem of the desks should be resolved.
He said one of the strategies is to borrow the funds of making desks and to buy laboratory equipment for secondary schools.
