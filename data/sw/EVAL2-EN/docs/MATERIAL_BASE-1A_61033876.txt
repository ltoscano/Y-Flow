Minister close to him.
Thank you a sister is called Christopher and understood well.
Regarding this topic of Simba and Yanga I think it is something that is heading to them.
It is a shame.
Jokate is due to what I cannot have the first team is very big in what?
It is coming back behind there are different competitions.
These teams have been unable to defend our country or in America.
Now, then they have remained in the internal matches now, it means that it has a meaning.
It means that they fear the current money from the fans.
Now.
Therefore, as a result of lack of fear now, they don't know the importance of asking the fans that why you have reached the end of a huge cost and then I have decided to inform others who are not aware if those players are not aware if those players are not aware if those players are similar to those who are proud because those players are proud because they are proud of such attitude.
