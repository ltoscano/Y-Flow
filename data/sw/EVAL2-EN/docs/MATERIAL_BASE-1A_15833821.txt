The delegates of the council of representatives have stopped the bill for the establishment of the Higher Education Institution in Zanzibar where they had insisted on the issue of inspection of teachers to students in their studies due to the drop in education standards and the performance of the national exams.

While contributing to the bill, the representative of Fuoni Province, Yussuf Hassan Iddi, said the development of students have been suffering from day because there is no inspection done for teachers against students in Unguja and Pemba schools.
"We believe that education has reduced, Zanzibar together with our students doing badly in their national exams because the teachers don't have inspection, to know the development of their students in the school," he said.
The representative of the Chake-Chake region, Suleiman Lolila has urged the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training to consider the interests of the teachers as a result of the great work they provide.
He said that the action of the teachers to be given low interests of salaries at a large extent contribute to the drop in the great shape and that is the source of students to fail to succeed in their national exams.
Responding to the motion, the Minister of Education and Vocational Training, Riziki Juma Pemba, said that the presence of higher education institutions will help strengthen the education sector and to check the whole trend of curriculum and the performance of students.
Moreover, he said that in that bill the issue of development of private schools has been allowed where they will be available of fees that will be accepted by the institution.
