I don't have sure that the Swahili Council has already contributed a correct way and the real words of Swahili that owns the meaning of life or even so, I have no doubt about the use of these words in the community of people who like to do exercises for many.
We agree on that, there is a little controversy in the use of these two words, this situation is also in the use of these words in the English language, but these words have the same way, but these words are used to use it, but another thing is used to use the word "said there.
Take a good example of exercises for you to be major, walking or run at a normal speed.
I have said that in a normal speed for a fast speed (SMS), if a person receiving 100 or 200 meters, the criteria for having a great speed or in a human language usually increased and be high for the whole period when they do exercise.
It is easy to know this changes we are doing this kind of exercise and the main aim of increasing the speed of heart rate, especially those who do not have an extra job during exercise, "we don't know this is the one that enables the availability of strength in time to be major or not there.
Now, we had said two things, the speed of the heart rate and the aim of taking enough climate, which does not get enough to your muscles, it means this kind is due to the fact that exercises for this kind will increase the speed of heart rate.
But also, this exercise may increase the speed of fighting for pneumonia.
