I was given keenly, I wanted to lead women "Nisubiri" which has been Mbaya, a lady of Damu Salama's wife.

I hope my son is good, when I was I would like to see girls, I was like I am very much for women to be my friend, I met with young people in our village, I met with youths from our village, when I met my grandfather who has a good medicine for those things.

Because of what I was like, I would like to know if I told me when I told her husband, I arrived to take that medicine, I arrived at the same way, I told me that I am pleased with the drug trafficking as compared to the blood I don't know where I don't know what is wrong.

After blaming each other and drinking water, the grandfather was told from that day there is no woman who will lead you for now, but I was born with any woman that I met and I have tried to eat the money for many women.

I have refused to ask for a woman to take away from maybe that you have not been present at the day before yesterday between my sister and he has started that, he has never been forced to tell me what he has decided to tell me what he has decided to remove it but he didn't give me what he didn't want me.

Therefore, this medicine is impressed me, I will let me use it.

I request for your advice.
