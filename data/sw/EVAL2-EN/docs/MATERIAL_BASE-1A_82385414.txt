The Provincial Commissioner of Dar es Salaam, Paul Makonda has called for the industries and companies to come out to participate in the campaign of "my tree" that are expected to be launched on October first this year by planting trees in that province, so as to ensure the city is still a good view.

He has also urged the residents of that town to make sure that each one goes for his tree and takes a day of one launch to participate in the tree.
"We did not have been able to rise up in five years, one of our aim is that we saw the city is growing up for the way that will enable you for every one, come out in the residents of this province to see them feel." He said.
Makonda made the statement yesterday when he visited various areas of the city that will be planted trees at Mwalimu Nyerere area at the airport area, he said many companies and industries have been destroying the environment including allowing water, an issue that causes the city to have a unsatisfactory performance.
"It is the responsibility of every resident of the city to participate in that campaign and it is also important for the ones with industries to come out in this important day which will change the whole day of the city," said Makonda.
He also said that in that campaign they are expecting to climb more than four million shillings that will sell the whole city. On his part, the head of Ilala district, Sophia Mjema, said that the tree planting exercise in the province will be sustainable and will not end on October first after the launch of that campaign.
