Those who give the human body of human beings will be put in the dock, they did not want it.

The scandal of being jailed for a human body without following the procedure was brought down cinema halls as four officers from the University of Health and Technology (ITU), were taken to court in Dar es Salaam.

Those officers who are inspiring.

After the charges go to be read by the procedures of bail to be completed while one of them is unable to fulfill the conditions, those suspects were sent back to the dock to oppose the charges against the Director of Public Service (DDP) who received the documents of having an intention to continue with those charges.

However, the joy they received that suspect, Vanessa Mdee Hah (57), Stalah (48), Pristeray (64), since the police who were in court there were arrested again and left with them.

The charges are broken.

While those accused while completing procedures of bail while inside that court, the government's lawyer, Salum Ahmed entered and asked the court to reach the case under section 91 (1) by the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) and has no need to continue the charges against them.

That section of the law gives the DPP authority to put the case at the court at any time when he sees no need to continue the charges against any person.

After being presented in that request, Judge Rusimbi said that the accused of those accused without any conditions.

The executive committee was found.

A short time after those accused were free, they started from court for joy but not happy and it was to end the whole process of that court, because they met the police who arrested him again and stop under security.

While those accused were under the defense, their lawyer, Hasheem Mkenyi and explained his disappointment with that act, claiming that DPP does not tell its customers and they will not be free so that he can be able to listen to other charges that are not enough.
