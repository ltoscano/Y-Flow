Towards the match of old rivals Yanga and Simba at the end of this week, former Simba striker, Kelvin Mhagama has given a big position that his team emerged victorious in the game.

Apart from Simba, Mhagama has also bought Mtibwa Sugar of Morogoro, Majimaji of Songea, CDA of Dodoma and fate of Rwanda at different times.
Speaking to this newspaper yesterday, Mhagama said he did a chance to Simba playing for Yanga as a result of a stern legal action led by the citizens of Burundi, Laudit Mavugo from Tanzania Ibrahim Ajib.
He said another reason to give Simba victory is because of having the attackers, Burundi in a goal, a situation that is dangerous to the defenders together with the goalkeeper.
"Shiza Kichuya at how she is looking for 18 years now is dangerous because it is dangerous to that when you feel it is a penalty and the one that will stop Yanga," he said.
