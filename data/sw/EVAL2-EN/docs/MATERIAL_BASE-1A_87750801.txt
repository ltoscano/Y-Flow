And the union of women of the revolutionary party in the Democratic Party, Jilala (Kinondoni) in the city and to comfort patients to give various donations being part of the commemoration of six and six months since the birth of the party is a report.
While speaking at the Ocean Road Hospital, the chairperson of that union Yanga, Mizengo Pinda has said that the hospital need to get better services to patients, not women and other leaders of the ruling party, we saw there is need for me up to give their condolences and educate them on behalf of his leadership.
.
And on behalf of our salvation, I would like to give our thanks for us.
.
The leadership of Clouds FM, together with its members, as a general, he could not recognize the union of women of the revolutionary party to comfort the women and they were admitted in that hospital with different prizes not in order for us to visit when they are doing.
And let me start by getting children.
Our nation's network.
Now it is not knowing that.
We are doing their bodies without going to see women.
Where we are supposed to be touched in Kinondoni as we are in the purpose of you.
We have seen that we are doing a little gift for all Tanzanians because of their parents.
Therefore, and his colleagues.
Why should give them the children in the short time, I have been able to gather them together and give them the education they are there.
From Dully Sykes and next year you will leave each other.
