Public servants be good.
The step by President John Magufuli to revoke the appointment of the former head of Shinyanga province, Anne Kilango has brought a lot of great debate.
Basically, there are those who protect themselves and share experiences on that step, but you must be said that they have discovered that there are servants who do work hard to fear, others do not be happy, things that will not be discussed in development.
For sure, the president was correct but the act has discovered that servants do not have cooperation, that is why we are getting confused and there is no need to help him so that he can be taken against them.
I think workers are supposed to work by following the slogan of here, professionalism, and not she had gone to hatred.
