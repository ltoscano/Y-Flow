Even in Mbeya Region, they are doing?
Mbozi district.
The request of things.
The district of Rungwe.
And when he visited that call it's with it in front of it was a lot, it will be careful when the farmers use different types of diseases that do not be able to prevent diseases and in the machine it depends with the ability of the farmer to go for him to get married.

If the price becomes good, you find the farmer can make those costs but the price is when it is below and meat is also little because it becomes difficult to the farmer.
What are our problems.
All needs.
