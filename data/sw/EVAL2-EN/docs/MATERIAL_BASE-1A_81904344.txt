I desire to own a news company like Citizen.
The editor, I am a youth who is looking at Kibiti Secondary School which is in a new district of Kibiti and Swahili (HGL), Navio has been shocked by the kind of your writing especially this newspaper between many.
I have a dream of coming to own a big company like this one after completing my studies and start a life process, I believe that when I get the opportunity that will enable us meet with other journalists, I believe I will learn a lot.
I think many who follow the news that you know your quality.
I agree with good work together with all the workers of the Citizen company.
