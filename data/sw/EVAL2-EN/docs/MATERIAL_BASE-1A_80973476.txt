The reporter Freddie Roosevelt was released into Pickup, on Clouds FM, Pesa is not every Kitavi.

Apart from that I am not a very listener to Clouds FM, since the era of Masoud Mwanazuo's nest in Mango Garden and Hando and I have been an listener to the Power Breakfast program.

Now, my problem is that a young man Ferouz Bano who did not openly say I was not happy and when he is in RFA, he was born with Clouds FM, it was not covered by Pambani County and even the listener can't know if she is found.

My advice to Clouds FM that you will not accept this season of Freddie, one person has the ability to play in a period but at the moment, I saw the Konongo and PRocky.
