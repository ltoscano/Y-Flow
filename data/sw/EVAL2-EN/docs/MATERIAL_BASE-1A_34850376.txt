Gambo has ordered water to be careful.

It has been written by Pamela McLendon in Arusha.

I was heard of 12th October, 2016.

The Provincial Commissioner of Arusha, Mrisho Gambo has directed the Director of Dar es Salaam Water Authority and Environment in Arusha City (Aubameyang), Ruth Bura, to make sure they face the water schedule from time at Sinoni location.

Moreover, he has appealed to urban planning experts to ensure that they provide education to the citizens so as to enable them to deal with the behavior of the haphazard selling of losses and sometimes to get a house to pave way for road expansion or the ways that are in various streets of that city.
Gambo said this yesterday after he was meeting with the problems of the citizens at Kibaoni Primary School located in Sinoni location, when he was inspecting development activities, including the construction project of Jambo Tanzania Limited up to Muriet together with the solar eclipse.
When he was the main market, Gambo received the complaints by those citizens, including lack of clean and safe water because the residents did not go around night due to wake up for the first time to see if the water came from.
