When we get in Dar es Salaam city, it is true that there is a fact that there is children who had been closed down inside the pesticide area.
And those children.
Give you a little in the community I wish you a lot for many reasons?
We were we supposed to see anything about the way at night.
The community that surrounds the area were supposed to know if children are making noise like someone who is using them because they wanted to know why there is an incident that is true, is to say what is still ongoing.
Because of that the full report of electricity was still underway.
The late God bless you, let us see you are politics of here and there is why that has been known as those who do not stay in the attack.
It is the children that come from being a country of Kenya, the rights of children are reported to up to the law of the child.
Which also gets a ton.
The United Nations has, I heard about the child who we have to talk to him is the one who is under the past years, where in Dar es Salaam, there will be ten o'clock and children are required to be careful.
Do not have hard work on how to end his age and which is okay, we see if we see if it is a matter to protect African child because he is being prepared as a female child.
He is supposed to be a mother and the community will not accept to say the answers of bringing about me in order for me is the responsibility of the father.
Wait and the public if you check the law of marriage it will tell me that the responsibility is the father's meaning.
For one reason or another he is unable to maybe the disease and he has got an accident, you cannot work, I give him the responsibility of caring for the family together.
