Children with a big news, Mgongo the open.
Shinyanga. 10 children among the 35 children with a big secret and back open have been operated on by the specialist doctors from the Orthopedic Institute (MOI) at the Provincial Referral Hospital in Shinyanga province.
The surgery service has taken place for three days in that hospital.
A team of specialist doctors in collaboration with GSM Foundation, have cautioned those children while 25 others are given normal treatment.
The leader of the graduates from the Muhimbili National Institute (MOI), Professor Josephat Kahwili, said that other children failed to operate on surgery because their problems have already been chronic.
"Many parents have been giving birth to children with a big problem and to bring faith in the stomach, but it's not true.
This problem is caused by such tests, it's treated with a sober mind.
Said Professor Ignas Rubaratuka.
The acting administrative secretary of Shinyanga province, Albert Msuha has congratulated that institution to provide free medical services to the residents of Shinyanga.
He said the problem has been seen to be big for many children because of their parents claiming to be unable to sustain their treatment costs.
Msuha has said that he will communicate with the ministry of health to look at the way to bring doctors from that treatment to help those children.
Some of the parents with those who underwent surgery, Anastazia Peter and Elizabert Robert, are thanking the citizens of giving the service to their children who were suffering from those diseases.
