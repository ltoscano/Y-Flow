Fastjet Tanzania has suspended its trips between Kilimanjaro and Nairobi.

Fastjet finished their journey from the Kilimanjaro International Airport to the International Airport, Jichunge.'
To end of the journey from that way results from existence of passengers in all two markets of Kilimanjaro and Nairobi, a situation that caused the lack of business benefits.
That organization has explained that its aim is to ensure that it gives the journey out of the first in Nairobi just just and when customers will need.
The journeys that were released from Dar es Salaam and Kilimanjaro go to Nairobi has started in January 11, 2016.
With the needs of the customer care for a long time, which at a big level is business between the areas, being held in Dar es Salaam and they have a huge number of people who are more than one million, so as to meet the big number of passengers.
In the second time, the moment is doing two trips to go and go back to the cities of this city, and therefore doing a total of its trips for a week between the International Airport in Dar es Salaam and the International Airport in Dar es Salaam and International Airport.
He said the new issue of the journey that gave them correct customer services early in the morning and the ones that were seen in the same period between those two cities and so as to give them a correct alternative for traveling for the fare they are facing.
He said the fare for Fastjet is basically the same as compared to other organizations, which currently has its journey between Kenya and Tanzania.
I also come from Tanzania to go into Tanzania to go through a fight against 107,800 dollars from leaving Kenya, and therefore Fastjet would enable passengers to get their tickets early before the day of starting to use that opportunity so that they can benefit from the low price.
