President Doctor John Magufuli has started working by preventing all the journeys outside the country for government officials, but those are important and for special reasons, which will have the blessings of his office.
In a environment of many challenges like to now in the country, the step of preventing those trips is very important because it will help reduce the use of government, a lot, in the eyes of many, they did not have a must.
The journeys outside the ministers and government officials have been facing many people an amount of looking for doubt like the benefits of the journey and the cost that the nation has been getting into their tuition fees.
The foreign journey managed to take place as it is only a system of lives of government officials to get a private income on the excuse of a working tour, in a loss of the country.
Our expectations is that, the cost of these trips shall be used in cost and quality of social services, which even after 54 years of freedom still there will be no reason for citizens as a result of the decision it will not be seen directly to the citizens.
When we increase the step, it is good to give a warning about the decision by the president because it has been a normal culture for every new president when he went into power to come up with instructions and instructions which takes great hopes to the citizens, but after time, things are going back to do his daily life.
According to the performance of President Doctor Magufuli, it is our hope that this step is not good and that it will continue to be the normal procedure for the government.
It is also good that the steps that arise from those actions will continue to be taken so as to eliminate non-governmental problems to the citizens, and now the place they see the lack of health and poor education that they are facing them.
