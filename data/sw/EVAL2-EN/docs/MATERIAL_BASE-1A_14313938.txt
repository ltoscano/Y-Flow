To be remembered by Lowassa, it is last of the journey, or at the beginning of God's journey?

The Kimanumanu members.

CC of CCM, has done its work, has shown his long distance name, Edward Ngoyai Lowassa!

There should be that which is the end of the journey of hope, or it is the beginning of the true journey of hope, for a long period of people, to officially start the journey of the entire Tanzanian president, by taking it officially to the grave?

The father of the nation, Mwalimu Nyerere, has ever said, the true opposition, will be given CCM because this is the period of this opposition?

For 50 years now, prevent you and learn of CCM and believe that CCM's candidate should not be the president of Tanzania!

There are Lowassa who defected to the grave, the name broke up by showing that its capability for not being dealt with and done to the goats, or the name Kocha, where I was coming out, but we did not get anything or anything but it is the anthill.

I am still a believer in plenty, it would not be a lesson so they cannot get a person, it will continue to make sure this one of CCM should decide our fate by our nation, or we should see our person and join them at the state of CCM?

I ask you again, this is the end of the journey, or the beginning of a true journey to lead CCM and serve them in Tanzania?

She does not mean!
