TCRA has warned that Channel Tena, by showing 'live' details by Asmara, Gwajima of allegations of Doctor Slaa.

I have heard of now through the Voice of America (the Swahili language), TCRA killed Channel Ten by showing 'live' details by Bishop Gwajima answering of incitement charges of Doctor Slaa.

This nation needs to work 'if it does not lie or not change again, because I see if changes will not be enough!

Tomorrow, it should be remembered that all the headlines, we have written the story of Gwajima again in the front time, you can ask ourselves what was announced 'live' but I was written but to be written by?

For sure change is a must this country.
