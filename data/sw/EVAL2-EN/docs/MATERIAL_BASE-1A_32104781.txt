While speaking in Dar es Salaam yesterday, the director of information of that institution, Asha Kigola said that the band was made up with the old legends of music with the economy of the coast.
He mentioned the musicians who make that group are the owners of the Ivory Coast group, Tarimba and Omar Tear, the veteran singer of Bongo Star, Mussa Yussuf and artists who have ever been the Jahazi Modern Taarab group, Rashid Yussuf, Babu Tale and Mohamed Maasai.
Asha said that the band under the Mkubwa and Wanawe Center is ready to camp for the purpose of preparations to provide the music entertainment.
He said those artists yesterday were expected to officially enter the studio for recording two songs of the band.
He said the expectation is the band to be a threat in the old music by giving a good message to the stakeholders of that music in the country and in East Africa as a whole.
"The introduction of this band will not expect to see great changes in that music to our musicians to give songs with a good message to the community especially stakeholders of Taarab music," he said.
