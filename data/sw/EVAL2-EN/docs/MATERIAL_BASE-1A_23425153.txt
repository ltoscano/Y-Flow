The boxing party in the Coastal Region (CRCC), is expected to give him his last year last week ready for the competition of this year.
Speaking to the nation today in Mombasa, the secretary of the schedule, Samson Mtoni has said that the schedule will be released next week just after the national stadium will be held.
"We are waiting for the national exams to be released officially, so that us should not be remembered," said Mtoni, who is also the coach of the Yellow Fm, Igunga District, Igunga.
Mtoni has said that the delay of the boxing title in Africa may have caused the delay of the national income.
Last year that party was given his back early though some of the competitions do not be followed due to lack of money.
