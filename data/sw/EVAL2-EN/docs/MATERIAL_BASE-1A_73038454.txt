Our National Assembly, I did not agree!
My dream of today from the bus is looking at things that are going on in Dodoma where it has the Parliament of the United Republic of Tanzania.
Despite being banned, they were banned, but there are many cases of supporting our law, they are seen in the streets.
That meeting of the budget of the budget which for now has three weeks, seems to be common, there are other things that took place many years ago or no new.
The debate of some of them has prepared itself on non-primary issues which have no benefit, to an extent that I asked himself maybe that is the big reason they decided to prevent the television to prevent it or there is another reason?
It is clear that the cause of the air in parliament is a big possibility of being removed or even to the presence of heavy things, an issue that is not allowed.
However, together with that, it seems that things in Dodoma, where this year we had hope that the mix up of many youths, the scholars and those who are used few changes, but by bad luck, these are those like the past, in short summary.
Our members of parliament have been seen in Dodoma for three weeks, we are being operated on, but they are continuing with their careless habit, but there are many other things that are for sure they are losing respect to the main platform for making laws.
