The minister of foreign affairs and East Africa cooperation, Ambassador Augustine Mahiga is in the country to lead President John Magufuli in leading the delegation of the local community development of South Africa (SADC) in the general elections of that country that will take place on September 8 and 10 this year.

According to information that was released by the director of the department of international cooperation in that ministry, that step came after Tanzania handed the position of chairmanship of leading political parties, defense, and security of SADC in the 36 meeting of the heads of state and government held in Mbilimnyi, Swaziland from August 29 to 31, this year.
That report explained that this responsibility of Tanzania in leading the Electoral Commission of the elections is due to the basis and guidelines of the democratic elections in the SADC region.
While in a bad state, Mahiga officially launched the commission that will have security from SADC countries on behalf of President Magufuli.
Moreover, Ambassador Mahiga got an opportunity to meet and have talks with the president of the islands, James DeBarge, and also doing talks with the minister of foreign affairs, Joel Nanauka and later meeting with the chairman of the National Electoral Commission on the islands.
