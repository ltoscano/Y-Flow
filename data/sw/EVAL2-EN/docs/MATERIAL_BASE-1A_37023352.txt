The day before yesterday I was surprised to get a lover of marijuana, what should I do?
I have a fianc√©e who asked me for my heart, but I was surprised when I was surprised by suddenly in his home the day before yesterday and used to buy marijuana since he was the first time, he had a lot of ideas and wanted to ask him.
What can I do? (SMS) is drugs, and someone who use it can be dangerous and it's good to know that you will have a good opportunity to investigate if it is his behavior or the reason that he gave you are true.
The husband do not know why my name does not know me, though I don't have any relationship outside and I have separated even in six months without coming back home and I have never been loved by us to protect us.
Through the SMS you know there's a problem if you are your husband, it seems that he is very worried about you listening to you together with any reason, try to understand the fear because they love her.
