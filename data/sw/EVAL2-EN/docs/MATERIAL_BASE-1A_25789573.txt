A tooth for a tooth 'a lady who does good is good and his new song today, Jokate Mwegelo,' Kidoti, "has wedded the album, Nasibu Abdul," Diamond Platnumz, who recently released his album, Nasibu Abdul, 'Diamond Platnumz', who recently made him close to the artist Ali Kiba '.

Speaking to the number one newspaper of Bongo stars, Friday Wenda, last weekend, Jokate said that he was surprised by those words that he had not allowed to recognize him because he is an issue of a person getting married, why is that he is wrong, then he is still getting married.

"Saso and Diamond's statement and I am very happy, I don't know what she has not found himself, I have not seen him that I was coming or I told him, more than the words of people in social media networks.

Even if the situation is still there, I don't see the meaning of the word that was not known since it is English and she gets married to Zari, (Zaidia Nuru Hassan) because she doesn't know her, "said Jokate seems to be treated with the statement of Diamond and added.

"It is possible that maybe the meaning of the word he will not recognize that, we said without looking for a long distance, therefore my order is to say that I don't have any reason to say so, maybe if he had other things different from that."
