Most of the Swahili sayings do not like to be very happy and see how many elders think they think of when they sell those sayings, you can't see if they see those sayings are used where there are many times that do not recognize its use.
After the occurrence of the sugar scandal, it was revealed that there are business people who follow the sugar and the government to deal with them and that I think these two events have no painful to the government because it seems to be evidence of the government in power against its citizens.
Politicians and these businessmen are people that know though each person has his area of doing his things, I will try to explain how these people get to be like.
As a business person is the citizens where in order for business to continue with its customers, but also in business people, but also in business people do not be able to do even if they get rid of the price so that they can get profit because they would have been done before.
I have been talking to my friend who has a shop that makes food in the period of the Sugar Board, it ordered that retailers in the sugar price of 1,800 villages, he told them that this political decision conducted by switching off the sugar costs for a total of 1,940 tons now is who would have agreed to sell the sugar at a guiding price?
At the moment the sugar industry from retailers have been increasing up to approximately 3,000 shillings and other areas up to 3,30000 shillings and continue to sell the sugar levels, therefore many businessmen have found themselves to each other against the citizens who are very happy with the increase in sugar prices.
