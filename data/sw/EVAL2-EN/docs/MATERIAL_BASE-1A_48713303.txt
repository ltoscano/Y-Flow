After TCRA switching off fake phones, traders have got a new phone market.

One of the news that was reported is this one from the Citizen newspaper, with the news reporter "fake phones will get in Mozambique, Congo."

The newspaper has been reported that two days after the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) bought fake phones, the traders of those phones have got the new market in Mozambique and Congo.

While speaking at different times with the newspaper, some of the youths who were found in the bus station to collect them, they said they had bought the transport to go to there because they sell them to the users, they said in those countries there are market because they have seized communication as usual.

That newspaper has quoted Lawrence Kyunga where they had bought it at a price of an agreement and went to sell them in the local market, a day before yesterday, but we have already started this business today, many days even though the shops were still unknown.
