Instead of our leaders be grateful for us to fully support for the benefit of the nation.

I am happy to see what happened in Lamu Island.
It is not the first time terrorism does not mean that this is led to the country.
There has been a series of events like this reason and that is why our leaders don't agree and change his thoughts and how our country will be safe.
Instead of each other and have been condemned each day it is happy to get more different types of politics along with them looking for a long time.
Politics will not help with ordinary citizens to continue suffering from this country, it has many challenges that need to be solved quickly.
The economic situation is bad, the security is it has dropped, tribalism and disadvantages of seeing a lot of conflicts in the community.
The government is expected to take appropriate measures against attacks from time to time.
Like those who have been given the responsibility of ensuring our Kenya is safe then they should be transferred to others to take their place.
The meetings and all those unions have not been able to do issues like this and not issues of such a union will be run.
