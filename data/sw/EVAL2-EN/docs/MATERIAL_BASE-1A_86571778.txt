Yanga plays for Simba's victory.

Yanga yesterday have given a letter to the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) to oppose the victory of Simba that they got against them last Sunday wanted to join the contest for three points and if TFF will be unable to do that then they have put open their intention to take the issue to the Federation of International Football Association (FIFA), to look for their rights.

The biggest thing that made Yanga to reach that decision and wants Simba to get those points after Simba went to have their player Ibrahim Ajib, with three yellow cards.

Previously before that game, Yanga sent a letter to TFF to know which the regulations is forcing the player with three cards to choose the match to play while he continued with another, but they decided to write other results from yesterday that resulted from another declaration of Simba getting in three points.

Yanga's secretary general, Doctor Jonas Tiboroha, explained that if they won the game, they could be forced Simba to be fined but because it should be stopped, then it is supposed to join the contest for three points where he insisted that in that he will not turn back until they can get their appropriate rights.

"We have written the letter today (yesterday) earlier today and already we have already taken the TFF about wanting Simba denied the points that she got into our Sunday game because they defeated Ibrahim Ajib, with three yellow cards, something that is contrary to the soccer regulations how he wants.

"And if you will look for TFF you will miss the appropriate answer to carry or fail, the case, then we will get a solution then we will arrive up to FIFA, not to make sure our rights are available.

"If it could have been the same day, then Simba must have been fined but because they have won three points, even their match they played with Stand United and Prisons will also involve points since they went against the regulations like this.

"Something to ask you are that regulations can be changed without the concerned parties which are the league teams to have information but Simba alone.
