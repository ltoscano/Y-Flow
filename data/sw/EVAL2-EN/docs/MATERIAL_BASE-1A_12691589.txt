The Party of Democracy and Development (CHADEMA) has said that it intends to go to the High Court to ask for the police force to take place in different stations for more than two weeks without being given a bond of the police or arraigned in court.

That statement was issued by the attorney general of the party Tundu Lissu when he was speaking to journalists at the party's headquarters in Mwashiku Ward, Kinondoni District where he said that they are being held by involvement in the activities of the wall and other political issues.
He said the High Court has the authority of removing any non-governmental authority that involves a person to take him to court because the youths have been set free at the University of Dar es Salaam as Ben Addoh Mapunda, Igurubi County, Shakira Abdallah Makame, Doctor Elias Kiyoja, Juma Salum Saidi.
"If you go to Tuesday, they have not been taken to court or they have not been given a bond of police, we will go to the High Court to use their authority (DCI), RPC of RPC or heads of stations that are set free, do not know why they are holding more than two weeks," said Lissu.
Lissu said that they have already started preparations for organizing those documents which will be channeled in the High Court so as to make one of the leaders.
He said they will use the article number 390 of the criminal offenses act which carries the high court to give an order and direct it that someone has not been taken against the law, to be taken to court or it was given free.
This newspaper looked for the commander of the special unit of Dar es Salaam, Commissioner Simon Sirro to know the truth about the accusations of those people to be held, but his mobile phone called without being received.
