JK visits students who are inspiring.

A cookie has risen up to the village of Trambalu High School, after a total of eight student students who were defeated in the water project on Saturday evening.
The villagers bought tickets to look for Jesse Simiyu and Brian Simiyu, all of 16 years, following the reception area and their fellow students that they were seen the last time dancing after leaving in school.
"They were seven students, and it is said that one of them was looking at the help where one person who went to help him or while their colleagues were forced to leave," said Mzee Nicholas Kay, who is a grandfather's friend of the deceased.
It took a period of approximately two hours to the two people to get out of those two while the villagers who were in that place were shocked.
The head teacher of AGAPE, Mister Philip Magupa, said that the two were ditalists, last Friday when he completed the strategies of accidents in Ihenga town, "it will have died though we came back to their homes," he said.
