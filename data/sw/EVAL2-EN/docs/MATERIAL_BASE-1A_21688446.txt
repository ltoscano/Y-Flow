The court of diseases have never been able to do justice in cases of marriage conflicts, unfortunately, women and children about the conflicts that comes out in family and affecting the children themselves so as to get a report.
And the government's house and I am known here in business.
The child was found.
He said.
Likewise, the women have been asked to have broken the heart and your decisions, we saw the first courts, to make sure that it is good to protect the high court by getting an appeal because it is the only way to achieve their mind.
That call has been made by Miss Jonesia Rukyaa gave a short time after losing his case in the court of appeal against her husband.
Smile has said that those players were vying for the right to build their two children after the broke down of their marriage.
He is honored.
I have not seen me, I have not got the brain of looking at it to know where he is in which state but I was still doing a big challenge to them.
Why do my password, I was able to have the ability.
You will do you.
Reading the judgment ahead of both sides.
The referral hospital, David Moyes has said in accordance with the law and procedures of the disabled children under the age of seven, they are required to go up with the mother and after losing the age when I was asked and elect one person they want to live.
Previously the District Hospital located in Mwanakwerekwe C, listening to that case and gave a three year old child to be handed over to his father and child's daughter Moh'd who is only one year of her mother who were beaten and every side and decided to appeal.
Like that appeal has given out seven days to the father's father to bring back the child to see him.
The one who wanted the children to hand over the birth certificate to her father and allow me to see her children at any time, but he will not use a country without an agreement between the two sides.
James.
