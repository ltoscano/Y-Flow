The witch doctor between pastoralists, KFs.
The conflict is expected to be between hundreds of farmers and the Forest Service Agency (KFS) after a period of the notice given to the owners of livestock in possession of Eliona.
That election that was given two months ago by KFS, ended on Sunday and which will be the implementation of the directive that causes a big forest with Eastleigh neighborhood, and Kapagigi.
Farmers who are not registering their animals so as to be allowed to go into the forest that has been set aside in that area then they get involved have been stopped.
This step will be sent to KFS guards in the forest that will be followed up to relocate the livestock without stopping.
The head of conservation in KFS, that area Solomon Miy, said they will not increase the period of notice for farmers to register livestock, saying they were given enough time.
