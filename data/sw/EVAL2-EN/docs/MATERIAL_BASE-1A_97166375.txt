He said that the plan that is currently right is EWURA to start the verification of certificates that will be presented to the customers who are going to ask for licenses and because someone who is found using fake certificates will not be handed over to the media stations.
He has urged the contractors to ensure all technicians who use them to their companies to be involved with the reputation of the technical license, instead of using the 'tusks' which are caused by technicians who are capable of lack of employment.
