Ras Makunja has decided to work with my work now.
The late God will go up because he has already left is heading to my home, I'm in the way God bless you, I am pleased to do at work, I am supposed to work early so that we can also leave early, so that we can also leave early.
When we get in Dar es Salaam, I will be a friend and I've not left me.
We are partnering with two one hundred thousand in that, he does not complete the death of God, she does not finish his work.
The scholars is when I end up, let me end up, let me end up, it's when you end up, that is when it's heading to home, and when they go to Dar es Salaam.
