This issue of sugar should not depend on the government should not want to use more.
An editor, to now the sugar of my neighborhood has bought at 3,000 shillings, I have heard that they buy at a price of 4000 shillings especially in the regions of the outskirts of the country.
It has not been about the products that may increase the price in a short period as it was in sugar.
The government announced to intervene in between I believe that the cost of Tanzania but now has changed to be severe pain than usual.
For a long time the price of sugar was 2000 shillings in the area I went to live, I expected that the government will happen between 1,700, but it's not otherwise.
I believe that the government will have learned anything and it will not turn back again to take the decision without doing research.
The executives do their work hard to avoid conflicts in important issues like this.
Why is it true that the sugar issue is supposed to assure citizens of the income of what?
A Tanzanian that lives in a box of one million to sell for 75 percent of sugar, 3,000 shillings is what happened.
Quick action should be taken to control this matter.
