I was released, 15th October, 2016.

Approximately two weeks now the music artist of new generation, Rehema Chalamila.
"Ray C" has been thanking his fans for continuing giving her the heart that she gets to get out in a disaster of drug abuse.

"
It is clear that if a person who was reliable in his family did not end to be a client of drug trafficking.
This disaster of drugs is a culture which is in high speed here in the country, with artists, especially youths with the leaders of using those drugs.
In the previous years, we heard the American and European artists being linked to the use of drugs, the international artists were self-success, but the drugs were shocked and they lost completely in the world of entertainment.
On the side of our artists, there is no one who doesn't know the effects of drug abuse, but the energy that pushed them to get there is big and others believe that they are using those drugs that have had the ability to perform on stage for a long time without getting tired and also identifying shame.
Unfortunately, these drugs are sold and are used by holding back because the effects are seen and I am happy to hear Ray C has a great intention to oppose all the use of drugs to the youth and urged Tanzanians to join them to oppose this disaster.
Its the expectations of Ray C will be a great help to artists and other youths who have died in the disaster, scientists, because when you fell and move forward and succeed again, it is that their work has a great value, therefore they get married.
They should know that getting married on the use of those drugs causes pain to fans, it's not expected that their families face, because there is no need for the wealth of the youth that are selling those drugs while others are spoiling their lives while the nation is still need.
