The government has said that it will not tolerate new citizens living in the refugee camp of Ulyankulu and that it will attract the permits for citizenship to also go against the regulations and procedures of the country.

That statement was issued yesterday by the Minister of Internal Affairs, Mwigulu Nchemba, after receiving the report of the government of Tabora province to speak about the behavior of some of the new citizens.
While presenting the report of the province in front of the minister, the head of Tabora Province, Aggrey Mwanry, he wanted the government to see the importance of transferred new citizens living in Ulyankulu instead of them to live in.
Responding to the request, Nchemba said a new citizen of Tanzania who have been registered and got a permit to go against the requirements of the country's laws and its permits will be stopped and will be forced to return to them.
He said 977,886 students have been so much and agreed to live with refugees like their brothers, but they are currently participating in part of giving the services such as water and even in the service.
He said that this is not the end of receiving those refugees, where they are supposed to remain like the camps.
He added that those who failed to be given citizenship will be given to citizens who will be given to the areas of living with the government and not knowing.
He explained that the areas where the refugees from Burundi of Ulyankulu in the district, have been approved by the park, who receive citizenship are required to stop the reserve as it is.
