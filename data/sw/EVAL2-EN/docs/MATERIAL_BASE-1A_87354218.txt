The government in Kigoma province has denied the reports that are being spread on social media in the country to occur in accidents due to the plane of Air Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL) at Kigoma Airport.

The District Commissioner of Kigoma, Samson Majwala speaking in Kigoma yesterday said there isn't any plane that fell in Kigoma town or any part of the province in recent days.
In addition, he said in being satisfied with that, visited Kigoma Airport, to see the real situation and that he has satisfied themselves and thought that the reports are being spread because it is a hole.
That head of the district said that he was communicating with FIFA leadership which has given to the government that two new planes which have been bought by the government are at the Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam being safe, even a plane that shows Ah-8, is safe and is doing its journey as usual.
"That is a result of wanting our government and our organization, to see that our government has done a decision not to buy two planes, the truth is a rumor and are supposed to understand," said the district commissioner.
In addition to that, he asked ATCL to give a report of removing that rumor, but he also requested the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) to investigate that rumor and take a stern action that brought the rumors with an intention of launching it.
