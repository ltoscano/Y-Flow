Dar es Salaam, the veteran striker of Simba, Musa Hassan Abbasi, has said he wants to continue playing for that team next season despite being a player who is able to play anywhere.
Speaking to this newspaper the day before yesterday after the league game against Azam FC, Jangalu said that together with that he is a player who is able to serve his team or that he likes to continue to serve the people of Msimbazi next season.
"Together with that I am a player who was able to play anywhere, I would like to play for Simba next season, I would like to play for Simba in the next season," said the star who has not received any goal this season to make it their opponents and that the important part is to end the safe league for the remaining games.
"If you look for our chance, it's a limited form, it's only 50 percent for now but anything that can arise in the ball, let me see me," he said.
"I ask my players to be one thing and we continue to measure Simba, by recognizing the value and our responsibility to ensure we are getting to our team."
Jangalu added that leadership should not be able to sit and prepare so as to ensure Simba is doing well in the next season.
