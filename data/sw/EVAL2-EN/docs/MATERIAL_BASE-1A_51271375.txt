Stakeholders in the Coastal region have not given their contribution to the committee that has been buried the responsibility of receiving recommendations at the Manufacturing Company and property.
That donation that gives direction on how to be able to distribute revenue generated from resources and resources like other property in the country, up to now it has not been a result of the stakeholders, especially from the Coastal region, which caused the effects of minerals.
The executive director of the organization of non-communicable diseases, Mister Yusuf Lowoko, said all stakeholders wants to contribute to the project so as to ensure that every party is involved with natural property.
Mister Musomba said if they become the committee that collect the opinion was a public meeting last month so as to receive recommendations about the project, more contribution of the involved is still needed.
"We know that while it is important to complete this issue because of development, but getting great contribution to the economy and the development of our country," he said.
He added that it is known as the Mumask Investment of 2014, which was prepared by the National Parliament and now it is waiting for constitutional changes and therefore there is need of collecting revenue from minerals and therefore there is need to collect revenue from minerals which are the concerned parties in that sector.
He said even though the process is supposed to be read for the second time in the next few weeks, it is important to be identified as a bad availability of benefits resulting from minerals and resources that other property will be the main cause of conflicts.
