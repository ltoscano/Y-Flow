The gospel musician in the country who has already been called by the Revolutionary Party (CCM) to vie for the parliamentary seat in special seats, Irene Uwoya, and his fellow artists who did not support the party while some of them were very close to President Jakaya Kikwete who is completing his term.

Through its social network of Instagram, Uwoya has told artists who have been saying together with the reason of supporting him when he have never been read even one day.

"Now I will go back to the ones that do not know! In our industry, the plain truth is that he has been very close to the artists and it makes us benefit.

"But there is no wonder many people do not know his contribution, actually it is very much!

"There are people who were involved in the State House, it will help them so much in their work but today they have forgotten all of them and support someone who has never been even so much, whether you are still there!
