Anything that they played is Mbowe and Lowassa could not be paid?
Martti Ahtisari Center, 2015.

The Party for Democracy and Development (CHADEMA) has put his fate in his status, and all its reputation in the hands of the former prime minister, Edward Lowassa by taking it as a few months ago, that you will allow Lowassa just a few months ago, that will enable Lowassa to wait for him.
The arrival of Lowassa's arrival has been received to some people if it is the gold opportunity for the opposition to unite with the Revolutionary Party (CCM) in power, this is the only great reason for the presidential candidate, Freeman Mbowe said all those who have met any other candidate will be enough and therefore CCM will fall down.
This is a very big margin of political parties which has been played with these politicians and the truth if they have forgotten that party, if you will enable them to play their positions within a party and even if they will make them get their positions within the party just after the results announced that you will allow CCM and its partners to move forward.
It is good to think that two major things will also be seen since when Lowassa will be seen, but if he will be able to bring victory, especially if he will be able to bring him a great capital, it will be seen well during the campaign and during the election results.
If you remember it is heading to all big leaders who want to welcome the Lowassa's campaigns to be held up by CCM, Honorable Mbowe, Lissu, Mnyika and other presidential campaigns will be left to other leaders and without doubt, the parliamentary leadership will have to be ready to pay.
But there is another thing that needs to be careful so much by his results, by seeing Lowassa being the only candidate that will enable him to pray for him because they believe that CCM is very much and why they believe CCM is very happy to ask him to vie for him.
Such as it is, Lowassa's money that will enable his national leadership can get very much - if they play or them, they will be unable to break their decision and others if you will be unable to bring back their decision and those who have refused to bring him two times, and those who have resigned so as to give an opportunity to others.
