I was heard of 12 September 2016.

The active defender of Simba Mohamed Hussein 'Tshabalala' has been rewarded with a Toyota Raum car and the chairman of the committee registration of Simba, Zakari Hans Pope as part of recognizing the efforts and contribution to the team.

Hussein has been awarded that vehicle today in the office of Hans Pope, Mbezi Ward, Dar es Salaam in hand with the amount of 1 million shillings for six months.
While handing over the vehicle yesterday, Hans Pope said that the gift did not have an agreement with that player that will end at the end of this season.
"The efforts of this player at the moment have made a car to the vehicle as part of supporting him and congratulating them for doing good work and help the team to be in a better level," he said.
He said the gift is as usual and that even to others who have shown good standards will follow the footsteps, the player joined Simba since last season from Kagera Sugar and he has been involved in contributing a lot of goals by goals and also to be elected as the best player of that club in October last year.
In the last game against Mtibwa Sugar that was played at the Uhuru Stadium, Hussein gave a goal scored by Ibrahim Ajib, where Simba emerged with a win of 2-0 goals.
