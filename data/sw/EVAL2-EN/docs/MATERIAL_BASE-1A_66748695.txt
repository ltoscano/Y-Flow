Why in UKAWA, they have decided to be their presidential candidate?

Edward Lowassa has joined CHADEMA and he will be the presidential candidate of CHADEMA and CCM of UKAWA. Lowassa is the president of the Democratic Republic of UKAWA.

And he has been so for a long time to us CHADEMA, he has put it in a list of corruption due to its involvement in the oil scandal in the year 2007.

Therefore, a good question that we must give you with fluency, this is why we have agreed, not just to receive as a member, but to give him the honor to be our presidential candidate.

And because our participants of UKAWA which have agreed to be their presidential candidate?

For the first time, we see CCM being beaten in the middle and a person who plays for CCM and the ruling party is Edward Lowassa as CHADEMA have done a great job to build the party since 2010.
We have a lot of candidates and good candidates in many regions of elections and the council of councilors than we have ever been with them for all the past years, even so, it is also true that there are many areas of the country, where we are so bad.

By getting back to CHADEMA and UKAWA, Lowassa the one that brought in those areas at the political party and very disturbing when they go to save.

And Lowassa will go back to CCM because he has great strength inside the party than any other politician in the current environment, we need to decide who is the biggest thing of our country and its welfare, Mrs Edward Lowassa accused of corruption or CCM and the ruling system that is building the environment that deals with protecting the corruption.

We will decide the parliament of UKAWA which we decided to be our great importance for now and all the days is CCM and the ruling system.

We have welcomed Edward Lowassa because it was not disappointed with CCM and the ruling party, we request the citizens to understand us and to join them.
