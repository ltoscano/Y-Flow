That incident took place last month in that hospital after Asha-Kwizera (left) and doctors and nurses to put a dirty language, without only the reason for doing that.
The senior health officer of Amana Bank, Doctor Egid Mubofu has said yesterday that the servants who did not mention them have been taken to the council of servants and doctors of the hospital for more investigation.
"What happened this day they were arrested with those servants to go to the mother who gave birth, who was also small.
"We are doctors and we are saying that we have disciplinary procedures, we are talking after the servants should be known for mistakes, the first step is that we wait and another when the investigation continues against them," said Doctor Shangani.
Doctor Shanghai, who is also the chairperson of the Association of doctors in Tanzania (EAGI), said what required it is a good language because it is a must for any patient when he was going to hospital, so as to find out of various diseases.
When that is emanating from Amana Bank of Tanzania (bulb) has urged the community to continue raising events of violence and bad services that will be done by midwives during giving birth, so that the relevant agencies can see the problem with its size and work on them.
