The council of sponsorship of the Civic United Front (CUF) has said it makes a procedure to bring together two sides of the leadership of that party with the aim of finishing the crisis.

For several days now the CUF party has been in a political conflict between the secretary general of that party, Maalim Seif Sharif Hamad and his chairman who got the resignation and back to Professor Ibrahim Lipumba.
While speaking to journalists in Dar es Salaam city after the council of sponsors are meeting, the chairman of that council and a member of that council, Peter Malebo said that the conflict that is inside that party will be resolved within the party after serving us with the two sides.
"The problem that is in CUF is a long-term problem with members of the board of that party, that is the responsibility of finishing the conflict, but there are some members who have been doing the conflict and grow the conflict instead of understanding," said Mwaya.
