The Minister of Works Transport and Communication Professor Makame Mbarawa has urged the Tanzania Telecommunication Company Limited (TTCL) to look for customers to save their records at the National Housing Corporation, located in Dar es Salaam city so that their information should be safe.

Furthermore, he has instructed the director of marketing of the company to be the founder and start to follow the customers he has and not waiting for the customers to follow his office.
Professor Mbarawa made that order when he made a surprise visit to that building in Kijitonyama, where he explained the importance of doing quick efforts to look for customers with an aim of increasing the income of the nation.
He said that station has been tested for security because it has been joined by the National Communications Regulatory Authority, thus the customers will take their information at a high level.
In addition, he ordered all the issues concerning the business agreement in that center, to follow up in a short way so as to put appropriate measures and follow keenly.
The acting director of information and communication technology (ICT) of the ministry of construction, transport, and communication (communication sector), Peter Mwasobwa said Minister Mbarawa to implement all that he urged them to be done so as to improve service in the center.
In another step, Professor Mbarawa has met a business representative from the England Embassy in charge of Tanzania and Kenya, that has ordered them to discuss various issues of improving infrastructure in the country.
