The involved in this exercise.
In Dodoma it is not fear of fear saying or it's not a representative to see any worker that seen in the level of servants of the department of information?
Like it is therefore, let me listen to me that when journalists get tired, let me start a matter like it is to be amended.
It is that, there are a lot of inspection in the doors of entering the parliament grounds and the one to intervene in the hall where its aim is to be good to the security of members of parliament, servants, journalists and visitors.
Here is supposed to satisfy itself that, all the inspection that are done in journalists have put their equipment in the bags, but this was the first to intervene in the hall who is forced to remove it from a bag belonging to the computer.
The intention is good, but this issue that makes a doubt to the security of the press and especially considering that they know their fellow writer Sharon Sputanza decided to pay the system and his computer to be demolished, but no one was forced to pay.
It's not a good reason for the concerned parties is that, the machine was removed and because everyone likes to be safe, but because his inspection should be different from the others that were scored a few meters from there?
