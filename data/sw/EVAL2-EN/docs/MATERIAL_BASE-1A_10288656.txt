The government in Mbeya province has blamed the plan of the District Council of Chunya District and all the farmers who have benefited from different issues including geothermal energy and taking them to the areas that were set aside for their purpose.

Mbeya Regional Commissioner, Amos Makalla made those statements yesterday when he made a meeting with officials of the ward and villages of Chunya District.
Makalla said that the government's stand is to see all the natural fertility is used so as to enable environmental protection and by preventing the destruction of any kind including poultry farming.
He urged the officials of the ward and villages to ensure they are participating as required by supporting farmers who are in areas that are allowed and not to be afraid of politicians who want to stop the plans like that.
"There are some of your cows that have never seen, if you don't know, when he was living in there, he did not hesitate to hear those this journey and we do not want to hear the operation, but our first customer should not tolerate," he insisted.
He also warned that the behavior of some of the farmers who just after going out in special areas that they set aside from their brothers and start bringing groups of livestock coughing, saying that behavior has been taken because areas have been set due to livestock that are currently underway.
The District Commissioner of Chunya District, Rehema Madusa said that the operation of all farmers in a bad state of forests will start at any time after the completion of the destruction of livestock and they have been set aside in the areas that were set aside.
