Kenya has set history at the end of last week by burned more than 100 tons of elephants together with more than one hundred tons of elephants which were arrested from people that are accused of having poachers of this time and it has been doing a fire cargo of elephants immediately after time.
The step of Kenya gets publicly over the elephants' teeth that have been arrested by poachers in the month of July, when the president of Kenya at the same time when he found 12 tons of elephants' teeth that were supposed to be released by poachers.
In these events, Kenya succeeded to put an example to be followed in the world because many other nations have already received that example and it burnt down the elephants' teeth that were arrested from poachers which were in their park.
But other countries taking that example in Kenya, there have been very difficult work to convince Tanzania to stop the elephants' teeth which is believed that Tanzania gets more than 90 tons of elephants' tusks worth 90 tons, due to various reasons such as age or old.
This step by Kenya uses elephants' tusks after time has enabled the changes in several policies including those of climate, in relation to issues of controlling the crime and the changes took place after it was revealed that crime has never been discovered to be dangerous for the environment and lives of people and other creatures.
That is why the international organization for fighting business of those creatures are in danger of their disappearance, as from Kenya since it is believed that it helps in reducing land acts in the world because it is believed that it helps in reducing land acts in the world because it is believed that it helps in reducing the sale of elephants' tusks in the world.
But the policy on the other side, has been a pillar for growth of crimes and this is because the business of the elephants' tusks currently is done by smuggling and it is known that any business that is taking place at a high price, then its products is sold at a high price while that activity is causing many passengers because of that activity now it gives more income.
And with a confirmation of elephants' teeth alone, it does not be able to help reduce the problem of crimes and research shows that despite the sale of elephants' teeth that were banned in the world, but the acts of crimes are caused by the number of elephants especially in the African Continent.
That situation has made an increase in blood to enable Tanzania to burn bags of elephants' tusks which are in its park, many want to promote Kenya and burn those drugs as a way of fighting corruption.
