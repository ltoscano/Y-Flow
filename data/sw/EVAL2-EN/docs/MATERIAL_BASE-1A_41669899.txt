Morogoro Provincial Commissioner Doctor Stephen Kebwe has urged the leadership of Kilosa district council to stop the intention of testing for residential houses in the area of 7,200 acres that were donated by citizens in the district with an investor in Africa for agricultural activities.

The investor has reduced 200 million shillings from a large area of its farm for the purpose of residents of the villages that sell their farms so that they can promote agricultural activities of various crops, being a step to reduce the shortage of land areas in agriculture.
The action of the end of those acres was arrived after talks between the district government, councils, citizens and the investor.
However, he said before that issue has not yet been taken to the law, the district council has prepared a decision to test for plots, something that will go against the aim of removing the water problem for the citizens of Kilosa.
Therefore, he urged land experts and other directors to return that issue at the councilors meetings so as to be able to strengthen the intention of testing for plots and instead of those acres will be discussed in production of various crops as intended.
"The council is supposed to look for another area for testing the fields, this event has been released by the investor for the purpose of agricultural activities for citizens, let it as is, because they can cause another conflict between the farms," said Doctor Kebwe.
Together with that, he ordered the government authorities of that district to review their farms not to be taken so that action can be taken.
One of the leaders of the African Union of Muzidalifa Shekh Abdalla Karoli has said that the drawings of the new map of the farm has been taken to the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development and is being implemented in the final stages.
