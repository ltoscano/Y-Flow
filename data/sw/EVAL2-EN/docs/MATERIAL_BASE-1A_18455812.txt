The government has thanked the efforts of the stakeholders of film industry in the country because of the efforts in ensuring that industry can bring sustainable development including reliable employment to the youth.

Those congratulations have been issued by the executive secretary of the film board in Tanzania (KBN) Joyce Fissoo when he met with a delegation from non-governmental institutions of Tetemesha Entertainment, when they visited him at his office yesterday to officially launching the project of Tetemesha Entertainment.
Fissoo said that the project is important in the future of growing the film industry in the country because it is expected to reach many stakeholders of that industry who are in the provinces of the outskirts.
"I say I am very happy and I commend so much for your creativity, this project is good and it will increase productivity in our film industry, and I promised to give them cooperation when you leave you," said Fissoo.
Moreover, he gave advice to the institution to use the film exhibition in the country in different areas in the country so as to implement that project because the government's intention is to see the concept of getting rid of artists' work.
According to the Executive Director of Tetemesha Entertainment, John Kallaghe said that together with that project it's private but due to the great faith that the film board have found guilty of continuing implementing a big issue like this without involving those authorities, which is the chief supervisor of the film industry in the country.
