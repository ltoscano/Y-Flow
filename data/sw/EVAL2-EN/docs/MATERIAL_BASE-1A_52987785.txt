Statements by leaders pay him.
By Bashir Yakub.
The statements we want to meet between the government and the opposition party of the opposition are continuing to promote our country's reputation and it needs dangerous immediately and at any cost led.
Currently, whoever did you know about the truth that they have been involved with the investor especially after the leader of many people in parliament, Aden Hazard, said that the members of the attempt failed to see me the leader is that every opposition party has had a habit of giving statements to protest instead of building.
The habit of dealing with the government in every time they are working for citizens without looking for alternative ways of implementing the requirements of the citizens and the nation is the one that made Mister Djinnit soon after the leader told those statements like the leader of the opposition to prepare themselves popularity through the forthcoming general elections of 2017.
Many Kenyans are heading to agree with the ones with those thoughts and it will be difficult to listen.
Probably, there are several leaders of the opposition who have never been impressed by the administration of President Uhuru Kenyatta, since he was sworn in to lead this country, these are supposed to end night and in the afternoon to ensure that his government has reduced, so as to stop their hearts.
Those are the same as they meet, not knowing if this country is safe or not, what would I want to see our economy being safe or not in our country, why should I think you will be supported by some of the citizens who know many about the killing being implemented by these criminals, but can't inform us.
The reason and meaning is that they want the government it is not clear that it has not been able to control crime in this country, but the constitution did not allow the freedom to give their opinions, but the constitution did not allow the freedom to give their views, but we know that we should know what we need to say.
