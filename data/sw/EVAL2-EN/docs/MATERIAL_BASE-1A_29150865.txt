Our problem we are urging leaders to?
I have decided to write a few words for us we said we are hurt by our Simba and Yanga soccer club, we have been very good people to support these teams, but we think that we have decided to bring development in the club.
We have been good fans so much in this, we have been good fans for someone who does not have the ball, but we want to receive a distance and vote.
You will not heard, when he wanted my votes, let my colleague, now I asked himself, this is why these want to see development or the candidate will give them?
It's surprising that these people who call the members tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, they have started a chance to be a leader and the development leader, what does it get to development when you want someone to be?
At the time of doing a huge decision, the ones involved think more than deciding to choose the fanaticism and those involved concerned to be a bomb.
Simba and Yanga are a big club, we are supposed to investment like Azam, but every day they destroy the leaders with the promise of investment, but where there's no something.
Jamal Mnyamwezi has resigned.
