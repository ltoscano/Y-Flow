(TANESCO).

The Deputy Minister of Energy and Minerals, Doctor Medard Kalemani, said that when he was on a tour to inspect the implementation of the rural electrification projects in Babati district and Mbulu in Manyara province.
"Some of these contractors who have electricity have been causing huge costs of giving that service, its results do the citizens to be connected to the electricity services," he said.
He said some of the contractors have been doing that job under standards and causing various problems to the citizens including houses to get water problems and insisted that anyone who will make that directive will be taken against them.
At the same time, Doctor Kalemani has ordered the directors of TANESCO to provide education to citizens about the benefits of using a device that is known as Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (electricity) which takes electricity within a house without a customer being forced to get into the cost of getting electricity prices within the house.
"This device is 39,500 and can be used in one house to five houses, therefore, TANESCO is supposed to provide education to citizens so as to use this device," he said.
He said the use of electricity in that province is under eight megawatts while the capacity of the machines were 40 megawatts, thus urged the executives in that province to encourage various investors who are going to invest in the province to increase the use of electricity.
