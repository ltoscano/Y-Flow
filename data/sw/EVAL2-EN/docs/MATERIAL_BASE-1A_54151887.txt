All of them make sure there is a huge number of cancer diseases and said to kill a large number of people, it is good for all women in the country to come out to check the health especially the disease so as to have found the problem to be given treatment early.
It is good to come out in the campaign like those that are run for free or even to arrive at the government hospitals to those who are very big so that they can be able to go for those tests, including taking action when you see various changes.
For there are women who are able to see signs which are not normal in our country but they are not silent until they see the situation is dangerous to the health thus it is good to come out early to test and know the problem.
It is clear that there is no woman for these times it is able to ensure that lack of this disease due to the system of life living in our country especially drinking alcohol and others.
Therefore, it is good for every time to its time together with using women's groups to increase their income to plan the leadership of various hospitals like the Ocean Road or Muhimbili to enable cancer to get an opportunity to test their health and get treatment early.
