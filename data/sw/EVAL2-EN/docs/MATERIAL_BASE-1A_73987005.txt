The Union of the Citizens Constitution (Ukawa) has said that they did not turn up or don't return to the union, the former chairman of the Civic United Front (CUF), Professor Ibrahim Lipumba who was admitted to that position, then serving the position and returned to the registrar of political parties, Judge Francis Mutungi.

In addition, they have said that they do not depend on the behaviors but they will continue to strengthen the strength of their union.
That has been said by the chairman of Ukawa, Freeman Mbowe yesterday when he was giving a statement to the journalists about the political conflict that is going on at the CUF.
Mbowe said because the union was supporting CUF, they recognize Julius Mtatiro as the chairman and Maalim Seif Sharif Hamad as the secretary general, therefore they will continue to work with them.
He said as a result of that conflict inside CUF, they are requesting their party members, leaders to be elected and representatives to continue cooperating with that goal that created Ukawa.
At the same time, our reporter, Lucas Raphael writing from Tabora, says the leaders, members and lovers of the Civic United Front (CUF) in Tabora province have done a special ceremony of encouraging two goats and eating carbohydrates at their office, Professor Ignas Rubaratuka.
During the ceremony, the chairman of CUF, Tabora district, Milulu (middle), gave an official statement on behalf of his fellow leaders, members and lovers of that party to recognize Professor Lipumba be the legal chairperson of the party in line with all leaders that were sacked including the member of parliament of the Kaliua Constituency, Magdalena Sakaya.
