For sure some of being raped and children in the community have increased in speed, especially in school, due to statistics to show that primary and Tumaini schools in Ilala district, Dar es Salaam, are leading in actions of some being raped.

The Chief Social Welfare Officer of Ilala Municipality, Minister Nasir said the evaluation was done since January to June this year, it revealed that those schools and three others have received those problems.
Other schools include Tabata Primary School, Magoza village which is at Kinyerezi and primary school, giving birth to those acts themselves by themselves, a situation that caused other students to get into that process.
It has been revealed that between 10 children, four female children were raped and brothers, relatives and their fellow students, while four female children were raped and may have their brothers or guardians.
For these statistics, it shows that there is a big problem and for starting from the family and later children to go each other in school, therefore the control is required to start home for women to try to prevent many children as well as brothers and relatives.
It's not that it is using the male brother but everyone has its behavior, therefore it is difficult to know who is good and to know that it is good to speak to our children every time.
Well, it is also open for children and be close to them so as to educate and give them the knowledge of the advertise the school for a long time they live.
Well, women to reduce and live with love and let them close to children so that they can be free and explain how many things like the way to reduce that problem.
Similarly, for children who have been operated on thus it is good for women to help them by making sure that they were taken by providing cooperation with the concerned authorities and even if they believe that action is a husband, brother or your brothers close to them, take action so as to end that dirty behavior.
To continue to protect these people, it is a reason for the spread of those acts that are ongoing in schools and children have started to make those acts themselves and the source is one child who will have been operated on and decided to come to school to school, this situation is very dangerous to the community and this generation.
The teachers will also be ready to cooperate with the teachers to ensure that the issue is controlled by explaining the children immediately they see those actions be taken against all those involved in those acts.
