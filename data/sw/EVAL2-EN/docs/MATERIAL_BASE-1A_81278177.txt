Samia has started a campaign of my tree.

It has been written by me.

It has been published in October 2016.

Tanzanians have been urged to climb trees in the whole country with an aim of removing climate, which has contributed to change in the behavior of the country.

While launching my tree campaign yesterday in Dar es Salaam, the Deputy President, Samia Suluhu Hassan said that after a human being faced with a environment that happened is a punishment.
I have heard a saying that the father of the Holy Francis when he was speaking at the second meeting of nutrients in the year 2014, he said that a human being makes a sin because it is wrong to forgive him, but you do a mistake for the environment not to forgive him, "said Mama Samia.
He also said that the results of the first environment is dangerous, floods and that every Tanzanian is required to clear the mistakes so that the environment can be difficult instead of separation.
Samia said that as a plan is to choose, then every person is supposed to respect the environment so that they can celebrate and return the forests and explanation that the behavior in the country is usually caused by decency in human activities including industries.
"I was a guardian of the environment that I would like to take this campaign to be the whole country where we have paid 20,000 trees in this province and everyone had the responsibility to serve the care of the region," he insisted.
