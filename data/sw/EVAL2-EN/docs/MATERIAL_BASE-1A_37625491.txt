Kenya did not need the referendum for now.
By Bashir Yakub.
The vote of this decisions are taken by citizens so as to give their decisions about the important issue that will contribute to improving their political life, economy and community in general.
We thank you remember the decisions that we made in a few years ago about the constitution of the year 2010. Finally we decided to large numbers for our constitution to pass and use in use later.
Now, the former prime minister, Mister Raila Odinga Odinga has announced that he did not want Kenyans and return again in the decisions of the decision.
At the time, Mister Raila claims that Kenya is faced with a lot of problems and he is facing us to vote and decide whether we will continue with this government or we will look for alternative ways to enable them to solve our problems of corruption, tribalism.
Minutes Network of this kind, Kenyans have faith here and we believe that every time we become problems with the administration of the country we ask for the decisions to change the constitution, this is not a solution.
When we look at the moment we see the deaths in the security agencies, the police and the army need to wake up and use the modern practices in dealing with criminal incidences.
I have seen that in this column, often you will discover that your head has written on the heart of skin disability, in the head, you will look for a period and to give him different treatment instead of also to also give that head treatment.
Therefore, the issues spoken by the commission of boundaries and managing the elections (the IEBC) that could destroy the law, minister of safety, Joseph Ole Lessly Nyami and that we should have public meetings - which could be able to destroy the country into the threats of violence that will not be used for now.
We need to plan the right plan to rectify the mistakes that we have been once for time.
