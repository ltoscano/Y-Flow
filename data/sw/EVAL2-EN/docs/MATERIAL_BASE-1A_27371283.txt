The Provincial Commissioner of Dar es Salaam, Said Meck Sadick, some people who want to do demonstrations on Friday this week have explained that those demonstrations are not involved with the concerned authorities because they did not get a permit for those demonstrations can endanger the country's office by the prime minister cannot be presented to the office.
Victory should be spread saying that court has been found.
To come out in large numbers to go to the court.
The accused of listening to the case with Sheikh Issa Ponda will happen if he is not given a bond of Muslim protesters in the date.
Next month and one as I have already explained.
For the meeting.
They want those protests.
But in the provinces we explained to the heads of provinces because of the heads of provinces and to Zanzibar they go to the office of the president.
And not where we had already said, it's about the occurrence of a threat to peace in the world.
Now, the letter has been written by the honorable prime minister, when they receive the protests.
Now if I know that I don't know the office of Prime Minister here, while they have not seen the instructions is the province of Dar es Salaam, I have seen it to be careful because the demonstrations will be avoided so that he is not given.
He did not end up because they had been ending, it was clear.
