We've heard that the end of the take buses (the mobile phone company) and believe in the time every province had its transport buses, we were with the central railway of Dar, Tanga and Moshi which has gone to the residents of Dar and Kigoma provinces to work after recognizing our weaknesses that was entertaining in the country, should not hesitate to fall in investment of industries, should not depend on with Nabisubi Kimaro, Kilimanjaro.
