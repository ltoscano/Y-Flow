Government in order to prepare themselves.
Managing director of health and other stakeholders in this sector in the country have changed the strength of other diseases like AIDS, malaria, and chest and leaving the Dengue fever disease.
It is not the first time this year to be only fever that is heading to be a threat in the country and the world as a whole, but every time came out of statistics spread in the media.
I have not heard of sustainable campaigns to provide education or to provide vaccination to take place all over the country.
This is a rumor that has made this disease continue to spread in the country.
The government will take this responsibility to ensure it gives education and vaccination to its citizens because there are no treatment of this disease.
Ministry of Health also wants the need to give vaccination to all people in the country who are not affected so as to reduce the possibility of the big problem here in the country.
We shouldn't wait, the problem should be big, the body has the best than treatment.
