He said the energy has been operated on in Sweden and some of the villages in Rombo district and it has shown success since time to cook food was a short time compared to other energy like wood, 1000 and electricity.
"The energy is very high costs, you will see here and this is the one that was used for top boxes, what you do is used for the sun, you will do a fire without food," he said.
