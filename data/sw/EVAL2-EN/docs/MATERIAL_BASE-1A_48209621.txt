Yanga, Azam matches to revenge.

It has been written by Grace Mkonga.

I was heard of 16th October, 2016.

The defending champions of the Tanzania Mainland Premier League, Yanga will battle against Azam FC at the league game that will be played at Uhuru Stadium in Dar es Salaam.

All the two teams this season will begin well but Azam is with a bad state after continuing to rise up to a day due to misuse of Yanga, although Yanga will not accept to lose their match heading to defend his title.
Azam has been closed by Ndanda FC 2-1, scoring a draw against Ruvu Shooting 2-2 and scored by Stand United 1-0.
At the moment the team before yesterday's games was under eight points with 11 points in seven games.
Also, Yanga after being defeated by Stand United 1-0, already dropped to Mtibwa Sugar in the last game by scoring 3-1 at the Uhuru Stadium.
Both teams will be at the field having a goalless draw in August this year where Azam emerged with victory by 2-1 goals after a draw of 2-2 goals in the normal minute.
Yanga before yesterday's games was in the fourth position with 14 points in seven games, with one second one.
Those teams each teams met with pressure every one wanted to get good results.
Things are not well known if there is one who will agree that they may be, one coach of Hans Van Pluijm, Yanga or Zeben briefly said Azam does not continue to understand the weather while they are in danger of being evicted.
Another game that will be played today is Ruvu Shooting against Mbeya City at the Mabatini Stadium in Mlandizi.
Ruvu is in the 11th position with nine points in seven games, while Mbeya City is in the seventh position with 12 points in nine games.
That game may be difficult, because all teams will be happy and everyone will need to get good results and go to a safe place.
