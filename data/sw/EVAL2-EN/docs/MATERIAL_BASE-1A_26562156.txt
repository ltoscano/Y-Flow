The Executive Director of Sikika, Irene Uwoya, said that yesterday in his meeting with journalists in his office in Kinondoni, Dar es Salaam and explained that one of the reasons for the shortage of drugs is the government to set aside money and give enough money to meet the needs of the country and important medicines and medical equipment.
For example, the current needs for medicine and treatment equipment is more than 521 billion shillings, but the budget set for this year is 20,000 shillings, where among them, 108 billion shillings is true that there is a shortage of drugs by 47 percent.
In addition, he said due to the experience of educating and working in the health sector for approximately 10 years, it has requested the government to look for the need of health centers for public health equipment, instead they will be independent and decide to buy from any person who is being controlled by the government.
He also urged the executives and leaders in the health sector to work professionally instead of politics, while explaining that the shortage of drugs and medical equipment is not a new problem but it's a long time and the government has been thought but now it has been a great problem even causing the shortage of drugs for a period of more than three months.
