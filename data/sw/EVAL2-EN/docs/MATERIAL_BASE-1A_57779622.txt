Poor have a dream of Wema Sepetu as a member of parliament.

It was not unfortunately, the journey of Wema Sepetu heading to parliament has reached an end.

That is after failing to convince the members of CCM in Singida province to give him a bond of inspecting the parliamentary seats.

Wema has failed to play in the opinion polls of the parliamentary seat by getting 90 votes, while the lead in that contest is Aki and Mighty One, Martha Mlata (63) and Diana Chilolo (182).

Wema has agreed to fail and claimed that his participation has given his courage.

"I have decided to contest for a special seats, I know that there is a result of lack of this phase I have lost, but the world is still ongoing," he wrote on Instagram.

"I commend and I thank God to support me, God to continue supporting me for your love you, if I thank you, I thank you the courage and I have a new strength to allow you afresh," he added.

"2015, it is a unique year in the most expensive youth in Tanzania, Bhebey Ndey which was born by the Revolutionary Party and I will die with the Revolutionary Party and I will go back with the Revolutionary Party and I will go back with the Revolutionary Party, that is the first time starts."
