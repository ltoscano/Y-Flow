Secondary education officer of Mkinga District Council in Tanga Province, Jumaa Kombo has given seven days to the head of the school to ensure they put the picture of President John Magufuli in those offices.

He also said that he has decided to stop the habit of using books for registering visitors, like the ones that are used in the sleeping house, instead they look for a special way for the use of government offices which have been destroyed by the nation.
He made that order when he spoke to journalists so as to explain the various actions that are being taken by the Department of Mkinga Secondary School in improving the school's head offices and the school environment.
Kombo said, secondary schools and other areas at the village level have been used to receive various items, thus lack of those equipment is reducing the status of those government offices.
"Primary school, the head of secondary school in addition to address the rule of administration of his school, he is forced to serve the citizens including parents and guardians of students in the concerned schools especially in these parts of the system of providing education without payments," he said.
