He said he has been receiving a lot of complaints from elders who claimed they have not been given identity cards from the department that deals with issues of elders in that province, so he wants them to prevent them in order to get involved in the concerned ministry.
Doctor Kebwe said elders are supposed to be signed and to get members identity cards in the provision of their services and the plans to be sold for the budget for medical services.
