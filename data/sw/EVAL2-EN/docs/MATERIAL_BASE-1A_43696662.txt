You can take their children to school and have a good house because of farming.
What is making it in areas.
For a certain amount of coffee, we use opportunities available but I can say that because it is.
It is by few percent those opportunities we consider some of the farmers.
We are required to farmers the citizens who are getting those opportunities through organizations which is being started by the government.
To start groups.
Which the group we need to support him from development but by a large percentage of the farmers about those teaching.
For them is difficult to say that farmers are using those opportunities only seven percent, they got the help to use a big challenge that is facing the farmers.
That is a big challenge, a very big challenge that enables many farmers to be sold until when they do the businesses that they decided.

When we get in Dar es Salaam city, I feel extremely honored and I think it is good.
The Film Board.
So as to know and be close to.
Farmers be able to have a good price for the purpose of being able to sell their grandfather's home, it is a challenge they have farmers to produce their crops for fear that the farm and he does not have any reason to be successful and he did not meet the people.
