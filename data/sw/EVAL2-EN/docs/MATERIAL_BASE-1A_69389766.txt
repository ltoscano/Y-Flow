Jux has a responsibility as he told him from what he has never occurred in any picture from the university she got from China.

Many of the stars have been using Instagram to break the photos that show their lives and in everything they do, but from the R & B artist, Jux is on the front which he has put up between things she can be washed away from that network and his private life.

It is known that Jux comes from China, but he has never released any picture showing it is in a university environment like maybe he gets a ring, while carrying bags or partners in his show or on the show.

After being asked if there are other things that he has done there different from the university, and if truly reading it is why I have never met with any other pictures of the university, this were his answers.

"I believe I believe here, you know me in my life, Instagram is my friend and I decided to do what I do because of people, I know what I do I do because I don't know," Jux told 255 of XXL of Clouds FM.

"The class is not part of the picture to pray for someone, the first one in our place, can't read my thing and I don't know what I'm in class, I don't know what I'm in class, but I am happy and I'm in one because of their studies."
