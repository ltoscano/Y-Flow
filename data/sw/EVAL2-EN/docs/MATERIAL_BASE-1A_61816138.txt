Yanga coach, Hans Van Der Pluijm has said that he is not worried about the issue of being left behind by Simba, mentioning one of the ones that give the some the charges are in the provinces where Simba has not played even one until now.
After their last week that he finished in a 1-1 draw, Simba has continued to remain in the top with 17 points, won five matches with a draw.
Pluijm said he has great faith that Yanga will do well in his games at home stadium and that other teams that will go to the provinces including Simba will get a big challenge, therefore he urged Yanga to be worried.
Pluijm, whose squad has 11 points, has explained that being left behind points is one of the competition in the league and that there is still a lot of matches in the league and that there is still a lot of matches as home and that it has not been released in the provinces where there are heavy activities.
In addition, we have witnessed six points, but this is the league and it has a lot of matches, there is a broader field, if you look at a lot of points by winning at the home ground, they have not managed to fight away from one match.
I think that after playing several matches out and getting results, we will just look well concerning the gap that we put on top and you can't have sure that it will be losing away, but we believe it is possible that when it comes up, "said Pluijm.
