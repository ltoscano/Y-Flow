The Amana Hospital has been given a donation of 40 sheets and other products for the purpose of the children's ward that were donated by CRDB Bank, Kariakoo branch.
That bank has given that donation as part of the commemoration of the customer service week of that bank.

Speaking at the time of handing sheets together with those products to the chief medical officer of that hospital, Doctor Koheleth Winani, the manager of that branch, Andrew Augustine said that the action is a procedure to return to the community.
Augustine said, they have handed over 100 sheets to be giving thanks to the community in the customer service week by giving them that they have also used good relations between them and the customers of that bank.
"We will continue cooperating with helping others in various social issues, because we recognize efforts and challenges that are there in the health sector when we will continue to strengthen our relationship," he said.
Speaking about bed sheets together with water, with mental disabilities (juice) and soap for a washing machine, Doctor Shosho said that those sheets will be taken to the children's ward for one day up to 28 and therefore help those children.
He said those sheets will help to reduce various diseases because every child is in the diseases and that is why children are set aside according to their age so as to avoid eating diseases.
He said according to the guidance of the World Health Organization (WHO) one child is expected to use bed sheets out of 15 to 15 for a day, therefore the efforts are supposed to be given to enable that issue.
