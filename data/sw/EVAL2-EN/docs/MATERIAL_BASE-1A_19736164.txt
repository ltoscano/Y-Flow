The National Identification Authority (NIDA) has said the National Identification Authority (NIDA) has said that the national identity cards that were donated will continue to be used until the day they will announce the procedure of posting them.

In addition, it has said that new identity cards will be given to those who registered themselves but they did not get their identity cards due to the crisis, in order to start giving new identity cards.
Speaking with this newspaper, the head of the communications unit of the authority, Rose Mdami has said some citizens have been arriving at the authority's offices in different areas as they want to change their identity cards.
Mdami has said that those with the previous identity cards will not be involved with new identity cards because they were injured as usual.
"Those who have those identity cards will continue having them because they are used as usual, the procedure to change we will announce later, citizens with the previous members believe they have been changed later, they are confirmed to participate in various offices to change their lives," said Mdami.
He said the new identity cards have already begun being provided and that the work is sustainable until when they see all citizens who have the reputation of national identity cards.
The authority announced to start changing all the old identity cards that have not signed, while expecting to give new identity cards with the signing of all citizens, who have completed the registration procedures, including fingers.
For now the identity cards have already begun being used in some of the services especially in the bank to open accounts and to confirm the reports of someone before getting services.
