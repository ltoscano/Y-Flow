The former Yanga player, Nngoma Khalfan recently emerged victorious, after scoring all two goals in the first match between the Singida United team and police in Dodoma that took place at the Namfua Stadium in this town.

In that match, I have been witnessed in Singida United having three points by scoring the police in Dodoma 2-0, Nariadhara scored one goal in every period.
The former Mtibwa Sugar player and Yanga scored the leading goal in the eight minute of the game after making a surprise attack and defeated the ball.
Nicrox, who plays for that team by her younger Razgrad, scored that goal after receiving a classic pass from Rashid Gumbo before the point was impressed by Nelson Kasanga, Ibrahim Mertesacker played with Ismail Mbiku of Dodoma, then he released a stern warning that won in the goalkeeper Abdallah Shaban.
The second half started with all the teams to play in shifts where the police in Dodoma would have risen up but their efforts did not have fruits due to their attackers not being keen.
I'm looking at the last hole in the coffin of the police in the 83 minutes after a draw that came about the police's goal and the scorer taking one shot on the goal area to write the second goal in Singida United.
The referee Saidi Pickup, from Dar es Salaam, who used well in that contest was forced to give a yellow card to the defender of police, Nelson Kasanga, in a bad game against Gumbo yesterday in Singida United.
In Singida United that is sharpened by Coach Freddy Mari is leading his group of rhino Rangers (Tabora), the Police (Mara), Mgambo (Mwanza), Mgambo (Mwanza), Mgambo and 13 points in the five games that had already been sacked.
