Sumaye has given 'Fulfill Your Goals (CCM), when he was forced to call him Lowassa.

The retired prime minister for the third phase, will be free and fair, then the union of parties that make Ukawa will win and get into power.

Sumaye has said he has a great percentage in the opposition to have a great opportunity to win Katina in the next general elections is that one reason that made him remove CCM and joined the opposition.
Being interviewed in the second period done by the Azam television station, Sumaye who was the prime minister for ten years in the third term government has said that he has seen CCM because he has seen that the state in that party is not good and that there is a great opportunity for the opposition to get in doubt.

Sumaye said he has not joined the opposition by being promised a court and that the main aim is to give advice since he believes has a great experience to kill him and he will be a donation to them.
Speaking about corruption where previously he was quoted saying that she will not take CCM if that party does not have the ability to ensure that he has not been a problem with Doctor Magufuli but he has never happened anywhere, he has never reported to the name Lowassa.
"My war of corruption have started my own life and there is no place where I have seen Lowassa being the most importantly, the parliamentary report has never mentioned Lowassa to participate in any criminal issue," said Sumaye.

Regarding the ownership of great land, many citizens of land have no land, Sumaye said he does not have any problem to own land in the country while saying that 300 megawatts will destroy their disposal.
"If you put the leaders and check the size of the farms we have, I will be last," said Sumaye and added.

"This is now a farm is a sin? The country that is going on, people who will remain in agriculture will have a great land."
Sumaye added that even if Ukawa will enter power, they will not return to CCM and he will improve the opposition.
