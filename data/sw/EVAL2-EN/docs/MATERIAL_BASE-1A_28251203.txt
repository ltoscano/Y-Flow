Four matches of the Tanzania Mainland Premier League are expected to be played today in different stadiums for three important points which will help them in a good position in the stand.

JKT Ruvu will welcome African Lyon at the Mabatini Stadium, Mlandizi province, Coast, Kagera Sugar against Mwadui FC, Majimaji against Mtibwa Sugar at the Majimaji stadium, Songea and Mbao FC against Mbeya City at the CCM grounds, Kirumba, Mwanza.
The officers of JKT Ruvu started with one points in the opening game against Simba and they were in a draw without 2-0 in the game that was played at the National Stadium, Dar es Salaam last week.
It was meeting with African Lyon which does not have good results after playing two games and lost only one points against Azam FC and scored by Yanga 3-0 goals.
As a result of their last results, everyone must face three points and live in a good place.
In addition, Majimaji FC will be at home to welcome Mtibwa Sugar and it may be demolished after losing two matches in the past, they were ending up without losing away against Tanzania Prisons having 1-0 goals against Azam FC 3-0.
Also Mtibwa Sugar is looking for good results after winning one game against Ndanda FC 2-1 and scored against Ruvu Shooting by 1-0 goals.
For Mbao FC has only one points that it got against Stand United after a draw of 2-0 goals against Mwadui FC the game against Mwadui FC a 1-0 win, therefore it may fight today against Mbeya City which has four points although it also needs good results.
Also, Kagera Sugar and Mwadui FC need to win as the results have every one needs 8 points after scoring against Stand United and Mwadui that three points won against Atletico Madrid and scored by Toto Africans 1-0.
