Our hospitals do not be.
Engineer I urge you to fulfill your opportunity to give my advice to the government through the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare.
It is about the procedure that was set starting on July first, where the brothers to the Muhimbili National Hospital will be 6000 shillings per day for the purpose of food services.
This will be a good procedure if the patient will be asked that it will get involved in the concerned day.
It is the normal state that we were used to all the patients asked, they will be able to do because they feel that day.
Now Muhimbili will be able to come up with a food schedule because it was a patient will be forced to eat it even if it doesn't know it.
This procedure is same as they sell the patients to be the prisoners.
Patients do not choose food to do, together with this procedure, you will make sure you get more because brothers they have visited and give them what they want?
