In addition to the same time you thank the mother of the elderly, I would like to take this opportunity to inform you in another period again and sometimes the stage of the platform and the youth.
As it is the fees in this period in order to bring together different youths who has been selected in various political issues.
And other things, maybe about the issues of education?
In a series of marriages that we have been if we continue to focus on issues of politics.
And if he is a sister in the past period, we were looking for youths but those in signing the intention to vie for the councilor's position.
They got the opportunity to speak to another youth again, but it is not another but it is to bring him the teachers.
He is not there.
This is the first time until the end, but it is what I used to prepare without stopping the soul of Kikwete.
