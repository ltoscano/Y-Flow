The workers of the United States in South Africa have continued to have demonstrations to claim the salaries instead of going back to work and start working as they have promised there.
The workers have protested in that mine and spread in other mines owned by the mining company, sending them their colleagues to continue claiming their rights.
These police will make the protests of those workers but they were in the scene area witnessing what was going on.
Those workers have said their protests will be in peace if he did in those demonstrations, therefore the police have no reason to be careful.
The strike of those workers is getting in the fourth week.
At the same time, the leadership of three parties' workers are meeting with the leadership of minerals owners in the country.
To talk about the ongoing conflict between the employee and employers.
That meeting is not a representative in America because they are still continuing with demonstrations.
