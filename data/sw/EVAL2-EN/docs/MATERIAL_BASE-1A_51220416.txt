It is impossible that citizens do not have guilty of losing their lives despite the efforts being put up to fight against the problem even so that these nations have decided to reduce the workers from its embassy in addition to taking another precaution.
It is also important for Kenyans to recognize that the safety starts and they will be a lot of challenges, especially those events, from time to time, citizens have been admitted to the explosion and when many times it has been revealed that there is a explosions that is followed so that there was a explosions that was accompanied by those who did not place there.
Even so, they should come out of the terror attack, it is important for the government to continue with its efforts and to make sure that what is happening in the country it is obvious that the western countries do not understand the great issue and the reason for Kenyans will also be identified.
It is hope of many that the attacks will be able to end because and raising fear, will contribute a large number of people to lose employment especially in those areas contrary to the tourists.
