While speaking to the nation today, the Executive Officer, Mister Charles F. Mlingwa, said the health of Kenyans had reduced, especially banks and milk it must affect the lives of the fish, animals and people who use water from these areas.
This is following the order by the American government to give out the notice of wanting all plastic products to be handed to the market for a period of one year with 150 nets to be banned from July next year.
Yesterday, Mister Rwegashora said that the Mazizini, the country will be taken to lead that committee and we have already succeeded in order to inspect the plastic chairs to different products especially the beauty ones.
America has said that many countries in Europe have banned most popular products of beauty which are forced to clean up and clean the teeth that have been given more than to use their products.
But analysts have discovered that products are committed and plastic chairs are faced with life of fish, animals, and analysts are still continuing to get married if it involves people's lives.
Mister Obama said that he has been given enough evidence to show that those popular products are used in large numbers and those plastic chairs are seen to be filled in rivers.
That law said it is a must for all the companies of beauty products and also the drug abuse is easy to leave the neighborhood that could not have a clean business or be it must be productive.
