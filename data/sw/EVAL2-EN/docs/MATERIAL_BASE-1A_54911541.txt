The natural gas pipeline from Mtwara up to Dar es Salaam, which was completed its construction last year has been handed over to the Tanzania Company to distribute gas (NFRA).

Moreover, after that act, the cost of gas pipeline in homes is expected to start next year.
The handing over took place yesterday in Dar es Salaam city between the acting director of the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC), Mister Musomba and the Deputy Executive Manager of China Petroleum Bulk Procurement Agency (TPDC), Joseph Zhang Jihadists who were working in that pipeline.
That step is giving an opportunity to unite issues that are in Mtwara, Mkuranga, Lindi, Kilwa and Dar es Salaam where the use of that gas in homes is expected to start being connected early in the year Mister Musomba said after being handed the pipeline, which they will start selling gas in different areas including homes.
