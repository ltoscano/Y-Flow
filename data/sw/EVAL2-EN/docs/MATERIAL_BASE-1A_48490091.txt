The whole step is not enough.
The decision by the provincial commissioner of Nairobi, Doctor Evans Mela asking the work of the government officers of he said that he was following down of a building in the city is the best, although it has been made late.
That building in the neighborhood of Islam where four people were killed was the second round in the period of three weeks, and there have been other events like in Nairobi.
Every time when that event is witnessed, experts of construction issues and even the ordinary citizens came out about the way corruption and arrogance do not contribute to the construction of poor eyesight which put the lives of residents in danger.
Before yesterday, some of us have never been taken back to the necessary weight and instead of citizens who are not guilty, they died or injured while heavy rains were cast.
All the leaders are a must that it can be able to take quick action when things get to the blast.
It has been a habit of chief leaders to wait until when water continues and take action that they believe will help them to rectify the situation.
It's just the last year where we witness the big terror attacks in the country, and despite the call from leaders and the citizens wanting change in the management of security issues, there is no step that were made up to the blood poured.
When you get to the end of the collapsed building, it is needed that we use more steps to be taken apart from being stopped from the officers.
It is clear that there is still heavy rains in different areas in the city that has not been built through the foundation of regulations is needed to be followed.
If it is true that the government of Keko has said that it has helped to save the residents due to the heavy rains when the earthquake fell, it will be better for us to be sold immediately to recognize heavy rains and be demolished quickly.
