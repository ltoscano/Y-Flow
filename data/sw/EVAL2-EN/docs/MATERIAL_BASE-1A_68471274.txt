Dar es Salaam, while playing in Mbeya City, Kinama Para, will not affect the bridge of Yanga to win the championship of Mbeya City, Yanga will play with Yanga on May 10, while Yanga will win that game which will win the premier league matches because Yanga will win the game against Simba and Azam even if they won all the two games.
Phiri has said the citizens of Malawi said they will agree even a bit that Yanga will play for their championship again at their field, Sokoine, therefore will give him a chance to make sure they get a victory.
He said they need to win so as to get three points that will place in good position to remain in the premier league next season.
Therefore, the match is important for us because we need three points to ensure the opportunity to remain in the league, but we also need the victory for all our games to come, but we believe that Yanga has planned to pay for our home again in our stadium, that is not allowed, so as to prepare them, "said Phiri.
If Yanga will be unable to score against Mbeya City, then we will have to wait for their game against Ndanda and that will be like Manchester United how to prevent Leicester City to win the championship at the Old Trafford stadium, last week after those teams drew 1-1.
