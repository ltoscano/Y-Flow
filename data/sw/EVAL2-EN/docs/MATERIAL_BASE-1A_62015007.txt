While in the claims of today the death of the coach which is starting from March to me, I've never seen him in the secondary school of this season while I am forced to teach in ten years and two of being a third position and he was a player of the school team.
And they were playing the position of the city.
After finishing.
He started work.
And there it will play football later, he was followed up to be taken against him.
For a period in which I have been with him in the picture.
And he is a player.
I would say that he is one of the players who had.
They are those who play my son and following the law, a politician, you know it is a chance which is very important.
But Absolom went after leaving football as coach Marcio Maximo, I have collaborated with him when he started being the coach of TAFCA every time when he was running a course in Mwanza, I was going to teach in class.
In the period of football laws, we were cooperating with him from when I remember the last time it was last year when he continued to course in which there was a question and he was giving training on the football law in Dar es Salaam when I call the football laws.
I believe that many youths have benefited from.
Many remember the day before yesterday in the match that was played for Yanga and Kagera Sugar, the players from Nigeria are saying that after scoring the goals he had interviewed he said that it was because he had a lot about her teachers for that, we have many youths who have passed away and there was a match with many youths in Mwanza province.
Having a national team even if they were chosen to continue but they were in the camp there are many youths who had a chance.
To show without their ability to play and what is now we need to do what is the period.
We look at the things that you made, how can I continue to start us.
