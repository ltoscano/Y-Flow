These health workers are a nuisance to patients.
There is no difficult time for a human being like when he is in hospital nursing the parent or another person, the person wants to see everything you will go as they want, including seeing the patient gets every medicine or the service he was told by his doctor.
Bad luck in some of the hospitals, the situation is different, because there are some workers who use their positions to benefit from a person who was admitted to the hospital and they tried to give a certain amount of money so that a nurse is a doctor to give a lot of money for favoring a ward.
Most importantly, there are servants who ask for money the patient who had a shortage of blood so that they can register themselves' because they get a person to buy blood.
