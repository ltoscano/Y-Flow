Wiz Khalifa Tiffah has gone into his phone with her mother's mother.

Diamond Platinumz!

Previously, Tiffah has given that decision a few days after the birth of Diamond Platnumz that he spoke about that, he is a normal culture that, Bongo movie star is not a problem.

However, when Diamond giving out that explanation after giving out words that "microcephaly" that is related to superstitions has claimed that it was unable to boycott the mother who did that exercise.

After Tiffah has gone up and "drugs" for a few months (something that is not normal), then when she went into difficult decisions to go against the culture and his fellow parents and decided to take him in the same way.

Another evidence has decided to do that seems to be on the recent photos that he was posting on his Instagram page where one is that Tiffah is paid by what he does not have.

Following that decision, some of them said they intend to get Mamuya while giving me that what he is not same.

"You know that it is a culture of his brother, he was supposed to respect even if they are, that is when he went to Sawazisha 'and her mother is not same," said a fan of Diamond who identified himself by Mariam.

Diamond was not found immediately to talk about the decision of his fellow mother.
