Dar es Salaam City, head of the national development unit in the country, Kim Poulsen has said he will be satisfied by the success of Azam's mid-fielder, Omari Mussa who for now is in Spain for playing soccer soccer.
Speaking to this newspaper in Dar es Salaam city yesterday, Poulsen said he feels a lot about the steps to arrive at the place where it is now in Spain where he did the football trials.
This is one of the players that I was with and at the time I was given to the youth team, many times I insisted to be self-employed and consider the discipline of football.
"I know what he is in Spain is on trials, I believe that he will succeed to reach far, he is a youth who doesn't know him," he said.
In addition, Poulsen got more than 80 percent of players who were with them in the period of the national team of youths, they have succeeded to get married and now they are playing various clubs in the premier league.
"This is intended to give a lot of advice, players like Kessy (Hassan), (Shomari, (Shomari), Mashauri (Mao), who are some of the players who used to grow their standards at the time.
"It is a time to fight to ensure that they are not to try to play soccer.
"This is not enough to have better strategies that will help to make better players that will help the national team later in international soccer," he said.
