Take care of the child.
Among them a one-year-old child, yesterday was faced with an error in the age of loitering, after being beaten by a mother along the roads of Charts, in Maksimir Stadium, Eliona.
According to the hosts of that area, they got the remains of the body of that child in a place where he was thrown out and was conned up to ten o'clock in the morning after that incident.
Mister Fred Kadiliana, one of the residents, said that when they agreed with the remains of that body, when he had gone to capture him up with one stone on the roads in that village and then see ZANU PF in the body of a human being.
"It was a speed at two hours when I went to carry out the white house, I would like to throw words at a very normal life, I would like to inform me at the normal life of a child," said Mister Karamaeli Mnjokava.
When I met according to Mister Werema,, he was able to prevent each other where the neighbors were able to come to witness and help in the cause of a person.
"It was a very surprising thing that it does not know if you're doing, where the neighbors were able to come to witness and give them to sack him," he said.
Said Mister Karamaeli Mnjokava.
The residents of now want the investigation to be cleaned so as to identify the child a place, so that he can be forced to inform me, that claimed that the third child was chased away from that place.
"This is a third case because last year, we were able to build a lot of two children in different cases so that we should not know who is doing things like this," he interviewed.
