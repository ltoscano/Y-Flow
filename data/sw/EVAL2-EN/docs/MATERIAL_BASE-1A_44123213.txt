What is our stand about South Sudan?
December 31st, 2014.

In recent days, Tanzania has been heard in many international issues and many now know our place in politics of Africa.

We have troops in protecting the peace of Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in Africa and our police are still participating in the United Nations operation in Arsenal were caught up on.

Tanzania has done a great job to resolve the crisis in Madagascar.

Our country has not brought the forces to protect peace in Somalia because we explained the country it does not continue to protect peace in the country in order to protect them.

However, in South Sudan, where there are fights that are continuing, Tanzania has not ratified its stand and bad luck, he will not be seen even if there are private schools that are affected.

We have heard that Uganda's parliament comes about what is happening in South Sudan, even if he is wrong, but President Yoweri Museveni did not take his army and put it open his position.

Until today, this nation did not know if there are his people in South Sudan and if there are some people who have ever been released by the government about South Sudan is where they want them to seek refuge in the Kenya embassy, Juba.

However, it is not known as there are many who went to them if there are many who have in all countries that surround us, such reports have been raised by the government every day.

We think there is need for government to put open the stand of our nation about this conflict in Sudan, it is good and explained that our place is what we are doing and what we are doing what is in ensuring that South Sudan is come back in his normal state.

This current silence is being accused of being traitors in the most popular song of "human being, all of my brothers and Africa is one."
