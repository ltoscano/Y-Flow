This week students of class seven have done their final examination of the primary school so as to wait for the answers of getting to form one in the year, January.

After completing that amount of those children, now they will be at home for waiting to start form one while others doing the examination of joining various schools and for many in October, they have joined the studies before joining form one.
In this period, which is the first in the month of the month, there are many children, they will play in television and check different issues while they learn about things that are not fit, while others get well in the future of their lives.
It is clear that now the world has been destroyed by emerging various actions against ethics and even with the faith of God is against it, therefore it is good for this time that children have a lot of time to help them by teaching their home jobs.
It is good to make sure that the girl child is doing all at home, to be a sister to work or mother in that home, while being faced with home at home, while the male children need to work hard and get into groups that are not fit.
As a result of that women are the head supervisors at home, it is good to ensure that they prepare for every day of work to do and have a short time to rest than winning the issue that will make him think about several issues that are not good.
It is dangerous to leave all the time while on television or in the big phones that are there at home, there are many events that are dangerous and well if there are a lot of events in the youth and the upbringing of involving themselves in order to improve and grow.
