Dec 80, 2015.

There is a time when Maria Nyerere got asked a question from the writer, the author told the mother Maria Nyerere, "recently, how come the teacher who left to live in a very normal state without having many assets and others are educating their children outside the country?
Mama Maria Nyerere asked the writer, "I see you are still a very young man, it is still a lot for you to know the same time, because a leader was able to do a difference with what he received and he urged his fellow leaders in their leadership in it."
Yes, in the current procedure, and especially after getting rid of regulations, we lack ethics and ethics of the teacher's leadership, it is common to find leaders with business projects, farms and industries as it is not stealing time to serve the citizens and even using public resources?
It involves this question and who will be in eternal peace, if there was a reason that I got their relationship and even after Prophet Muhammad was born and he is a must to give them the poor, orphaned children, passengers, citizens and others who need.
People have been set aside, there is no one who contested for booking tickets, even those who attended the materials were integrity, they did not receive several times when they had gone to the pitch and even when he went to do so, he decided to do so, then he decided to do so.
That incident a plain truth when the guest of Chakwama, called Abdulaziz Makame asked, "what is why it gives a candle to begin the journey and starting on another, then that is in eternal peace and starting the first one?
Khajida Kopa, the rapper told Bongo Five this candle to be the government, when I see the reports of my family, I see the time I asked the news of my family and I see that, that is an incident that has put important teachings about the whole process of ethics in the public service.
