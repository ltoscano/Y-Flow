Manchester United coach Jose Mourinho has said that the referee for their game Anthony Taylor "will be a difficult time" at Anfield Stadium after his appointment was criticized early.

Liverpool will welcome Manchester United at the English Premier League game that will be held at the stadium.
The host will take on today while they are in the fourth position with 16 points, while Manchester United were in the seventh position after losing 13 points.
Taylor comes from the city of Manchester City and the decision to appoint suddenly in the Liverpool game today night, brought up a lot of words from the fans of that team and the person involved to select the referees.
The former assistant referee Kenja Hovind, has denied the ability of Taylor Swift, he said that the game needs a high speed.
Mourinho last season was banned from playing at the field after his statement against the referee that refereed that game between Chelsea and this is his first time to speak about Taylor at a meeting before the game, but that Manchester United coach is putting it open his feelings.
Mourinho has said that Manchester United will agree to agree with violence and congratulated Taylor on how he refereed that match this season, Manchester City is leading in the English Premier League with 19 points equivalent to Arsenal but is on a difference of a goal.
