General of Dar es Salaam Province, Alhad Mussa Salum has denied reports written by some of the media that President John Magufuli has refused to meet the religious leaders.

While speaking to journalists yesterday in Dar es Salaam city, he said that those reports have no fact that they are supposed to destroy the president and religious leaders.
He said that he is among the religious leaders that are seated with senior leaders of the Citizens Union Constitution (UKAWA) and decided to see the president after requesting leaders of the opposition parties to go back to parliament and requested them to stop demonstrations and they agreed.
He added that, the report said that until now the president has already answered a letter of religious leaders that were written in three weeks ago, something that has no truth since the leaders have written the letter of wanting to meet the president on September 19 this year.
