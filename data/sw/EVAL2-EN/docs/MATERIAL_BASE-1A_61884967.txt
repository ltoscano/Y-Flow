The complainants won.
London's England Football Authority, FA, has said it will help spongers to the striker of Newcastle Club.
That act did not be seen by the referee because it happened in the morning when those players met and insisted that the ball on the corner, but after FA did not want him to address that issue.
His panel of investigation was looking at that incident that emerged victorious in the match that Cedars-2 goals against Everton 3-2 at St James, and decided to sign up his striker, charges that can bring a ban of three matches.
The Senate's star was unable to answer up until he was unable to answer those allegations or agreed that the ban will be implemented immediately.
If he will fall down with the incident, then Cutch will succeed in the league match against Bribley tomorrow and the FA Cup against Leicester.
