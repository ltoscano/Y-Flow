Dodoma. The government has said that all machines that have been destroyed by the Ocean Road Institute are made, it has been explained.
Deputy minister of health, community development, gender, the elderly and children, Doctor Hamis Kigwangala, gave that statement in parliament in Dodoma yesterday and added that there is investigation that is done by the government to identify the reasons for two specialist doctors in that institution to be transferred.
In a question by the member of parliament of Tucta, Rashid Ali Abdalla (CUF) wanted to know if the government understands that the citizens are getting rid of medicine services in that hospital and which action is being taken against that problem.
Doctor Kigwangala said that the government seems to recognize the problem of availability of medical services in Ocean Road and does more efforts to solve.
He said one of the challenges that have been working is together to cater for the treatment of citizens that be known to have the disease.
The Deputy Minister said in the year 2011, the government in collaboration with Bugando started construction of cancer institutions in that hospital.
Doctor Kigwangala said the institution will increase the ability to deal with cancer which previously was being stolen from the Ocean Road only in the country.
