The laboratory equipment for secondary schools worth more than 12 billion are expected to arrive in the country at the end of next month and will be now a school before the start of the first term in the year.

The Minister of Education Science, Technology and Vocational Training, Professor Joyce Ndalichako has noted that when he spoke to journalists when he toured Mbeya Province.
Professor Ndalichako has said there are approximately 30 kilograms of laboratory equipment sponsored by the government from Russia and England which after arriving will be distributed in secondary schools especially among the laboratory that were built by citizens.
He has said the aim of the government is to see the laboratory should start working in January next year after the school was opened by students to start a education term.
"The equipment will arrive at the work of starting, it will start just one time so that the school will be opened in January the laboratory that had started working as we decided to protect our money because when you get a lot of eggs and also a source of accidents," he said.
He noted that many laboratories since the citizens are expected to complete his construction with sharp teeth because it can be used as a result of lack of equipment and that's why the government has taken intentional efforts to buy those equipment.
However, he emphasized that distribution of equipment will be keen on important criteria and that is why they will be distributed to secondary schools that completed the construction and that will take place after verification.
"We cannot be able to take any school because it's only secondary schools before the distribution of we will be able to be satisfied and those who have reduced, they can be able to take equipment so that the concerned building is used for many days," he insisted.
