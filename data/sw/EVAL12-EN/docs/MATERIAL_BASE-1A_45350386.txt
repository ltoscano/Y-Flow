The Tanzania Post Bank (TPB) has given a donation of a building of five pit latrines at the Ipinda primary school in Kyela district worth nine million shillings.

Among those holes, two vehicles will be for the purpose of female teachers, two of the male teachers and one for the students with albinism.
Speaking during handing over the building recently, the senior relations manager of public relations of that bank, Noves Moses said that they have given that donation after receiving donations from the school's committee claiming that there is a need for better and safe toilets for teachers in that school.
He also said that the school did not have a permit of being used by the disabled and instead use normal toilets that were gives a difficult time due to its infrastructure not meeting their needs.
Noves said many times the stakeholders of education look at the needs of students and encourage teachers who have challenges in their work environment, that do not give education as required.
"We have decided to give this donation after being touched by the shortage of toilets in this school, because these children are all our children and it is our responsibility as parents to see the importance of this issue and help them," said Noves.
The guest of honor at the event, Lusillile who is the head of statistics and equipment in the education office of Kyela District, said that the donation is very big to the school because the school did not have the ability to implement the construction project of that building for now.
The head teacher of Misitu Primary School, Subira Kibacha thanked the Post Bank for that donation saying it was not easy to implement the construction of toilets and that is why they were forced to ask for support.
