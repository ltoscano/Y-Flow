We thank our citizens, we believe that any theft happens due to private faith in the party or the concerned parties is not a must to have a close relationship with the tribe or people, and therefore we do not want to believe that some of the suspects in theft of public property, and therefore we do not want to believe that some of the suspects in theft of public property, and therefore we do not want to believe that some of the suspects in theft of public property, and therefore we do not want to believe that some of the suspects in theft of public property, and therefore we do not want to believe that some of the suspects in theft of public property, and therefore we do not want to believe that some of the suspects in theft of public property, and therefore we do not want to believe that some of the suspects in theft of public property, and therefore we do not want to believe that some of the suspects in theft of public property,
We thank the wisdom of the minister of state, the office of the president (parliament and coordination) William Lukuvi, who was happy to ask for the chairman who leading the debate in parliament, he wanted the statement of that member of parliament that the suspects of corruption have done that crime because it is abolished.
Although we assure you of that member of parliament but also in a certain way we congratulate and recognizing the mistakes he made and finally, he looking for his statement which it is clear that it would have been left to cause hatred among the pastoralist communities.
We insisted that in the corruption war, we are supposed to fight against corruption cases and not to fall into consideration the primary issues such as part of those involved or a person, but they should not be satisfied with the dirty intention of the party or those involved.
Perhaps you would like to see our Parliament that takes place on the grave of tribalism or discrimination of any kind, it is not good even a little of the parliament to move in the debate that is not the name of tribalism, religion or discrimination of any kind.
We shall see our time in the direction of building one nation, with love, peace and solidarity among the citizens of us all in the country without caring for our citizens and therefore we give them an opportunity to stop corruption in our country.
Tanzania without racial discrimination, depends on or sometimes it is possible.
