While in the television program dubbed 'Channel Ten, the chairman of the Editors Forum, Mister Absalom Kibanda said that Magufuli is praised Tanzania by building a road because people have not come out of the country and to see our colleagues build the road while he said it is people to have a solution and not knowing what is happening in the world.
This is telling us about the words of my friend who does work in Ivory Coast, who also once asked me to thank you, for building the roads what have not seen, our colleagues are capable, to help Mandela at the same level and to join Magufuli, it's just a solution.
