Doctor Mwakyembe issued the statement yesterday in parliament while responding to a question by the member of parliament for Rufiji, Mohamed Janabi, (CCM), who questioned the short procedure that was made by the government to prevent the payment of 80 percent per month to retired judges which are their primary right.
He said that the payment of salaries and benefits of the judges in accordance with the constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania, are paid 80 percent of the pension fund to the retired judge after getting and inspecting all the important documents from the court and the relevant authorities in the community.
"If the number should be used to be paid the pension fund of every month and PSPF or any fund which she has contributed, worth 80 percent, it is usually paid by increasing the amount of money that is supposed to reach 80 percent of the income of the judge who is in power," he said.
He said the retired president should not be paid for pension funds by not knowing the criterion of contribution in the fund which is a period of 15 years, 80 percent of the pension fund of every month is usually paid by 100 percent.
