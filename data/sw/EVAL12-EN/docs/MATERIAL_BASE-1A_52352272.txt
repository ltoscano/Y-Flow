Tumaini for farmers Bambucha is supposed to announce their crops.
And whoever doesn't come out, it may be a cry for farmers about the lack of digital market fit, after the Bollore Logistics company of Africa said it needs illegal immigrants.
The head of Mister Vogue Bongole said that Bambucha is supposed to more than 30 million tons every year so as to make clean water and good health that will be sold here in the country.
Mister Rished said that when he was signing an agreement with the head teacher of Shem Emam, Miss Ruth Bura, who has joined the farmers from Meru area which are involved in the murder of soya, illegal immigrants.
Mister Rished said that for now their factory has received 15 million tons from 12,500 farmers who are in East Africa and said they have the ability to receive more crops.
He said this will be paid immediately after the produce were received in their factory.
He encouraged the farmers to join and do a campaign to rise and sunflower.
He said the market for the two produce in the world is very big, because its oil is safe for health compared to other oil.
"The sunflower and normal oil is safe for health and it will be accepted all over the world. I think we should consider the farming," he said.
Miss Chiku Gallawa added that the project of involving all the Meru farmers will be distributed all over the area so as to achieve the project to bring more farmers from every day activities.
Mister Rished said that for now the selling of oil has improved so much because the Kenyans are very involved in their health by using clean oil.
A lot of areas in Kenya have a condition of climate change which can be able to contribute very much in the murder of soya, illegal immigrants.
