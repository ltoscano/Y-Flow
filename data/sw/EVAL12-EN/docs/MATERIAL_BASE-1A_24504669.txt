Government needs to reduce the cost of electricity in homes.

The government has announced to reduce the cost of collecting electricity from 1200 shillings in the previous years up to 24,786 in the villages.

Previously, the reduction was issued in Lindi and Mtwara provinces where a pipeline to transporting gas to Dar es Salaam started, but now the costs will be in all villages countrywide.

Speaking in Dar es Salaam yesterday, the Minister of Energy and Minerals, Professor Sospeter Muhongo said the cost will involve projects sponsored by the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) in the period that the contractors will continue with the second phase of projects that are expected to start on March this year.

Muhongo said that in the first phase of projects that ended in December last year, there were a great cost, therefore the government has decided to reduce those payments, so that the energy service reaches more people.

However, that offer will last for one year and five months only, because the second phase of the projects is expected to start on March 2014 and end in June 2015.

"The cost is for the period in which the contractors will be at work only when the contractors do not qualify for the coming of electricity," said Muhongo.

Minister Muhongo has pointed a finger to the contractors of the electricity projects in the villages saying they are being involved with bribes because so that primary schools do not end electricity in their houses.

In Bunda, there is a rumor that he was a employee of the company that supports the bribery, the company has been given a stern warning and they should not be treated again, "said Muhongo.

He also wanted the Tanzania Electrical Supply Company (TANESCO) and REA not to use a huge cost of paying for buildings or modern farms because history shows that the exercise is going on with bribery.

"We have a bad history when it comes to the issue of compensation, it has been filled with bribery," he said.
