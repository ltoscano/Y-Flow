Where is where I went?
APR of 23rd, 2014.

In this newspaper, we have made news about the controversy of where he is a suspect in the case to drive out of 130 grams, Kamnada Ahmed (32).
It will be remembered that in the case of testing the animals, including the four women, Kamerhe is also the one suspect in that case that was opened by the United Republic of Tanzania, at the resident magistrate's Court, Kilimanjaro Province.
In that report, we have explained that the case against Kamenya and three others who are Aisha Mashimba, was mentioned on April 17 this year, in Moshi town and the suspect did not happen again in the court that was played again.
The act of ran away from the court for the third time in a series of case in court is a thing that depends on doubt and there are some people who believe that the suspect has thrown out.
We have explained that because, already the resident magistrate of Kilimanjaro has given a certificate of arrest of that suspect wherever he is, after not being seen in court for more than three times without a report.
We would like to remind me of the authorities of Tanzania that, the issue of preventing throat cancer is not of the game, not the issue of competing between the suspects and who benefited from that event but it is an issue of defending the nation's honor.
Among things that have no shame, this nation is illegal exportation of animals, including Twiga, which is the eyes of the nation.
We expected to continue the authorities of here in the country to be careful in the running of this case, including supporting all suspects in order to ensure that their absence was affected by more than that, he had not affected the rights to change.
Why is Kamnada continues to appear in court without a report for three times, there is not wrong the court and the United Republic in general which is supposed to view this case keenly so as to remove the truth of the presence of a dirty game and to protect the honor of the nation.
