Ngasa continues to work with the name Yanga, Big Results Now, wants to get 6 million shillings for the month of or else they should be known.

Yanga has touched me that it does not have one goal to leave the striker Mrisho Ngassa and in order to confirm that in actions, already the leadership of that club has shown an average of 80 million shillings while it has signed a new deal to stop his team.
One of the fans of the club who is in the registration committee has said that their leadership under the chairperson of the club, Yusuf Manji has no intention of wanting to be removed from Ngassa where he has already signed the offer to make sure he sign a new contract.
The boss said in that offer, Ngassa has been given two important conditions where he has been forced to use part of those funds to end his debt of the bank who is claimed to have a salary of 4 million shillings to move as it is.
However, the salary issue is going on with an offer that Ngassa wanted to be given out by that club while it was forced to be paid 500 million dollars (5 million shillings) for a request that Yanga leadership has been closed down.
"We have no intention to dismiss him from Ngassa, there are things that when she knows, he is speaking so much, I don't take care that our efforts we want to remain here," said the boss.
"We have heard that offer, but his problem is one of he wants to be a lot of income, an extent that he has wanted to have a very big amount if he will not understand that in this he will agree to sign."
Ngassa has been supposed to ask for his decisions of refusing to send his offer to El Nino in South Sudan, when he was in Simba on loan from Azam so as to shoot Yanga fans with a punishment to pay the Wekundu wa Msimbazi goals that he had signed previously before going to the park.
