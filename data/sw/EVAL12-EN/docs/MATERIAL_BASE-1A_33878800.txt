In our newspaper, the edition number 309 of July 31 up to August 6, 2013, we witnessed news with the news reporter, "Iddi Azzan, a member of parliament or different authorities concerning the allegations that were directed to that member of parliament to deal with drug trafficking.
We were unable to get a member of parliament to speak about that issue and therefore, we came back to some of the news that he has given to some media stations in the country, we want to quote this decision in the concerned news that we got in, as we believe it's expected to meet the port (understood).
However, because our efforts of giving him that member of parliament did not be able to give them fruits in the concerned day, we request to apologize due to any discomfort.
Apart from requesting him, we continue to communicate with him so as to give him a chance to speak about that issue and others concerning her position as a leader in the community.
They are still going to respect the opportunity and the contribution of Iddi Azzan in the community, for his position as a leader although we promise to continue to do our professional work, like security (OPD) on behalf of the community, especially in monitoring the trend of leaders and leadership issues.
