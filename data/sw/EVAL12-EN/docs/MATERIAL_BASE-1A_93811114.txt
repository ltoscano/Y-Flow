Ras Kiduku was continuing well.
Most of them are very drought.
Now there will probably not be any thing that we used to believe my condolences, I have read a food food.
Ras Makunja has not know you must be a must for you to go back home and not his home is not close to them and we have said today to go.
And I have heard that anything did not know if you are not good for us to have a good thing or you should not be noticed, then it is not good.
We must not be done by the work.
It is a must that or the other hours you can be or do?
I cannot have faith in Nairobi, you know that there is no farm which will go through the farm and it is the one that will get money even if they are proud of having a lot of money even though they are proud to get to us.
