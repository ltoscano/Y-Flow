I was surprised by Saleh on, APR, 2016.

The efforts of TANAPA to protect the animals that are in danger.

And Said Nonetheless, Arusha.
Various foreign affairs and outside the country show the number of wildlife including elephants and livestock has continued to reduce the situation that causes sustainable developments of our resources.
Some of the research shows that more than 45 million elephants are equivalent to 90 percent of the 50 million elephants who were in Africa in 1930, are believed to have been killed by poachers in the African continent with more than 50,000 shillings.
Here in the country it is believed that the year 1988 was there by elephants between 250,000 and 300,000 shillings, statistics of the year 2002 show that those elephants have reduced up to 16,000,200,000 shillings and therefore the recent statistics show that elephants are not more than 55,000.
In those statistics, it is clear that elephants have risen up in one month and approximately 10,000 elephants that are losing life by poaching, a situation that caused the existence of two big and good governance in the world.
The National Social Security Fund (TANAPA), is the one with a bond of conservation of the animals in the country having 16 teams.
Among those drugs include Serengeti National Park, Ruaha and small park located in the provinces of Kilimanjaro and Tanga.
On some of the national park, Serengeti shows a number of elephants has reduced from 2,500 in the year 1985 to 500 in the year 2012, while a sum up to 70,000 people's views in the period.
But so much, even the small animals in the world have been reduced to the park in the period from 1000 to 20 years only, those are just one park in Serengeti, we have touched me other cargoes at the Tarangire national park.
Thanks for the efforts that are being done by the government, various foreign institutions and outside the country, with great nations in the world like America has helped in fight against the crime.
Those efforts are the ones that used the existence of a plane of the Blind (BCIC) with the ability to vote on Wednesday night without a pilot, run through special computer machines.
But also together with the defense of the plane, TANAPA is prepared to ensure that the number of those animals and others that are in danger of their disappearance.
The Executive Director of TANAPA, Allan Kijazi, says that many accidents are still in a natural vegetation despite some of the animals.
"Others are in a threat of disappearance, but we are prepared to ensure our animals that are in the danger like the elephants, bird feathers and others remain safe at any cost," said Kijazi.
