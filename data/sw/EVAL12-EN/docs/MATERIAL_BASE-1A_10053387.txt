President Kikwete thanking you an example of Uhuru Kenyatta making the fight against drugs.

For sure that president of Kenya is an example to be followed.

He is the president who previously did not speak with his politics but after the start of serving Kenya seems to be a good leader and the truth in his nation.

This is as a result of him managing director of the National Security Department of that country, where despite recognizing its importance and its ability, but due to incidents of explosions and bombs that were thrown in the country, he decided to make her to know the security commissioner without considering the personal interests and to be taken by any foundation.

It is not big more than all that he is an act of this president to visit the ship that was carrying drug abuse and killed in the Indian Ocean Areas.

These drugs are estimated to be worth 1 trillion Tanzanian shillings.

This is sad and it is maturity as the president asked in the country that those drugs are treated to be the concerned ship in the country.

Honorable Jakaya Kikwete giving an example of this human leader.

If these events have been arising from the country but we do not see a stern action against them.
