I would like to see that we will get to the East African media, we are told that in Kenya the general meeting to discuss strategies.
In order to ensure that the next general election will be opened today in town, where political leaders together they have agreed to supervise the strategies is not in order to maintain the country and violence as it was for a two thousand year election.
That meeting involves politicians and managers of the law.
Including the members of parliament and senior directors of police.
The award is open and an easy thing is together with other leaders.
We have urged all Kenyans in general to carry the responsibility of ensuring that election.
It will be free and fair to a step that will come in the presence of peace before time and after the election.
