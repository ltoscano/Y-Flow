England gets to remove the tourists.
And apologized.
British Ambassador in the country, Christian Turner, has denied the claims that the country ordered tourists to rise from Kenya due to lack of security.
The Ambassador said that the British citizens left in the country by voluntary following precaution about the threat of attacks in Kenya.
"The manifesto released was to advise the England citizen to travel to Mombasa when I need to do so, so I want to be careful that we did not urge the England citizen to be stopped from Kenya," he said.
According to him, it is a few tourists who decided to return to them through voluntary after the manifesto was given.
England gave a certificate to its citizens about the lack of security in the country last Wednesday, and was sent again on Friday after the attack occurred in Glasgow, Nairobi.
To remove the tourists that manifesto resulted to several tourists that they had visited Mombasa and decided to leave, a situation that caused a huge loss to business people in the tourism sector.
It has been reported that some of the hotel in that town have started reducing the workers from a huge loss.
President Uhuru Kenyatta also congratulated the Kenyans to be visiting the tourism attractions so as to fill the gap that was left out by foreign citizens feared being lack of security.
The Ministry of Tourism and National Tourism Board (KMU) are required to try to encourage the Kenyans who come to different areas in the country, with also aimed at different nations like China.
Kenya depend on tourists from the United Kingdom, America and other nations of European continent with many Kenyans doing a tour during Christmas and Easter holidays.
