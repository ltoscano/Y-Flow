The national team of youths under the 17 years of Serengeti Boys, yesterday was defeated 1-0 by Congo Brazzavile after failing to qualify for the African Cup finals to youths of that age.

The final stages were expected to take place where Serengeti got into the match being ahead by 3-2 goals, they got the first match that was played at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam two weeks ago thus Congo will qualify for the an away goal.
Serengeti reached that step after it had gone down in South Africa.
Tanzania has never managed to qualify for those finals to the youth so that Serengeti didn't qualify.
It would have been done so for the first time after the arrest of the competitions in the year 2005 and it was removed after it was revealed that they used a player to return to the age.
The big team, Taifa Stars has ever played for those finals this year 1980, Nigeria, while the women's team Twiga Stars won in 2010 in the finals that took place in South Africa.
However, Serengeti has taken a step by reaching that step since all the years the youth team was to end the previous steps.
