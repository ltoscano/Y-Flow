Those areas where the government has agreed to work on it is the responsibility of the media to follow keenly the public of Tanzanians in general and be able to provide information about different events in human rights and non-governmental issues who are concerned with issues of human rights, who is the one who was born in that workshop.
He advised the efforts of local government to start using great efforts in many areas of human rights and administration.
Our here is to try to encourage Tanzanians to know.
Being on behalf of them the government has said.
It is going right.
In issues of things.
And if we don't know that you are sick in the government, it said that the government said it will improve the rights of education due to people who have the right to get treatment.
