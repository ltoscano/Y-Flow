The Legal and Human Rights Center (LHRC), has given a statement of condemning acts of two police that took place in Ngara district, Kagera province.
Speaking to journalists in Dar es Salaam yesterday, the director of the center, Doctor Helen Kijo Bisimba, said that the killings is a huge violation of the human rights.

He added that the government is supposed to take action so as to make sure that the acts of people to take action against the community are taught.

"We give my condolences to the leadership of the police force which had lost its directors and we have condemned all the killings that were kidnapped by the government to take action against all those involved," he said.

He said the killing of citizens and police which have been emanating from time in the country is the great danger to the nation and contribute to the hostility between the police and citizens.

"I urge the community to leave the culture of going against this law, this is dangerous to the future of peace and calmness in the country," said Doctor Kone.

He added that their complaints against the government as a result of those affected in the country, have already taken place to the International Human Rights Commission (ICC) which have begun to be worked on.

On September 28 this year, LHRC, confirmed the government as a result of that court for failing to take action against the murder of different people who are not guilty.
