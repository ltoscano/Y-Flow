More witches will be given to appeal to camp.
Edmund Rutaraka who visited the market women who do business in this market, have continued to take stern action against women who are increasing the cases of witchcraft so as to attract customers and to lictions of their colleagues.
This claims that after one woman claimed to put bones presumed to perform well in the body of her neighbor, those women said they have been witnessing the cases of witchcraft in that market and they will agree all the witches in that market because they are still in witchcraft.
It is reported that those women were annoyed after one woman claimed that they will be found to make sure that she will be involved in fighting the child of his neighbor until he started bites from stomach.
Later he was found that he had put bones presumed to be in the stomach of that child that was to be used to marry off when they saw the witches.
