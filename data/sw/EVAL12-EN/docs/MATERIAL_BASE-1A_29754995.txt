Wassira visited Siwema who was involved with the results of Ester Bulaya, when he was extremely honored.

A few hours after the general meeting to announce Esther Bulaya will be the winner in Bunda Town constituency, the former member of parliament of that constituency and his opponent, Stephen Wassira has come out and oppose those results.

Wassira said that those results are not legal and that there is evidence that have been done so as to bring him down and to deal with Esther Bulaya.

Wassira who was also the Minister of Food and Cooperatives, has claimed that the results announced had a huge problem including the number of votes that are seen as they were cast in the general elections.

He said that the supervisor of the elections encouraged the computers in those results and that Tarime, those phones led to the number of voters in one center to continue to be announced by the National Electoral Commission and the veteran politician, has also claimed that the supervisor of the elections announced the results without considering the election law.

Ester Bulaya and Wassira are big political rivals who started a big competition in that province, Ester Bulaya, as a member of parliament for special seats on the CCM ticket.
