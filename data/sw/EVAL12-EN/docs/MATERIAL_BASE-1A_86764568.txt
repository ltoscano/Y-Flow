Last week, I arrived at my friend in his office and among the issues that we met are energy in social networks that are currently available.

Social media has changed the lives of a private person and the professional also, and that is the biggest company today doing a big business decision and investment by considering social media networks.

The use of this network is one among the people who use this network for business people and there are some who use the environment especially to explain their thoughts about different issues that affect the community that surrounds them and also concerning the national and international issues.

Evarist Ndikilo, the situation is among the most good users of social media networks especially Facebook and Twitter.

Maybe I would have decided to explain that he is a Tanzanian who is the right time and for now it's living in England.

Also, the Swahili teachers at the Glasgow, England, the writer of books and article I wrote a book that he has called 'Snowden?

Furthermore, the situation is a good user of Twitter and Facebook and up to this time, I have written this article being followed by users (724), 4224 girls and following others (follow up).

Escrow Account, a situation of together with using social networks for the purpose of announcing business and things as we do, is also a good pursuer of the few things inside the country that was born in Tanzania and the world as a whole.

He is also a good member of politics in America, especially the ongoing campaigns of the elections in that country, this is because of the fact that, many times you write about those campaigns.

Among the most popular artists, Evarist Ndikilo, the situation is spreading on Twitter, is the minister for internal affairs, Mwigulu Nchemba, the Minister of Labor, Transport and Communication Professor Makame Mbarawa.
