We want to register our girls before giving them when she gets.
Many girls here in the country are not expected to live in their studies and because they are getting early their studies.
As the community we are supposed to be transparent and to lend girls together with boys from participating in a marriage act so as to save the new generation.
It is also a shame to see men of great age as they contribute to this situation by defamatory words including their daughters.
Some of the girls get pregnant through rape and cut off their shame in life, it shows how the community has failed and its results are of stopping the mosques and the Permanent Committee of the Huria University.
