They gave that request while some of them being comforted by deception in front of the Rukwa Regional Commissioner, Zelothe Steven, who visited the scene the day before yesterday.
Zelothe who arrived at the prison to see the problems and work performance, he gave an opportunity to 10 prisoners to talk about their problems after the prisoners, Oswald Urassa and reading messages on behalf of his colleagues during that tour.
Prisoners who were given out a chance after that life was advised to reduce air strikes by the court to give birth to the courts, such as poor eyesight.
After listening to the prisoners, Zelothe Steven has asked the head of the prison for every one to be given to vote for what he saw.
"Thank me me, I have decided to come up to me because I recognize my responsibility and also in a statement by President John Magufuli, and I have come from my team that I don't know it, therefore be calm and patient," insisted Zelothe.
