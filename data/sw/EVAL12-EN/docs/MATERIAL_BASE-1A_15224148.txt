The Municipal Council of Tabora, has been charged a fine of 12 million shillings and was required to go down within two weeks, due to the laziness that is causing the destruction of the environment.

It is said that the council used the waste away from different areas and switching off roads.
That step was made by the deputy minister, Office of the Vice President (coalition and environment), Luhaga Mpina, through the National Council of National Housing and Environment in the country.
Mpina was on a three-day visit in the province with the aim of inspecting the environment, to check the state of cleanliness in all areas and to meet the business people that are surrounded by the lower level.
He said that the Municipal Council of Tabora is the first to be fined due to their carelessness and failing to implement the order released by the president.
