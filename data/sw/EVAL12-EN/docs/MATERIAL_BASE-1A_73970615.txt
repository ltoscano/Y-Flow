This should be a very happy year.
This is the year that is expected to bring high events to the sports field.
There are events that are unsatisfactory performance and without doubt, there are all the hearts.
Some of the good results are expected to be due to the athletics profession, as a shortage, where Kenya is expected to shine at the Olympic Games for the World Youth League, Diamond League and other athletics including Marathon.
In the competition, agriculture, as usual Kenya has the ability to do well on the side of paying the fees especially at the Grand Prix D which in Kenya it has reduced the status of the second level after being involved in the race for the last year in Cameroon, February 2016.
There is a certain amount of hope in the recent game especially after the national team, seven players who qualify for the Olympic team and started well the series of violence in the world of Irene B, a woman is accused.
But many, for the basis of the previous results, perhaps you should not make Kenya well especially in football, but it is our request that apart from Kenya, there will be a need for leadership of Kenya including the Tanzania Football Federation (FFGM) and the government to raise them more in this game that has been very much in the world.
It is clear that Kenya comes out in the fight to qualify for the World Cup after bad management "to market a fashion model" Harambee Stars won in the hands of Cape Verde, following him to deal with yourself.
Along with the finals of the world, Kenya also did not participate in the African Champions League (Uganda) which will be in Rwanda starting next week.
However, if he is an enough opportunity to rectify the things, not in soccer, but in other professions also, especially with the intention of moving them in the competition to donate.
In soccer, for example, there are matches to qualify for the African Champions League (AFCON) where it will be better to take up to one feet.
