Youths are supposed to take advantage of the work outside.

The youth have been urged to utilize the plan of 'work out of the country, which is under the United Nations (UN), so that they can save their lives and stop complaining.
The coordinator of Mapango, from the UN, Mister Louis Mkunde, said that in Dar es Salaam yesterday when he was opening a training on entrepreneurship for youths outside the school.

He said Tanzania is a country with many development opportunities like business, livestock, agriculture and others but there are many youths who are in the streets that do not have a lot of income.

"This is a time for the youths to take this opportunity and to stop complaining, we should not ask for young people from China to save this opportunity because this program has aimed to bring success to the youth and unfortunately, it will not exceed 60 times," he said.

On his part, Miss Wiz Khalifa opens the UN's department of communication, he said those training involves 100 youths from three districts in the province of Dar es Salaam.

He said some of the youths, others have different skills in their groups and therefore the training will help to use the opportunities available around them.
