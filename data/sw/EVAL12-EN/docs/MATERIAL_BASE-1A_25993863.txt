An opportunity for the police force.
Kristen 31, 2013.

The reports of the police force in Tanzania will give job opportunities to youths graduates of form four and six graduates, we have dropped for a huge warning and at the truth, we would like to be careful among the concerned parties in the agency that has the responsibility of ensuring the safety of citizens and their properties.
Basically, the report of wanting Tanzanian youth to join their fellow citizens and their property, by any way it is good news but it is good that we are receiving our statements by considering the experience that they got in days, two years ago.
The experience shows that some of the mistakes that they were found with some of the police officers are to give training to people who do not want to be in the army people who do not have faith, it is clear that he can meet another criterion for an example of education.
It is correct to get education officers on the level that is called by the police force in Tanzania, but it is also important to have a high level of education who go to join the police force, it is good to recognize that the responsibility of enabling the youths of getting to the police force is very important to a huge number.
They should know that the responsibility is a great opportunity to improve the police force in Tanzania and that it is not an opportunity of removing bribery or not to put a good image of the youth members who want to get into the police training, at the cost of the police force will be constructed by the youth with discipline, sending and patriotism.
The best way of the police force cannot be made by groups of youths who have been involved with the army with the criteria of bribery, it will play or remove any kind that they have said, if those commanders have appointed police to qualify to participate in their studies because their appointment is not by luck, not by favoring any kind.
Although it is correct for a lot of patriotism I have dropped among the bad news like the police force and elsewhere, it is a must to get few people with correct criteria than to get accurate information that are not correct for our advice, but to get correct people, at the right time, for the purpose of correct training.
