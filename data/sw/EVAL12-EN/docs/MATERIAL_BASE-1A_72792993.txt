Farmers of livestock will sell their produce at least fifty acres of fifty acres under the new law that is blocking the farmers to get benefits due to the purchase of potatoes.
Minister for Agriculture, Naiko Doctor Stanley Chisholm, said that the new law will enable farmers to get great benefits to win earlier.
"The previous law had asked farmers to sell their cargo on suspicion of 110 acres, something that caused some of the areas that contribute to the nation's economy by promoting food and therefore it is important for the government of the province to cooperate with the main government," said Teacher Kisongo.
