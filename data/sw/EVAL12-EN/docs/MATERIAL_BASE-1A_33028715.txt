I was heard of 16th September 2016.

The head coach of Mwadui soccer club Jamhuri Kihwelu 'Julio "has said that their game against the defending champions of the Tanzania Mainland Premier League will be difficult.

Mwadui will be the host of that game that will be played tomorrow at the Mwadui stadium in Shinyanga.
Speaking with this newspaper yesterday Julio said that he knows Yanga is a good team and with the enthusiasm to defend his championship, but also they need three points by using the home ground.
"Yanga's game will not be easy if it happens, Yanga is the defending champions and they have been doing well in the last international tournament, but together with their quality, it must be able to win," he said.
He said sometimes you can believe your squad will win and where it came in the field, an issue and playing different from the expectations they had put in place.
He said that in that game it is a must to ensure they get a victory and be in a good position.
The former coach of Simba said his players are going on well for the preparation of that game as they expected to give him points in their home.
Mwadui FC up to now has four points after playing four games and won 1-0 goals against Toto Africans 1-0, against Toto Africans, 1-0 against Stand United.
In the last season, Mwadui was forced to a draw of 2-2 against Yanga at his stadium.
