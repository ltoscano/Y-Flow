Honorable Abbas I told that Minister Mwijage!

It is good to have a dream, again, a very big dream is to help you do a solution, to make sure that you know, what should happen, you want to grow, it has the real environment of implementation of your dreams.
The country should be able to have a dream of our dreams as Tanzania is to reach the central economy, even if I don't know what is available, the increase of money from the citizens but if we feel it is true that the economy is very fast and Honorable Hussein Bashe, has said that what I did by brother Mwijage.
Again I wrote on this page, this newspaper!
We thank you a dream of the fact that those killed themselves because of the ten percent share the ones that were forced to revive industries so that you want to revive the market, but you want to revive the market, but you want to revive the market, but you want to revive the market!
