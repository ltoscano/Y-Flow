I feel extremely honored by being impressed by the name 'Personally'.

I hope that I have ever been found!

The eyes problem with my wife is that for now it is not recognized as we did not get married! We did not walk up to my friends, most of them is that every day I wanted to do with him and he told me not to do that.

He started dain and saw me I have no status.

The parents of both sides have committed to them this without success.

Now I have seen before taking any other decisions, I have decided to involve your advice. "Nisubiri"
