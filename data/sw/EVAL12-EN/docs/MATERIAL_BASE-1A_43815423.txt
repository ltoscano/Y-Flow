There is a big need for now a team from South Africa to strengthen themselves so as to be able to provide opposition to the finals of the World Cup.
The results of the African teams in the World Cup finals in Brazil, have been compared to the time the changes are done in forces that will participate in the coming finals.
For many years the soccer fans of African soccer have been giving up to see one of their teams taking action even more than the semi-finals at the World Cup, and this has been charged with poor results of African teams that have been representing the continent themselves.
As a question we thank you and we are our representatives in this semi-finals it reaches a question and without doubt, it is a question that needs an answer quickly especially considering that this continent has talents to attract so many clubs to play in Europe.
If the teams that represent Africa in the world cup finals would like to make steps then it does not have an opportunity to start investing early even if they have started several hours in the coming finals in Russia.
The finals of Brazil should be a new beginning in the African continent, where it should be understood that in the world of soccer there is no poor or a tyrant, both teams have the ability to win another team by doing so, the dream of that cup to come in Africa will give him a thirst for fans of that game.
We are expecting to see one of our representatives of our representatives, to move up to the semi-finals in the next season in Russia and this is if the representatives will start preparations for early numbers to be ready for those finals.
