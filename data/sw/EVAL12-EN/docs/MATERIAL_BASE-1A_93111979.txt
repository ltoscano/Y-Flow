The Municipal Council of Zimbabwe (MARI) has banned two international radio stations for failing to invest in what happens a lot.
The council said on Monday, Clouds FM, Clouds FM, has confirmed to reach the needs of their license to set aside, 24 months to promote their advertisements in 36 months after getting a license.
The sun is getting into the licenses in the year 2011, an issue that goes against the station that is owned by Zimbabwe Premier League (ZBC) and the had lasted since independence during 1980.
"The council has heard that until now, Clouds FM has set up or only 10 months, though the Star FM has set aside nine months depending on six months after refusing to attain 36 months to end," he said through a report.
"TOKIU is raising those stations that they are required to provide national services to November 22, 2014," the report added.
Mchaga said that it will start to inspect the steps that the stations have reached in implementing the license.
Star FM today with one company of the newspaper that is being controlled by the government, though the Clouds FM was started by the Deputy Minister of Information and Broadcasting of Supa Mandalya.
The donation of the licenses for those companies will be used so much due to the relationship of those stations and the party of President Robert Mugabe's ZANU PF.
The government has been getting seven days to give the private security licenses despite the court unable to make it so.
