Despite scoring a 1-0 victory in the premier league match on Sunday, I thanked the heavy rains that are already caused by defending champions Gor Mahia.
It has been noted that the board that runs the premier league, Kraehenbuehl has decided to stop the procedure to give Gor 500,000 shillings every month as a result of the payment of investigations into its matches through South Africa.
Kraehenbuehl has been amant to give out that amount to each other, the money that is given to every club that is participating in the premier league every season until when that club will be able to solve their conflict of paying tax of 50 million shillings that are claimed by a certificate of fees that are being taxed.
According to the secretary general of the Kvitova, Jack Oguda, his office has been advised to stop the payments until Gor Mahia.
"It is true that we have tried a whole plan to give Gor Mahia that has benefited from that decision and more than all, we will continue to make sure that that they are solving the problem and after that, we will continue to give those funds so as to prevent them," Oguda, he was quoted.
