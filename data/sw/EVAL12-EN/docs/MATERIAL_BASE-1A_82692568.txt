I am very happy.
Probably, the from Temeke and Morogoro is not into the semi-finals of our nation's cup that is going on at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam.
Our writer in the morning he had gone to report.
His results were unable to have finals after being read in Kinondoni as the third goal by scoring but which is in the final game that was played at the stadium of this nation is ready.
Previously, before the start of the semi-finals of the competition that will be played in netball games where their team had already opened a victory and lost five hundred and five hundred thousand dollars, they had ever played for fifty-five goals.
The netball team Temeke District is under their opposition members of Kinondoni and then elephants.
The members of parliament who attended the competition of netball games and requested the council to help the team we are preparing for various competitions for our questions, whereby you are doing such as a good thing for the councils that are playing with the team that will play with the team that will play with their complaints.
Member of parliament for Temeke, Abbas Mtemvu has used that opportunity to give a donation of money of one million shillings.
The party's party in that game that lasted for the competition.
And Temeke for reasons.
It has been organized well, I will not make the rate of Temeke is organized.
And our expectations that we will take the cup for us?
While receiving that donation, the chairperson of that operation, Anna Mghwira has said that the donation had reduced as money that had been required.
The national team even in the continent of Congo Queens will leave the date of seven heading to Zanzibar where he still need.
How do I register us.
This is the first citizens are invited to finals of that tournament that are directed to meet Temeke and Morogoro teams during the closing of the competition.
