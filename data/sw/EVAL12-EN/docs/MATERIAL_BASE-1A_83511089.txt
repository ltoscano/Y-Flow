President John Magufuli has said the media has the responsibility of encourage us to use the opportunities available in other countries.

He said those opportunities are like the Swahili language, where local language are required to be resolved to teach that language outside the country and to get great revenue.
The president mentioned another area that enables you to go out of the country to get an opportunity of doing entrepreneurship, which can bring great revenue.
He said that while responding to a question by the Executive Director of TSN, Doctor Jim Carrey who was surprised by the chairman of the SADC organizations for defense and security (SDG s) and also the chairman of EAC, we have a need to encourage Tanzanians to use economic opportunities available in other countries, instead they do their opportunities themselves.
