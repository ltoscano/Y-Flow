Late Marijani Rajabu.
I have written here in my friend and I look at my friend and I look outside the weather it is not good today, palm and cold drinks, most of them are very bad, everyone in his environment he likes to be used to.
I have lived here in us to listen to the late Golding, about when she gets married, love that do not be treated with pain in a soul which had a lot of pain when it is used to live in life.
Our culture is popular while this document is pumped by a wife, her lover with a voice of pain, but if a speed can continue with life even if a high speed is difficult and of giving up.
There is a heavy rains like palaces, a prayer for my friend.
I asked me, our website has gone where and we shouldn't have that which he has been going on where assets were not a big part of our life more than life, calmness, wisdom, wisdom and peace for these things have gone to?
At all times I believe in development it is the process of the economic and social changes as a foundation of special issues of culture and environment, and therefore we look for the real situation of the citizens, it is your progress in our soul?
Development projects are beginning in your soul of those affected, required to invest in home is a very important thing and it's not easy for us to know how our country's love is there and even if you have changed the love you, "we are happy, but many they are leaving."
I met here, I am listening to music at my friend, in a clean environment, apart from your bad state, but your soul is not aware because there are people who have a bad state, but the road is not yet known, but this is the real situation.
