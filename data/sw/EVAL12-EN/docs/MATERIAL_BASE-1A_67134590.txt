RC, directors as they walk to complete the desks.

It has been written by Fadhili Abdallah, Kigoma.

I was heard of 16th September 2016.

Kigoma province has failed to implement the directive by President John Magufuli of removing the problem of desks for the set time.

That issue has removed the provincial commissioner of Kigoma, Brigadier General Emmanuel Maganga.
That leader has said, directors and committee of managing the desks in the council have been unable to implement their responsibilities.
While speaking when handing over a motorcycle to the directors of the council that will be used by coordinators of the ward in that province, Maganga said that the laziness is caused by the directors to fail to fulfill their responsibilities in removing that problem.
He said in a period of the whole month of August, there is no new desks which was made, that head urged directors to make sure they complete the desks that are needed in their districts until August 30th this year.
Previously when reading messages to the head of the province, the Coordinator of Pan African Development Program, Stephen Mnyama said that the donation of those 42 motorbikes in this second phase will make a total of 137 motorcycles which have been issued to the coordinators of the ward and education officers of the district.
Together with those motorbikes, the program will also cater for 75 million shillings per month and will cater for its renovations, the aim being to enable the coordinators to arrive at the school areas and to make inspection and management of the school development in their wards.
One of the teachers who received motorcycle riders, Jovina Njekela said that the donation of that motorcycle will help its work performance because before yesterday walked a distance of 60 kilometers to inspect the schools from the ward office.
