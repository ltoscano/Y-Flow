Two opposition members of parliament have condemned the free commission of elections and borders (IEBC) by starting to register voters without stopping the public.
The Member of Parliament of Muhanga, Mister James Kobello and his fellow member of East Africa Mister Shakira Baamar said the registration of the voters do not depend on secret as the IEBC indicated, but need special preparations for the public to be able to participate.
Mister Koyi said that when the members of parliament did not be informed about important activities like that.
The chairperson of the IEBC, Issack Hassan has already denied the claims of registration of voters.
He said that the activity is going on in all the 290 people in accordance with the laws that are facing the IEBC.
But Mister Koyi has criticized the IEBC by not involved leaders of parliament so that they can be able to serve the citizens about that activity.
"The commission did not allow a lot of money to inform the politicians that the registration are going on.
"It is true they did not announce or leave people but I have taken a responsibility of encouraging my people," said Mister Pengo MMG.
However, the nominated member of parliament for Kisangani region, Mister Olago Almas has defended the commission saying it was not a secret of running that registration.
He urged the Kenyans to understand that the commission is facing a shortage of money and he would not be able to announce that activity.
"As a parliament, we will realize that the IEBC indicated that it will enable it to work," said Mister Olago.
