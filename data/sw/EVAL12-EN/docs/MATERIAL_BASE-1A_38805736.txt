Zamaradi Kawawa was given the stomach, after visiting Bango Sangho of Bongo Film within a price.

Stakeholders, important stakeholders' Steps Entertainment 'have sent away the prices of their film from 3 million shillings to 162 shillings.

This means that he is a business person like he is Joseph Kabila of the Clouds FM, he is asking the money to sell the car as he decided to move forward and maybe the price of paying the artists that come the fiesta show.

Surprising thing, Zamaradi Kawawa said that he has gone to a poster that I would like to believe by 'father'. This issue has changed a big topic on Clouds FM when he knows how they are looking for their interests but if it is just like the artists that increase the stage of fiesta 'by one hundred and then he is making it to use them.

He has written about an extent of breaking up for BASATA for they do not have assistance, they will do what to do, they will give you a chance to enable you to make it without any worry, today, you know the importance of BASATA!

Zamaradi Kawawa with your people I urge him to make noise, you want him to do his business as Luvanda, and has not completed any other law, it is a very good tax than companies from the pocket.

Secondly, there's no film for representing us to pay shillings 3 hundred thousand shillings, and I wish you so much for those films to have quality standards even to pay for one thousand shillings.

Zamaradi I advise you to stop noise, in charge if you want to get in this business well.
