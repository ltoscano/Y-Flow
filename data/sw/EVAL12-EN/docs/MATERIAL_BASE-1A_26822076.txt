Sun is supposed to join NSSF.
Kenyans who do work in the solar energy sector have been urged to invest more through voluntary payment systems (NSSF) for their future lives.
The Executive Manager of the Public Service Authority (RTO) Charles Machira yesterday said that employees in the informal sectors will be required to contribute to an amount of 200 million shillings every month.
Speaking to the employers of various organizations in Nairobi in a debate that was organized by the company to provide health insurance services, Mister Meng said that solar energy to join NSSF together with other workers in the official sector will not be able to give their contributions but they will do so through voluntary.
"The other employees who have been employed by various organizations including teachers is a must they give their contributions to 6 percent every month at the NSSF stand," said Mister Pengo.
The tent of the NSSF of 2013 was called to be the law by President Uhuru Kenyatta on December 27, last year, and was followed up to start being implemented from January 2014.
However, Minister of Leba, Kazuka, was postponed the implementation of that law up to June where it is expected to start being implemented officially.
