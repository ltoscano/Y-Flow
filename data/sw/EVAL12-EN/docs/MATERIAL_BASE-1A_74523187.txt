Baraza Ditto and Diamond should meet to discuss issues that affect our country.
Kenya is eternal peace, Eliona.
It will be a stable issue to the leaders of Geology and Diamond Jubilee in meeting and discussing with a good issues that are facing this country.
The position of President Uhuru Kenyatta to pay the proposal of the leaders of Correa scored by Moses Way, had been able to meet and look into a goalless draw.
I thank President Kenyatta to take a different position with his assistant, Mister William Ruto, who answered me without informing the fans of Diamond Jubilee Hall that he will meet with Cord.
It is clear that Mister Kenyatta used wisdom to say that he will have a meeting with those opposition leaders to exchange ideas on how it continues.
I congratulate Mister Kenyatta for that step and I urge him to thank her patriotism in meeting with the leaders then they will agree to be announced that he will be announced to be announced.
The truth is that Kenya is our we all of us and these things were affected and there is no safe.
