Dar es Salaam Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (Rwasa), Joel Lugua, has said that the authority has given more water services to 2000 customers who failed to pay for water catchment areas in accordance with Lugua, but the cost of running that authority has increased.

Lugiko said this yesterday at a water stakeholders' meeting in Kahama town that was with the aim of discussing how to put new boundaries in Nyansalwa Primary School due to some citizens invading the reserve area.
That manager has said that the authority cannot pay compensation to the citizens who have flooded the park, because for now it does not have money even to use a water pipeline from one kilometers to the new customer.
However, that manager said that the government is being requested for money to pay compensation to those citizens, are not reported not in the ones that are not registered quickly without any conditions.
I am not ready to look for money to pay compensation to the citizens who have conflicts in the dam area located in Nyamiyaga area, but my authority together with the council continue to control the area that has not been attacked by citizens by putting new boundaries, "he said.
The chairman of the Council of Kahama Town, Ayoub Shija said his council is not supposed to pay compensation to any citizen who cared for the house within the reserve area and added that those citizens who put up by mistake are supposed to get out of them.
