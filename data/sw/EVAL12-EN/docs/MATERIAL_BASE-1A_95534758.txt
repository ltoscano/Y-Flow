A budget changed, it does not have a normal citizen.
Before you be read for this year's budget, normal citizens had great hopes that the government would have for them the cost of life that is continuing to rise up every day.
As they expected to be the Minister of Finance, Henry Massao has reduced the price of basically such as flour, sugar, oil for cooking oil and other important services, but their hope that the step will attract economic growth and therefore be able to benefit the citizen.
On the eyes of the resident of the estate in the area of Aaron Nanyaro, in Nairobi, or his fellow reporter of Minara village, he from Turner, a budget that doesn't increase the price of water is not a budget.
The Kenyans do not affect the cost of life by using food prices as a criterion.
I agree with these citizens because, for example, last year the government was built almost 16 billion shillings to cater for the project of man's normal farms with an aim of strengthening food plants, but many areas in the country are still being faced with the bar of hunger.
Listen to me, President Uhuru Kenyatta launched a big project of man's actor of Galinoma who was expected to produce 10 million euros for a year but up to now the Kenyans have no information about the steps that were carried out by that aim.
Instead, recently the Prime Minister Felix Kona was told the Kenyans that the nation is faced with a shortage of 720,000 tons of maize while he from 23 were affected by the bar of hunger.
A situation is so bad in Mkonga and Turnbull.
On that foundation, I believe that Sh195 have been built for agriculture and is moisture that will change the bad state and a shame to the nation that got its freedom more than 50 years ago.
The government is very important to make sure that the budget of this year will bring the Kenyans into the threats of hunger and the high prices of food.
, you shouldn't give me a lesson.
