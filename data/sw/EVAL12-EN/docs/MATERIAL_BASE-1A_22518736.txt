How do I register myself to vote in Tanzania's tourist attractions.

By Neema Kalen.

The Tanzania Tourist Board (TTB), has made a call to civil servants who have not yet been forced to vote in Tanzanian attractions at the seventh round of the world in Africa, to do that early before December 31st this year.
The report given to the press and the director of TTB, Doctor Aloyce Nzuki, said the competition started on August this year.

He said the attractions that were in the competition are Mount Kilimanjaro, Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Serengeti National Park, "a total of 12 attractions available in the African continent have been put in this competition, Tanzania is the only country with many attractions in the list of all countries including Uganda and Kenya," he said.

He added that TTB is educating all the participants to win the tourist attractions because the remaining days are few.
