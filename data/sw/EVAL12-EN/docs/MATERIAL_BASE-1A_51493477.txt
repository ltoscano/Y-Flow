Moshi. The family of the late Simon Mbambo has presented a request to the court of wanting directors of Maranga & Company (T) who are arrested and killed by prisoners at the Karaga Maximum Prison.
In that request, the court has been requested to give an order to arrest him the councilor of a new town of Moshi town, Abu Shayo with his wife Mama Salma Kikwete and informing them when they have lost more than 45 million shillings.
Those funds are compensation that was given by the court on December 6th, 2012, for that family as a result of the death of Mbiso during the accident caused by the driver that was running a car for that company.
Since the resident magistrate of Kilimanjaro Province, Lugua Kasibu, released that judgment in the year 2012, that company has not paid the compensation or appeal against that judgment.
Through his lawyer Oscar Msechu, the family has opened a request to agree on that judgment as well as others, those directors are required to be shaken, he has said until when they will implement the court's order.
Those request started to be heard last week in front of the resident magistrate of Kilimanjaro Region, Joachim Paisano and plans on June 2, this year as the day of giving a decision.
Before going to that decision, magistrate Tigo Company has urged the responsibility of those applications to be supported by the appellant, Maranga, to present the summary of the case on May 12th and candidates to present them on May 25th.
In the main case of the supervisor of inheritance, Lucas Mbaki complained that the accident that took the life of their brother that happened on September 6, 2009 has been caused by the laziness of the driver, Gulam Mark, the real meaning of the company running a total of 52,589.
