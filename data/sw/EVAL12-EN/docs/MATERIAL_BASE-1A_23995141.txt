You will give him a chance recently, all of them see the importance of issues like this.
I started with talking about it.
Now I use my time to say the Swahili is what I wrote.

And we are continuing to stand there and encourage us that a Swahili does not depend on ways of ensuring our Swahili does not like a factory that is hard to make sure that the Swahili is crossing borders.
If there are countries going to my children, now we want to have a Swahili of Swahili and it is independent in fighting any goal and hypocrisy when we think they should stop under the anthill.
