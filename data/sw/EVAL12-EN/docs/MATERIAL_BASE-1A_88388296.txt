I was surprised by Wama, APR, 2016.

CHADEMA did not depend on your party.

The success of success does not have an additional way, if there is regulations then it is a must to follow me and if it is a long way then it is a must to change some issues if they still have an intention to hold 3 days in the coming days.
This party for the recent years is the opposition party that has shown that having a life, this is a party that has managed to fulfill several issues in this party and I have not noticed that this party still has a job to make corrections before holding the authority.
The party is like a child, who is born in the country, will not stop and at the end of the village, our country is very big and if you look for a good results from the level, this party has not succeeded to get members from the village level and to be given a good results from the party and to be proud because of being proud of the number of members who have in a certain area.
We saw in the previous election, Chama Cha Mapinduzi has not proud of the capital of party members and that's why it was difficult to convince some people that parliament won because they had a great reception of the party, where the campaign is dominated by entertainment as music and the music is hard to say it's something especially the citizens opposed the campaign or entertainment.
The elections done by politics we have said at the end of one election, it is the beginning of another election because we think it is a time for the first time now I think that we have been set aside, but we will make sure that we have been set aside, but we will make sure that the party is ongoing in town where they will decide the party to be held in town.
