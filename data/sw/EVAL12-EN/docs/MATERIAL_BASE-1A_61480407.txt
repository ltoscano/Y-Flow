TRA appears on the red carpet, Anna Tibaijuka, when she gets 500 million shillings from the distribution of Escrow account.

TRA has blamed Professor Tibaijuka to pay more than 500 million shillings from a share of 1200 billion shillings that are being related to money that had flown from Tegeta Escrow account.

He has opposed the claims by the appeal against TRA to oppose that amount of taxes, they have never received those funds from James Silas.

It is alleged that Professor Tibaijuka was removed from his position by the Minister of Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development from that scandal, given those funds on her account and James Silas.

As a result of that share, December 31st, 2015, TRA wanted to pay that tax, after failing to make corrections on that share.
