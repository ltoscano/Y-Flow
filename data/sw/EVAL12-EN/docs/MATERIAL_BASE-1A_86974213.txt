Do not depend on the authority of President John Pombe Magufuli in order to create political leaders of Tanzania.

This issue could have collaborated with TAKUKURU to be defeated and five leaders, all of the high level, I am looking at a different style.

President has given a statement by that order, there is no travel outside the country to save good money.

Those are four directors of directors who had a work tour.

As it was on the procedure they made a permit for the managing director of TAKUKURU, for the first offense and then went to the State House to ask for a permit, they were born.

After that, it was unable to understand that their executive director still wants to travel out of the country because this action can be interpreted as required by the authority of the president who has contributed a statement of preventing those trips.

Likewise, for the ordinary citizens, it has given a picture of other leaders in the government because they have contributed to the legality of their issues on personal benefits and experience of violating the authority that ended up on them.

There is no easy language, they do not forget where you are doing?

Now it is found.
