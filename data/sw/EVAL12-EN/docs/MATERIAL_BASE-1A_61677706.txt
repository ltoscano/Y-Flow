Good news,! Is Bongo Fleva star in collaboration with producer.

Good news, I would like to inform you this is this about the Bongo Flavor artist from Tip Top Connection, Tunda Man has said he has already done talks with the Congo artists artist, Fally Ipupa from their collaboration.

While speaking to Millardayo, he said that 'Siri ya Mtungi' has told him that she wants 1000 dollars which was surprised by him so that I can do with him last year I think that when I'm with him, he told me when I am just when I think it's just when I think it.

In the end of last year, Babu Tale wrote a song and said that it cannot go to January this he will not have a voice so that he can get the beat, I think that we have lost the beat, I would have used the beat, then we will use her to 1000 US dollars, Tunda Man.
