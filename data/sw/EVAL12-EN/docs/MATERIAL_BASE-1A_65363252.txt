The bomb came out and shot down, how do we do?
APR of September, 2015.

After events of last week at the University of MOI, Garbo passed away in Kenya and the ones that took place in Tanga, it is clear that terrorism is not a threat in our area.
Basically, since after events of a terrorist attack in the American ambassador in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998, our country has not been safe and attacks on the way, even if our neighborhood has been bad.
And because the government has been announced that the provinces of Mwanza and Dar es Salaam is in danger of those attacks, it is important now to take all actions of preventing disasters, and God bless you, like which is emanating from what is needed.
Open issue that we saw is that many citizens do not have enough understanding about how to dodge the terrorism disaster.
Still there is no need to come out where there is a dangerous incident that happened. For example, a bomb came into a place, a few minutes later we will see citizens have gone to view.
It has come at a time when the government is required to provide education to the public about what to do when a terrorist problem or some of the possibility of a terrorist attack.
That people should be told a habit of looking at areas with big gatherings when there is a threat to terrorism if the people should not be told about the danger areas where it is seen that terrorism can arise.
The citizens are now required to do what they were affected by people with weapons and they are required to fulfill the reports that are there and how these things are things that we think citizens are required to understand them.
It is common for countries that are developed countries that are faced with the two weeks time to see the small businesses that are under the desks or high level when the symptoms of the couple.
