Azam FC - the project will not be shaken.

I don't have a desire to follow up closely the matches of the Tanzania Mainland Premier League for several years now, I remember since the era of the Tanzanian soccer club in the end of 1980, Simba and African Sports of Tanga, Majimaji, Songea, Mbeya, Majimaji, Morogoro, Morogoro, Morogoro, Morogoro, Morogoro, Morogoro, Morogoro, Morogoro, Morogoro, Morogoro, Morogoro, Morogoro, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Shinyanga, Mbeya,

Since little, I was not a pursuer of our soccer but they emerged with Azam FC, it has given you the right to put my car in our soccer, but if we believe it for 20 years ago, our nation has never got married and since he went to him until today we should return to him.

Marcio Maximo, he has returned again to the Bongo soccer club and now it is not the coach of the national team but it is the coach of Yanga Club of Dar es Salaam, since he released his team's quality, especially about two players from Brazil so that Marcio Maximo has come from with them because of the two players from Brazil.

Finally, the special contest for the opening match of the Mainland Tanzania Mainland Premier League was held yesterday, Yanga played with Azam FC a match that people were not involved in the team and even the type of investment between Yanga and Azam FC in this match, Yanga defeated Azam 3-0 goals.

Private, this match has touched me in addition, there are a lot of challenges in operations and management of Azam FC, I have a lot of good people to manage this team as I don't know because this team has had a lot of long time but it has not been seen in their match with Yanga.

Azam team has participated in the CECAFA competition and it did not play in the best level that will fight the weight and quality environment of this team and also even how this team will be released as usual for our teams to be released every year in the previous steps.

In my vision, I think this project of Azam FC does not need experts from outside our country and it is clear that we will continue to build football and those who call him, "there is my personal journey to be like Yanga and Simba soccer stakeholders.

At the end, it is clear that this season for Yanga will be very good because it is under Coach Marcio Maximo, the person who can be remembered because Yanga's leadership seems to be used because Yanga's leadership should be allowed to continue, that is to look for success through the same way.

When I visit by saying, Miss Azam FC seems to be a project of losing direction since if you check the teams that are successful in Africa like TP Mazembe, Al Ahly, Zamalek, Solo, and Mujahideen, and all of African experts want to get experts from there than the truth.
