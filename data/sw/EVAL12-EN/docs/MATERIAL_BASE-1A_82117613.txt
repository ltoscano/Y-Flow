For a letter to wait for the 100 years?
Editor, I have been shocked by the reports that we the residents of Dodoma will be forced to wait for 100 years to get aroused.
This is a joke to you that you cannot believe that after 100 years the ones that will get the road.
I was expecting to hear our country very happy that after 100 years we have been encouraged to hear that within 100 years the issue of roads will still be priority, this is dangerous that our journey in the long development are still ongoing.
The government has prepared for a short time to make sure that during the 25 years, all the roads will be used in tarmac roads, many more than 100 years.
The construction of a road to wait for 100 years is dangerous for the development of the nation, John Mushi.
