I write this today being approximately second weeks work of Tabata Kimanga area, there were the congestion of goods, especially the ones that are close to the road.
What there is a procedure of collecting money getting once for a week and a car to carry itself has caused by taking them from this procedure was very good.
But for more than two months now, it has been not true again and now the residents of this province have been forced to live and get out of the doors.
The vehicle of collecting rubbish was very close to, they do not look into the residents of here and waiting for those who are pleased in the estates where the vehicle broke out in the house in front.
