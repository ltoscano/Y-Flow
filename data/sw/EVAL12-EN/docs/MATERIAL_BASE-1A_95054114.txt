What's surprising thing is that all the close things that are present in the "

The fourth promise of a man in the world says, "bribery is the right to Sitalike county, to receive or give bribery," look like what happened in all the elections of CCM and other positions within the party.

The next five promise was saying, "one is a bond, I will use my position or another person for my benefit," there are many complaints, especially in the election of the youth community of CCM that there are leaders who used their positions and therefore they want to win that election so that they want to win that election.

The chairman of CCM, Jakaya Kikwete has admitted the problem of the party being marred by bribery in its elections and not a solution, he has admitted also the existence of groups at the year 2015 and those groups are going on against the seven colleagues to build our country.
