The Party for Democracy and Development (CHADEMA) has said that from now it will not give them sweating from CCM that is sent in the purpose of disrupting that party.

The statement was made today afternoon by the National Chairman of CHADEMA, Freeman Mbowe, when he was speaking to members and party members of that party at the launch of the leadership council of the Southern Highlands Region.

Mister.
Mbowe has said that the modem is allowed to disrupt the opposition because it does not have a chance in that party for now and that the party will not continue honoring him or receive them sweating.

He has said that CHADEMA will not receive them sweating as giving a warning to the leaders that are in that party not to put many private interests instead of interests of the country, it has caused many political conflicts inside the opposition parties which is caused by paying for political parties and integrity whose intention is to make conflicts in all the affected and the citizens.

He has emphasized that as the chairman of the National Association he will not accept to see that situation because the cost of getting the honor of the party can be able to take up to 208 due to the public, a situation that will take a long time to return his honor.
