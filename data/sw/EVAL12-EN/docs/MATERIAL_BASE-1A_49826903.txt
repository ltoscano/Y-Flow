The ban of Mo Blog is still there.
By Mike Pence.
The ban that was taken against corruption, and the use of foods that are outdated, is where he is up to when a panel that was appointed by the Ministry of Health to provide information about the case, Minister James Kilaba said yesterday.
Speaking to the nation today, Mister Macharia Irungu said that the commission led by Professor Kihesa, will organize meetings from the public all over the country for 20 days before being prepared a report that will give direction on that issue.
The ban against the MO Blog is still there, because it was given through the directive of the ministers or not in the Ministry of Health.
"My ministry is still going on to begin the public meetings before preparing a report about that issue," Gabo has added.
