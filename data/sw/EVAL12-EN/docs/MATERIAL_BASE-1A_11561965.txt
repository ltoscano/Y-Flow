The judge of parliament has been known as a trap of discussing an important argument that affects the supply of money from the local government.
The Spokesperson of the Senate's parliamentary speaker, Pristure, through the official newspaper of the government said that it will start their sessions on September 2nd and to agree on the renovations that were carried out by the national parliament on August 19 this year.
That issue has been explained the way he bought all 47 students that will pay the money set aside by non-governmental organizations (Corefa).
Members of parliament have reduced the time of starting the use of that law from 14 to 7 days just, it will be correct that the president Uhuru Kenyatta said that those changes will be discussed by the Senate that they agree or not them.
However, the chairperson of Finance committee, Mister Bilame Nyanduga, said there was no need to return the Senate's motion because a lot of time made by the law is being supported.
