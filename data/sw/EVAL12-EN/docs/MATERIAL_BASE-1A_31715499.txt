The government depends on parole.
The series of brutal killings in possession of Lamu Lamu Island is dangerous and time has come for senior leaders in the government to take action.
It is last month where more than 60 people were killed and yesterday more than 20 people were killed ruthlessly.
No reason is that after the killing of last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta, the Minister for Security Joseph Lessly Nyami and the police commissioner David Kimaichako said that security had gone down and that there was no reason for fear to continue living in those areas.
However, before the end of last month, the killings have taken place where the government will now know what the residents of those who lost family and friends.
In Mombasa, the tourist from Russia was killed by being shot, an incident that can involve the few tourists who had the courage to visit Kenya even after a stern warning, now usually comes with Kenya.
Yesterday, the Deputy President, William Ruto, had areas that were affected and wanted security officers to follow the involved and promised that stern action would have been taken.
This has been a song every disaster led to it, the truth is that, these events are signs of increasing at work and not to be responsible among the concerned officers.
Although the government has condemned politicians and illegal groups, the truth is that the only government is with power to control those politicians or groups.
While it has come for these officers, and their heads to be taken against them and they would like to see and allow security to enhance security.
This will not happen, the country will continue to get economic and citizens who are not guilty of losing life.
It will be difficult to convince the tourists to visit the Coastal areas which depend on so much tourism, let us continue to invest in areas that are seen not to be safe.
