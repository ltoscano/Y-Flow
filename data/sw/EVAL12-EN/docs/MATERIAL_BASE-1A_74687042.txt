Dar es Salaam was happy about the employees of the Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (PAYE), from 11 to 9 percent, it can be permanent for a short time after experts claimed that it amounts to approximately 600 million shillings and 3,200 shillings.
According to the system that is being used in paying that tax, the employees of the least being from 250,000 shillings will get affordable to 600 million shillings, while those salaries start from 3300,000 shillings, they will get an affordable cost of 200 shillings.
The payment of salaries that has talked to Mwananchi yesterday about the meaning of the reduction, he said that the level of tax collection shows that there will be an affordable cost after the reduction of tax exemptions.
He has been over 11 percent of the salary tax that remain after depending on the contribution of the community fund, which are 155,667 same as 7100 shillings of his salary.
That employee asking for 1 million shillings, he started being 9 percent of the tax tax on July first this year, when he will receive 77,300 shillings instead of 7100 shillings they received now.
He said that means that it started being 9 percent of more than 1 million shillings, it will contribute 1000 shillings while it continues to contribute 100,000 shillings which is 10 percent of his salary he has contributed to the community fund.
He said that it means after concluding those accusations, he will receive 77,300 shillings instead of 7100 shillings that he got previously when he was approximately 11 percent.
On that meaning, the difference between paying tax (PAYE) from a reduction of 11 percent up to 9 percent of an employee waiting for 1 million shillings per month, 2800 shillings.
For the workers the ones who are paid the salary of $250,000 to 1000 shillings per month, different from the occurrence of tax tax from the 11 percent reduction from 9 percent, it is 1,100 shillings.
That has a meaning that if his salary is 20,000 shillings, after falling on 11 percent of the tax tax (50) and 10 percent of the contribution of the Social Security Fund (EFD), he was carrying 276 billion shillings.
But he will start being paid 9 percent of the salary tax which is 4950 percent and 10 percent of the income to the community fund which is 20,000 shillings.
