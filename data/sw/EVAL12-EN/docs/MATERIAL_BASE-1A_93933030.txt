He has urged the office to ensure that every department will have the servants in implementing duties of the department in Pemba Island so that there should be the right ratio in the implementation of the manifesto of Zanzibar and Pemba.
Doctor Shein wanted the directors of parliament to deal with the State House with a lot of ways and easy to communicate with the citizens so as to unite with the government.
Doctor Shein said that together with the good work done by giving citizens the information about the government's activities on various communication activities, there is a need to create a easy way that will go through communication between the government and its citizens.
