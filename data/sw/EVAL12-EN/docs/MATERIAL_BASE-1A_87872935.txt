Kikwete and a special donation from China, January 17, 2014.

In today's world, the cooperation between one country and the other is important to be supported, it should be a partnership between the economic and culture sector.
It is in that foundation, among things that are forced to bring about many questions is the recent decision of President Jakaya Kikwete for support of China experts through the minister of housing, housing and development of China, Peter Jiang.
He has asked the experts of urban planning to come and go as some of our towns of Tanzania, President Kikwete has given those applications while his government has self-employed if not tens of urban planning officers from the district level and provinces.
Apart from employ, many experts have benefited from several countries in the world for the training tour, including the training of planning the towns.
Employment and their journey of training have cost a lot of money this country and in another reason, the nation was required and it continues to make sure that they will stop the problems of soccer.
We wish you a lot of questions from the decision of President Kikwete to request for support by specialists from the towns of China.
When we ask for those questions, we know the truth that between the sectors that are running the country is together with the urban planning, where bribery was a solution for a short time, and the permanent solution is to clean the effects of bribery in that sector and another loss.
Therefore, when you wait for the Chinese help to plan our towns.
