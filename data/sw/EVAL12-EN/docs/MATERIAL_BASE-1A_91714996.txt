Small elections and cut off the picture of CCM.
Brightiles 21, 2013.

Earlier this year I have written the articles to shrink in CCM and grow to CHADEMA, but with a small speed of politicians who did not love this article on the offense of CCM, it was to show that CCM has risen up by three percent of the council as well as this party had given a victory of more than 75 percent.
On the side of CHADEMA, the offense of the article was to show that the growth of this party was small compared to the ones that were in the streets and that CHADEMA was going to win in a small elections for councilor and villages not to succeed in the streets about "loved" to this party.

In this article I come back to my opinion about continuing to shrink in CCM and grow to CHADEMA, by going back to CHADEMA, in a small election which was supervised by Mzee John Okello, popular in these days where the general supervisor of the small elections of CCM is a young man, life, and professionalism of power, Mwigulu Nchemba.
It will be remembered that the election that ended the day before yesterday is the second to take place in February this year and another election that was done in February following one year since the general elections started in the year 2010.
Now in the election that ended the day before yesterday, in 22 wards that were being competed for CCM and only one ward, the results show that CCM won in 16 wards and CHADEMA got a total of 1200 votes compared to CHADEMA, they have won a total of 1200 votes compared to CHADEMA, they have won a total of 1200 votes compared to CHADEMA, they have won a total of 1200 votes compared to CHADEMA, they have won a total of 1200 votes compared to CHADEMA, but they have won a total of 1200 votes compared to CHADEMA, they have won a total of 1200 votes compared to CHADEMA.
If you check the statistics of the results of the parliamentary elections recently, you will see that the ability of CCM was to be unable to break up with political parties in the country, will remember that during a short time, the party is expected to finish up and now the party is expected to take place where there is no one who wanted the way we saw in Ifakara Town.
