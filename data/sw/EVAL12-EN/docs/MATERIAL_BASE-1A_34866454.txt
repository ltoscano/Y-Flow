Before yesterday, it is that the government continues to give the heart to those citizens that security has been damaged by both sides in Lamu Island, Kenyans have the right to be careful.
The main government therefore, then it is to win with those officers who visit work especially those from the security unit.
Citizens in general they have a lot of pain so as the unit to address a security situation in the country directs.
At this time, it is not to answer a finger to blame to politicians because security is the responsibility of all the leaders in the main government.
It is their responsibility to cooperate so as to address this matter to emergency.
It is suitable for great strategies to be looked into so that this situation can be strengthen by a lasting solution.
