The former parliamentary candidate of Ubungo Plaza in Mwanza province, on the ticket of the Party of Democracy and Development (CHADEMA), in the general elections of 2010, Mister Uluguru Mwale, has joined the Revolutionary Party (CCM).
Speaking to journalists in Mwanza City yesterday before the secretary of CCM of Nyamagana District, Mister Deogratius Massawe, said he has decided to move from the party due to misuse of funds that are given by the government.

I commend his satisfaction with the use of this party which every month has got a grant of millions of money from a large number of members of parliament but they started the headquarters of the party in Dar es Salaam instead of going to the top level, "he said.

He added that the action is equal to steal citizens as those funds are supposed to be used in development activities for citizens and developing the party at different levels in the whole country.

Mister Chagaka Kalimbia said that CHADEMA has problems in its leadership system that is why its national leaders have been taking action without involved the high level.


The national chairperson of CHADEMA, Freeman Mbowe, earlier this year, the two councilors party members Mister Henry Matata, Kitwiru, Kitogo county and Mister Adam Kimbisa of the opposition party offices in the city without involved the party meetings in the concerned level, "said Mister Sangawe.

He said the situation shows that, how the party did, so that the leaders can be given an opportunity to hold the dollars because they can bring problems due to the decision of power.

He said the action of the secretary general of the party, Doctor Leonard Lutegama Maboko to own two cards for different political parties, one of CCM and CHADEMA, is showing the leaders of that party, it encourages them and that those weaknesses are enough for him.
