Resident magistrate court of Arusha and Arumeru district in this province, has thrown out the issues of defense lawyers of the case involving 13 employees of Barclays Bank, Arusha branch, to put an indication of refusing the documents to be one of the evidence in that case.

Last week, the lawyers opposed the gadgets to be received in the court on claims that they are involved in the law on claims that it is not allowed to be received as an illustration of that the ones that are required is not true.
While giving that decision, the Resident Judge in charge of that court, Deusdedit Kamugisha said the claims that were given by those lawyers are not the foundation because they are not involved but the real documents is supposed to be released and witness Fredrick Uo (43), to be the general manager of Barclays Bank, Arusha branch.
Kamugisha said the receipts which are given to the tourism company after paying the bank is legal and the ones that were presented to the Ngorongoro Conservation Authority (NCAA), in order to get services.
He said that those are legal measures for putting the bank but he refused the documents of giving out the bank and said that they were not real because of those inspected but the law on provision of documents to the court.
As a result of those decisions, those statements have been received and became one of the illustrations for the case and that case is expected to be mentioned again on October 7, this year and continued to be heard three days starting on October 10, 11, and 12 this year.
The application was handed over by Uo, who is the third witness in that case of theft of more than seven billion shillings and three accused in that case they are outside the case they are out of illegal drugs because that case is not beneficial in accordance with the law.
