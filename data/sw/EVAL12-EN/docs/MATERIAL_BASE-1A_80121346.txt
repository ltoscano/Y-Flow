Shamsa Ford, I request that if you go through Tetemesha Entertainment, if you get married, I don't have any value to you, I don't have any value for you and I don't know it.

I have love for every person without discrimination, I live my real life and I don't say God to each person, you are not involved with someone.

I request that you and you have a human being before you're holding on my life, remember I have a child who need life.

You are a human being before you missed a lot or any time I remember that I have a child who will be wrecking your mother and his joy is to see her mother.

You are a human being before wanting to remind me and asked me to give me a foolish thing, I request that you should stop my son who is self-reliance!

If you pay, I will fail to work with my son who cannot get his primary rights.

I request that you are a human being when you go through if you get married, if I don't have any value to you, I request it to listen to me more than me because you are in my own kind or for the purpose of your personal interests.
