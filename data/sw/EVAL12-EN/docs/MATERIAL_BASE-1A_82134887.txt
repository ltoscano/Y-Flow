Giggs is Karrima Carter?
The acting manager of Manchester United Club Ryan Giggs has the ability to make success equivalent to Pep Guardiola and Lennarth Hoja, when he was the coach of Barcelona, according to goalkeeper Andengeye.
"You may be seen as a foolish thing, but in my opinion, this is Pep Guardiola," Lerner has told BBC Sport.
"The ones that we saw in the first week have been very humiliating.
It is like a lot by Sir Alex Ferguson and it is clear that Ryan Giggs has learned a lot from one of the soccer coaches who were put on the end of last week after David Moyes was sacked for a period of six months after starting with Ferguson.
