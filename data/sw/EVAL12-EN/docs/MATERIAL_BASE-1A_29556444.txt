On Saturday the day before yesterday when I was in my heart in my house, they did not recognize that, she was my neighbor (a girl) he has years like 24-26, since I don't leave here, I don't jump and I don't have a lot of income or that goes up here in town, after welcoming him in the city he started.

(My name) of fish, I am happy, I wrote a ring on the sun, doughing, (his name), I have a problem to live in 30,000 / =, I request you to help him, (because I have never explained it).

There is not Mtwara Province, it is Doctor here the day before yesterday told me that "you will talk again from the previous day," said Mtwara province has a wife with 3 children.

He is saying (not Mtwara), he is the one who will give him a house of houses, she has landed in Hotel Management and she is the one who is affecting food because of food.

Now the tax is completed in the first month in the year and the university fees is alleged and it has improved 270,070,00 shillings per year at home in Zanzibar.

He told me that, when I have found an expert (surgeon), he told her to give him (30,000 / =) in order to restore communication and others will put him a lot of food or another to be given.

I was not happy and let me ask one question, why do you use a way of talks but he said they have not tried to do not like, "I'll remove it here when the fee is postponed, the tax payment is completed in the year"?

I gave birth to 30,000 / = shillings.

Therefore, men should be very careful with the residents of Mtwara because it is possible that you shouldn't know her, but your heart goes on suddenly and decided to continue with him up to now Sheke s should be very careful.
