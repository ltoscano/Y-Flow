Seif: Drugs is to remove the problems of the union on May 29, 2012.

"We are in CUF, we have explained openly that there is need to strengthen our union by checking the basis of our business people through the way of doing so, it is clear that all the three authorities are available in the union's agreement so as to eliminate the fear of thinking that we are involved in this structure and another as they are facing.
The government of Zanzibar did not openly say that the Tanganyika government are seen openly that there will be fear of getting a small table, something that is saying it continues to expand the image of the union of United Republic of Zanzibar and Zanzibar.
Apart from the issue of the structure of the union, many other areas that involve the union of the union was continuing with having a union of the United Republic and the Revolutionary Council, being cooperating with the National Council of Zanzibar, which will follow the laws of giving the members of parliament.
There is enough evidence that the Tanganyika Parliament met and ordered that agreement on April 25, there were no evidence that the Council of Revolution has been cooperating with the council of ministers of Zanzibar who sat at that agreement.
Therefore, the evidence was raised by Professor Issa Shivji in his very few book, Pan African Football Associations (Fathers - Tourism Board, has shown an open that the agreement has not been approved by Zanzibar's side until today.
"Article 5 (5) of the United Republic, has listed 11 things that were accepted by the United Republic of Zanzibar and the United Republic of Tanzania that these things have been revealed to ensure that every step of increasing the coalition government, which if we are not ready to show for sure especially in the Tanganyika government.
"Section of (Viate) of the agreement makes the president of the United Republic on talks and an agreement with the Vice President who is also the president of Zanzibar to form the constitutional constitution with the aim of helping those two leaders.
This very important step of constitutional process was to be discussed inside a period of one year from the United Republic of Tanzania that was made up of the purpose of passing the permanent constitution of the union that was held up of the purpose of passing the permanent constitution of the union that was held up of the purpose of passing the permanent constitution of the union that was held up by the purpose of passing the permanent constitution of the union that was held up by the purpose of passing the permanent constitution of the union that was held up by the purpose of passing the permanent constitution of the union that was held up with the purpose of passing the permanent constitution of the union that was held up by the purpose of passing the permanent constitution of the union that was held up by the purpose of passing the permanent constitution of the union that was held up by the purpose of passing the permanent constitution of the union that was held up by the purpose of passing the permanent constitution of the union that was held up by the purpose of passing the parliamentary constitution that was held up to today it is completely eradicated.
"But apart from switching off those weapons against the union's agreement, the biggest club that was used for the, Zanzibar was to be connected to the parties concerning any decisions in the country including the government and the council of representatives.
Under the concept of the party to rule was founded by the Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, it was able to give instructions by the government without caring about the party's power and therefore they should get all the ability to break the union because they are the structure of the union because of the problem of the union.
"The cause of the foundation of unity in the United Republic, which on the side of CUF, is its structure that comes from any other than 45 years in Zanzibar, what are increasing every time when we look at any other issues without being forced to get the consent of the second side whom it gets only.
If you look at details, you will discover that the problem is going back to the structure of Zanzibar, he didn't know the authority of the union in the coalition government regarding how the authorities of the United Republic of Tanzania are starting.
Tanganyika and "we did not like to him in the government of the union makes us to know" and where Zanzibar gets the authority to interview things that "we believe in everything that is called" the problem of the union.
These examples can be given by approximately all these things, but on the purpose of this document we take the examples of three things that sparked complaints, natural gas and natural gas, that brought to him in the level of the union and the representation of Zanzibar in the United Republic of Tanzania.
"First, to put him to him in the list of the United Republic (as it is for many things that have been added later), he didn't follow the procedures of the coalition government (which is also the Tanganyika government through the non-governmental organizations) to advise and get the consent of Zanzibar.
Secondly, Zanzibar wants to know if oil is supposed to be the issue of unity and therefore the income that will be available is right now, where other minerals that are found in mainland like gold, diamonds and Tanzanite didn't be done, whereby it is not a union of unity, its income should benefit Tanganyika alone, which are getting in a short system of use?
Third, if the income that will be used due to oil will go into the union fund, there is a lot of funds for the union activities and the non-governmental organizations that come from the union, that issue has also been caused by controversy.
So, when a person says that Zanzibar did not get the cost of operations and institutions of the union because it is not a government of the United Republic of Tanzania, because this government does not give a chance to have a lot of money that will be used by the United Government through the United Republic of Tanzania using its authority for the purpose?
The same way for the revenue collected from the union and institutions of the United Nations, we know Zanzibar gets its equal participation and that is not open (although it is not acceptable at the union) with many people more than Zanzibar, an issue that led to many people more than Zanzibar.
"Many Tanganyika citizens are complaining that Zanzibar is small and which is being represented by members of parliament to be represented by members of parliament of 50 years in Dar es Salaam with many citizens, has more than 7 members.
These members who are participating in all the parliamentary debates including non-governmental organizations (TCU) will be the Tanganyika authority on issues that are not supervised by the United Republic of Tanzania and they should not depend on those issues with the United Republic of Tanzania who are not supposed to participate in those issues with the United Republic of Tanzania.
"These examples are enough to show that close to all problems, like all, arising from the conflict of interests between the two sides that have been identified by a system that is not open concerning the state of Zanzibar in the country, especially from the recent statements about the status of Zanzibar in the country or not a country or not.
"After checking the cause of the union problems due to the structure of the union, now we look at the position of Zanzibar in this union, especially because of the Tanganyika politicians recently led by the Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda.
He said as a result of there to try to inform the existence of the union's agreement which is the main law (Monsigation) of the United Republic as the first constitution and therefore they will have a statement that following the step of joining Zanzibar, Zanzibar has lost their status and reputation of being the country.
Those who said recently are believed that Zanzibar has its constitution that has the same status and the constitution of the United Republic, and that all of them are supposed to communicate through the agreements of the union.
"The constitution of Zanzibar has clearly stated that Zanzibar is the former president of that constitution that explained the intention of people of Zanzibar who are the ones with the constitution (CCM) of the United Republic of Tanzania has noted that it is clear that the intention of Zanzibar to protect and maintain their country and all the ones that live in Zanzibar as a country.
In the previous place, can be easily read, "and because we are talking to appreciating the good revolutionary work that was done by the Revolutionary Party, led by the chairperson of Chama cha Mapinduzi (Revolution) of Zanzibar in the year 1995, and instead maintain Uhuru and Union, rights and gender, honor, and security.
"It is bad luck that some people have been looking at article 5 (1) of the Zanzibar constitution," said Zanzibar is part of the United Republic of Tanzania "for the meaning of being part of the United Republic of Tanzania" a meaning that for him to be part of the United Republic of Tanzania "a meaning that for him is part of the United Republic of Tanzania.
The way is not correct if it was reported by Judge Abdullahi Salfrom Nigeria, who was the chairperson of the Commission through Law and Human Rights Commission (Zanzibar), the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar assured Judge Zuckerberg has said in his report about article (1) of Zanzibar's first phase, in the first part of the constitution of Zanzibar.
"A person reading keenly, while in the general constitution in general, he will understand that Zanzibar is one of his full authority (yellow card) and that those who joined this constitution did not have the intention of reviewing and releasing the authority (Albino), who love the United Republic of Tanzania.
However, when a person reading one of the article (1) of a constitution when I'm surprised and surprised by what is the first one by Jihadists, (the crown) that had benefited or have risen to those authorities. "
"Judge Zille has continued to say that he believes that it is continuing to live a stern action taken to Zanzibar and Tanganyika as one Republic, who are not able to make sure that the step does not loose in any country among those two countries alongside the one of the union that will be born.
That expert told us that the legal way, "two rights meet inside one person, it is same to say that they are inside the same people," maybe I believe that they are faith in the good commission that it made up of the union, Zanzibar intended and insisted on how to promote its authority inside the union.
He explains that, as a result of this, we believe that the status of Zanzibar as it is explained in article (1) has been revealed because (section) was not enough for the constitution (time) and the power that were given by the people of Zanzibar.
However, maybe I go back very little, we should leave that the commission of representatives, which is the one that led the constitution in the year 1984, arising from the citizens and that the council is holding the authority such as security (Trust) on behalf of those citizens.
"Therefore, to be unable to supervise the government on the basis of the constitution is same as going against the security that they were given by people of Zanzibar," this is explained openly in section 9 of the Zanzibar constitution, "this is explained openly in section 9 of the country's constitution as the strength and all the ability of the government following the constitution will come out to citizens themselves."
If we continue with this argument, Judge Zuckerberg says that the explanation of article (1) of the constitution that is the first to intervene in the constitution itself, should give this explanation as going against the intention of the people of Zanzibar which is clear and put in place as the aim of the people of Zanzibar.
It is not known as we know, "Zanzibar is a must that it will be one of the authorities, and it will be part of the United Republic of Tanzania in accordance with the requirements and procedures that were mentioned in the union agreement between the United Republic of Zanzibar.
"With the purpose of more understanding, we will quote again with the English as he wrote him by the president of Zanzibar and the president of Zanzibar and the president of Zanzibar and the president of Zanzibar and the president of Zanzibar and the president of Zanzibar and the president of Zanzibar and the president of Zanzibar and the president of Zanzibar and the president of Zanzibar and the president of Zanzibar.
The recommendations of the commission of Judge Zille has been taken to the attorney general of Zanzibar on December 19, 2001, but up to today the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar has not completed any action of writing the constitution of Zanzibar and listen to the intentions of the citizens of Zanzibar.
