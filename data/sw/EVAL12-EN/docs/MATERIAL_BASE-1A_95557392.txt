By OMR.
Geneva, Switzerland, citizens yesterday to vote for the decision to decide if the low costs will be sold to 25 dollars for every time, which will be a high cost in the world.
Abiding by the proposal is that it is needed because of a huge cost of living in that country, although research shows that the government will not accept the payment of more than the level that can be as a manager for the first time in other nations.
The voters also were required to decide about the plan to buy fights that will cost billions from Sweden.
Many stations for voting are expected to be opened four o'clock in the morning and scored six o'clock in the morning, with the actual results expected to be few hours later.
However, it's a few who was expected to arrive at the stations because many of them continue to send their votes through office or internet.
That elections are organized every after three months as one of the ways of developing democracy in that country.
Many debates before the election came about it being taken to the payment of low payments.
If it will be called, those payments will be great than America, France and Spain.
Those who focus on that action are insisting that citizens need to be paid 25 dollars for one hour, or 715 million dollars per month so as to cater for the lives in that country, which is one of the ones that have a lot of life in the world.
