This is the MSG I send a Tanzanian that he was defeated in Angola.

Some of the brothers and friends of a Tanzanian who was sentenced to eight years in Angola after being found with drugs that he used to travel to South Africa has ever been forced to ask for the support of the government so that their brother can be locked in prison in Tanzania.

Khaleed Ramadhan Abdullah has said that this Tanzanian left South Africa to go according to the drugs that Brazil and he succeeded to take, but when he will be back in South Africa to change that plane that was arrested and found with drugs for three years ago.

In the whole period, the relatives have been playing in Angola without knowing his fate and even being unable to meet with the ambassador of Tanzania Angola, but two weeks ago has been sentenced to 8 years ago.

The request that was accompanied by these brothers to speak, is to request the government to help this person to meet with the ambassador to there so that the procedure to come to Tanzania be known.

Many times, this Tanzanian has been sent away by using a phone of other people he met with them in prison.
