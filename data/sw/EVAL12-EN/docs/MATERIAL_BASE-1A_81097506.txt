The institution for preventing and fighting corruption (flyover) has been running training for various public institutions in the country concerning the law on the elections' expenditure, recently.
Basically the training aims to prevent and dealing with giving and receiving bribes during elections, if we start with the general elections this year.
In the normal state, maybe there would be no need for this education that is given now by TAKUKURU in because the public is expected to have know the boundaries for the election exercise.
Real situation, even so, it shows that this is a law which many stakeholders, including those who missed them, and sure that these things are doing so that many of them are going on things like it's not present.
All of us have only witnesses for how presidential candidates for different election positions and even those who are still in their positions are continuing to be involved in actions which essentially has been done by this law.
In short, the actions that we see now, immediately you gave out a donation of motorbikes, immediately you have made a community service to talk about the development of the country or the province in this period, these are things that cause the law.
We get advice that TAKUKURU is saying that you are following up these actions in the country and that his commanders have a order to make sure they take over the record, the other through the electronic system, so as to get the suspects, they should be taken to the law.
We know that by starting this year, this law should not affect people involved in actions that are going against this law.
Our expectations is that after the election of this year we will also prepared himself well to meet the requirements of the law to sign up leadership that it is taken by the people that are involved with bribery.
