Speaker of EALA.
By Benedict Liwenga.
The speaker of the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA), late Margaret Nito Ziba, got a decision after the East African court made a decision to prevent some of the members of parliament of that parliament to destroy the office.
Already the members of parliament have agreed on the argument of removing the speaker for the secretary of EALA with the right of the CCM members with the right to fulfill the requirements of the procedure that is required according to the regulations of former speaker.
The court ordered Miss Zeco centers to take place from office up to May 29 when it will address his case.
Those members of parliament are accused of being unable to implement its responsibilities and use the chest to run the parliamentary activities.
Miss Ziba, who is the Ugandan citizen, who had been condemned by members of parliament for lack of talks and before taking important decisions to the lawyers of the East African Community has been accused and added that the parliament's supposed to continue with its normal activities without passing through that case.
