The prosecution in the case to join the use of weapons and destruction of goods valued at 500 million shillings from the Lutheran Evangelistic Church of Tanzania (KKKT) of Mbagala, in Dar es Salaam city has claimed that the investigation of the case is complete.
The government lawyer, Tumaini Kweka, gave the statement at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate Court in front of Judge Aloyce Katanga, when the case was not mentioned.

Lawyer Kweka asked the court to mention the court on behalf of being involved in the previous reports which was scheduled on December 24th, this year, while he requested the court to move to the scene so that those suspects are supposed to be served.

In another step, the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) has criticized the six judges of that case by using the authority that was given to him and added other five accused.
