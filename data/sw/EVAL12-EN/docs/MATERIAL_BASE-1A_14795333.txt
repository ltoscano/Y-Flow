Chalinze primary school, an elderly in Bagamoyo district in Pwani province is facing various challenges including a huge shortage of desks together with the university on the side of students, while they arrested them being faced with a lot of lack of lack of flowers when they clarified.
The party of I have did not like my colleagues to witness some of the students seated on the class due to lack of desks in the class due to lack of desks in a step that the teachers concerned has said due to students failing to perform well in secondary schools by the concerned teachers.

Apart, Mayalla Mayalla one of the teachers in that primary school of Chalinze, while clarifying more in the environment of Congo.
There is a problem.

Friends.
The problem of lack of water shortage in that school has four hundred and old students, it has also been reported that causing the disturbance of a long time because others do not have shoes like the way they are able to help each other children.
We are together with the shoes up to others who are books we will help them and agree with them and others are the ones continuing to go up to secondary but in checking the environment that we had to have.
By using me and something with the teachers even so that a non-governmental organization for the high table that deals with social services in Bagamoyo district has succeeded in construction of toilets with ten thousand shillings and a total of twenty million shillings.
That you can be seen in many schools, the old man is one of the ones that we are selling but I tell me the budget to recognize it is better for every Tanzanian shillings a report from every primary school's effort in order to avoid the young people.
