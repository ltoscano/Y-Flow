It's not good to be an old man Petro a is saying.
December 23, 2014.

Mzee Petro, a resident of the ruling party, CCM, is also the sponsor of that party that deals with our government and therefore it is a person with great honor in and out of the party, therefore, it is a person who had a great honor in the community that caused a culture of honor them.

According to those reasons, it's not good to listen to the elder of an entrepreneur, Joseph Sinde Warioba, who has been leading, as the chairperson, commission of president's commission known as G-55, which were satisfied with the presence of three government structure in the United Republic of Tanzania.

It's not good because it is not true that Judge Warioba has never been one of the G - 55 years to come and be in Parliament that time, 20 years ago in Bunda Town, the ones that were in that group are ready to meet with them at his home, Msasani.

Those sessions were flooded because of those leaders and the teacher who was about the concept of three governments, Doctor Warioba also visited those sessions but he was not the side of G - 55, and even immediately they did not support the position of the group.

That is a must that his reasons for refusing to reject the system of three governments without changing in this issue or not, if most of the members of CCM are supposed to do their thoughts and others do not have their contribution and therefore he was able to kill them as he wanted.

We have benefited from if you had decided to look for a little time and that's why I don't like that, the elder Aboud Jumbe who led the Constitution commission that proposed the structure of three governments or Judge Robert Latonga who led that constitution.

It's not good, an old man says that you are false because of any reason.
