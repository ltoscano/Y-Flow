The reason being brought to the city of Dar es Salaam being the increase of people.
First, for my love and think about a big issue in education is about.
If you check compared to other provinces.
Education that has been released while you will not be enough, there are many things and also many secondary schools where most of the students who come from the provinces are coming here in Dar es Salaam.
But the infrastructure should remain like the work of Dar es Salaam.
Compared to the sectors that are there for the citizens in general.
There are no changes that development are increasing or a billion is reduced.
You have tried to look for.
Development is evident that as it is increasing in education terms, but the education part in education that children in the education institutions maybe if you get something that is being taken by the government at a large numbers to be taken by the government at a total of production so as to increase the increase.
Consider with how people do not live that maybe in their homes.
.
But by love, when you see here, the government about the residence of the residence is still seen very well compared to it.
He added that I have been able to see that the government would be a speaker that it was there and that your development is equal to all those who are.
The income of low-income.
At least the government at least there is the small one that maybe the government is giving plots.
Grounds that are people.
They are coming.
All the officers, I would like to know his legacy of the people that use it below and because of those fields, if people can decide all of this blog, I put him up until today, for sure that she is in to reduce that of people in one area because most of the people participated in this area.
