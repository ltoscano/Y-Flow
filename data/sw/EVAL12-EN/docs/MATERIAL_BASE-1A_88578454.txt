The embassy of Japan in the country, has said that it will continue to cooperate with the government of Tanzania to ensure children are stuck because of secondary education due to the small capacity of parents and guardians who get the opportunity to continue with their studies.

That was said yesterday by the ambassador of Japan in the country, Masaharu Yoshiba during the tour of Sawazisha 'school, Arumeru district in Arusha province, which accompanied the launch of the fence of that school.
Ambassador Yoshiba said that they will continue to cooperate with the government of Tanzania in ensuring that children do not have the ability to develop their ability, give them their basic right of getting education for their own benefit.
The director of that school, Francis ida Tena has thanked those sponsors for building that fence at a cost of 795,739 million shillings which will help the students to be safe.
He said that there is a challenge that is facing lack of visas for the teachers who come from foreign countries who are teaching to school and it's difficult for them to participate fully as a result of that challenge.
When we ask those students, to study hard and take them more in science subjects since the country goes through a revolution in those industries that are needed most of the scholars.
The retired Ambassador of Tanzania in Japan, Doctor Batshuayi said that despite the efforts of stakeholders in improving education in the country, there is still a big challenge to bureaucracy in the availability of a diploma for teachers who are in the country to teach them, therefore it is good for that issue.
The student Sharon Tom, thanked the embassy, how it has been able to get education from their parents not to have the ability to improve education in education.
