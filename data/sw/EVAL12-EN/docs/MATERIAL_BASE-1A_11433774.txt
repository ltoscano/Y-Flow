Residents of Kahama District, Shinyanga province, especially the youth have been urged to take advantage of business opportunities that will take place during the construction of a oil pipeline from Hoya, Uganda to the port of Tanga, where they go in that district.

The District Commissioner of Kahama district, Fadhili Matina Nkurlu said that while speaking to the councilors of the council of Msepwa in a special session of the council of councilors which took place at the end of last week.
Matina said that the oil pipeline that will be built, will arrive in the Kahama district and therefore urged the youths to take advantage of the opportunities that can arise when the construction continues.
He has said that in that town there are some youths who have no work of doing and urged them the construction of that pipeline to come out and ask for employment, a situation that will contribute to a wave of youths who are in the streets to get work.
Matina has said that in the construction of that pipeline, oil depends on the presence of more than 1000 employment to the residents of that town, a situation that can grow the district's economy very fast.
He has urged the youth to form groups that will be a big source that will contribute to speed up employment from those investors in the construction of that oil pipeline which is expected to start soon.
That district commissioner has also urged the councilors of that council to stop doing political work but to be for the purpose of serving the citizens who participated in various development activities in their wards.
