Diamond has talked about that they have died.

For a long period of time since the year 2012, there has been different reports that go through the newspapers, blogs and open various people that the 'wasanii wa bongofleva' star is mentioned to be paid a lot of money in doing the show in Tanzania, Ommy Dimpoz has died.

After that, I have been trying to work with Diamond but he didn't like to see it at that time.

Diamond has changed the stand and decided to officially open up in the interview with Millinga, all of them being mentioned.

I believe I am not just saying "when you are doing well, there is no need to do, like a life, many artists do not do a show but I did I do, even when I went to Dar Live you want people to sign the virus, wanting to make the environment.

"Fans are required to say a lot, maybe now he has died but the fans are every day they continuing to buy my work, they continuing to ask my songs on the radio, therefore my songs are very much" - Diamond.

In very few sentences Diamond has said, "there is a newspaper that I don't know her is the last year, Diamond I don't know if I have been paid a lot of money more than any other artist, that is why I didn't know everything that I have gone back, therefore I am unable to release my music.
