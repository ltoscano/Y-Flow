Reasons for the war of Kagera 1979.

Uganda and Tanzania was on war after what is claimed that it is an invasion of Uganda in Kagera area, therefore, Tanzania is forced to shine after it was correct for Tanzania to destroy the president of this year, Idd wants us to understand what this situation was.
