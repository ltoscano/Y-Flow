In Nairobi, the deputy President William Ruto and journalist Joshua Nassari, who have been accused together with the International Criminal Court (ICC) wants witnesses not to be seen in that case and instead they can also be in court to give their evidence.
They said witnesses who want to eliminate the evidence that gave birth to the drivers are going on to do so before the judges of ICC.
Through the lawyer Karim, who is representing Mister Ruto, those two said that the existence of all witnesses in court is also to reduce the doubt and claims of the charges to be the accused of witnesses.
"Pickup, and my customer is that witnesses are going to arrive in front of the court but we do not want to have any enthusiasm," said Mister Khan.
According to the evidence of both sides, it will help to ensure the performance of justice.
At a meeting with journalists at the hotel in Nairobi, Mister Khan said yesterday that witnesses from both sides are going to arrive in court and said the whole truth.
