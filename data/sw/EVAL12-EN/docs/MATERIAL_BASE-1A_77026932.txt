CCM has a agenda with the sports grounds?
Sports is not only entertainment, but it is the main source of revenue and economy of the country and countries that continue, sports is used well and has given a lot of employment.
However, in our country, the situation has been contrary to the government leaders who have been good to make on stage or public meetings and the campaign that sports is employment but they have been unable to confirm that through actions.
In nations that are continuing, leaders have confirmed with actions and give priority to priority, with our leaders unable to accept sports as part of the economy and it has been seen every year in the government's budget.
In our budget every year, there is no challenge that is set aside for the purpose of sports development projects, there are also any efforts done by the government to ensure the company or different organizations in the country are done to enable the sports sector to grow, despite having a very employment sector.
There are several things that are required to ensure that sports becomes the main cause of revenue in the country, one of them is to ensure that infrastructure, including the fields is the same quality.
However, that issue has been difficult to be implemented because the government has released open areas including games being led by business people or citizens, then they build houses.
Also, the government has agreed to the ruling party of CCM continuing to move and insisted that all the sports grounds that are in the provinces that have been built in our country is being led by one party to continue relying on the party.
Some of the fields is CCM Kirumba, Mwanza, Samora, Iringa (Mbeya), Sheikh Amri Abeid (Arusha), Majimaji (Ruvuma), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro), Jamhuri (Morogoro
For a long time, CCM has been estimated that it is supposed to pay the death of those fields to be taken by the government because it is public property and others have been given to the citizens so that they can be able to take care of them and to help people who want to take care of the management because of helping many people and not the interests of a small group of people.
I am saying that because in the recent years the government started a plan of Big Results Now (BRN) as a catalyst in the implementation of the partnership of the partnership between the public and private sector (PPP).
The partnership, that is unacceptable, is an important system for the government to convince private investment in improving the public services.
On my view, it has come at a time for CCM or to be able to return those sports grounds in the government or greed.
These stadiums that are being in the partnership between the private sector and the government will be improved at the high quality, therefore, providing a broad employment and athletes to benefit more than it is now where those fields are criticizing and it's not a source of employment in sports.
