The committee of the soccer referees of Zanzibar (ZTC) has said that it is wrong for people who feel like to be treated with the referees in their matches to send complaints to that committee instead of dealing with insults.

That statement has been made by the chairman of that committee, Issa Machibya, when he spoke to the writer of this news after the completion of the session of that committee and the leadership of Multichoice Tanzania.
Ahmada has said that if the referees have been sent away and told that they do not get accurate words during their referees when they err.
He said they have discovered that people who have been threatening the referees is those who do not know well the 17 soccer laws.
"We know if the referees have already been unable to be stopped, we are happy to be told the words that are not correct, but we believe that those doing so are people who do not affect the football laws," he said.
Therefore, he urged the people of that kind to study in soccer laws due to that this season they have state of the new law which is like looking at suddenly it is difficult.
He advised the leaders of the club to educate their fans about the changes of those laws, he said that the referees is a human being like others and they think they have no mistake is good to inform them more they do.
