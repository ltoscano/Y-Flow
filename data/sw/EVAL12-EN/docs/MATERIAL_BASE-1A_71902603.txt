The government has said all villages in the country will have been given medical services for electricity in a period of five years through the third phase government (REA).

That was stated by the Minister of Energy and Minerals, Professor Sospeter Muhongo, when he met with employees of Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) in Kagera province during his tour to inspect the earthquake activities in that province.
Speaking about the project of (REA), Minister Muhongo said that it is a big project and enough money has been built to ensure that the project is complete and as planned.
In addition, Minister Muhongo noted that eight contractors have not been allowed to work at the (REA) because they failed to reach goals and agreements that they have made a shame to the implementation of the second phase of electricity in the second phase (REA).
The minister urged those employees to avoid bribery actions including reducing the environment that can cause bribery in order to have success in their activities.
Those workers are questioning the oath before Minister and promised to be involved in bribery actions and that they will ensure that they are realizing their duties by following the law, procedures and regulations put in place.
Professor Muhongo also ordered the organization to open the office in the rural areas especially where there are many users of electricity services so as to avoid disruptions to travel long distances to the services in TANESCO offices which are in the district headquarters and provinces only.
