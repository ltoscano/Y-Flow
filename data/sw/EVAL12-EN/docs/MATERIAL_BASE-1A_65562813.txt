You are claiming from the Ngorongoro District?
Sei 30, 2015.

Earlier when I was surprised by this statement, I asked himself what the mother has meaning but as to as days passed away, I stopped him in the way and confirmed that it's true that these are Nyenshile, Ngorongoro.
When I look at the animals' program called "I hope" that is aired by DSTV let him look for a small voice in their activities of moving from Tanzania to Kenya.
The animals who traveled with big groups is very big and if you look at each other, but many believe it takes the basis of their colleagues in front, without even knowing what is there.
These residential houses arriving at that river land without any precaution and then they are faced and cheek and doesn't be sold to food, so when the mother did well and some of the people here in the country who are doing their things like a football.
I am taking this opportunity to congratulate that mother to Doctor Magufuli, my former friend to me, I know this day he cannot inform me because when he was talking to the party, I did not want him to meet him because I was not aware of the party and I don't want jokes, "I cannot be careful.
However, he made a meeting with journalists for the first time since he left his party at Serena Hotel, a party which he built the building and given a great goalkeeper, I had not want to tell me.
Maybe I say recently, Doctor, I am a good friend who we arrived in Moshi at a meeting with the bishops of the Catholic Church of East and Central Africa (Amnesty International).
When the meeting was surprised when we met at the Kilimanjaro Airport (KIA), I told me I live there, then I'm happy and told me a car which he has given a new song number + 1, which was told to track his car until it was found, when he found himself to return.
There was a famous thing in Arusha, he is a famous person in Arusha and Arusha. His wife was a suspect in the Tanzania Airports Authority, Doctor I think that I remember now.
Let me go back to Nyenshile, Ngorongoro and those who know themselves with me claiming that another name was closed, I was surprised so much and asked me why he won't qualify.
I asked himself why this has been able to say Nyanga of Ngorongoro are making things that without knowing they can be able to find themselves with the citizens of Tanzania in a lot of violence.
This is wrong to remind of the destruction during what he is looking at what happens inside and what does it hunt?
You don't listen to the destruction that others make the whole time to dirty, an old man, an old man to talk about poverty because you will be rich if you will have twenty thousand shillings and one with a car which will have twenty vehicle.
Why is the intention of yourself what I was in Monduli, why poverty has been increasing in a lot of water even the water is very big and even when you get poverty, even your hotel in Monduli, which is the tourism is very bad, food and water are not sure.
The heart of coldness, fire water is very attractive because the "
You are the source of getting the economy of this country.
