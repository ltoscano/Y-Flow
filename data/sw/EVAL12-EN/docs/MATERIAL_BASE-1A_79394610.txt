The government has a close executives in reproductive health and child to build a close partnership in the implementation of their responsibilities so that we can be able to reach and even reach the goals to reach the quarter-year-finals by five thousand shillings, while the member of parliament from Dodoma province has touched me.
The call has been made in Dodoma by the acting chief physician of this government since we will see this is the time when he was opening a meeting for you the coordinators of the provinces and region in the health service unit.
.
.
I love him.
What is the disease.
The sun is on going to Dodoma recently.
Meat is meat in work.
The last minutes.
I also have.
Together with we expect to start getting success in reducing the deaths of young children and those under the age of five, we will enable the executives to be treated with those achievements and therefore they don't have the aim of ensuring that there is no child.
Previously when he was welcoming the acting chief physician of the government closing the annual meeting of the assistant director of reproductive health and child health in the ministry of health and community welfare we were able to share experiences and get solutions to the challenges that arose in their areas where the participants were able to exchange experiences and get solutions to the challenges that arose in their areas where the participants were able to exchange experiences and get solutions to the challenges that happened in their areas.
.
And running the things that we have.
But in addition to wanting the Almighty God to inform the Almighty we cannot see the meeting, the retired procedures have been in the region in the health and reproductive health service and the child managed to get out as a sign of the ministry of health and development of the community to recognize that machine.
From here to Dodoma a bomb.
