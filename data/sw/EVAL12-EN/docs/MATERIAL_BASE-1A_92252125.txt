Recently, the teams to sign him are Simba and Yanga only?
I was coming out to your Citizen newspaper so that I want me to say it is this habit of players of different teams to uplift two matches or Simba or Yanga.
I have been followed up especially the small team, you will find that Yanga or Simba are playing football and even sometimes to win or from a draw, but they get to other teams be sold easily.
It's impossible for Simba and Yanga to save and then be supported by a small team and maybe be evident, if you will play a big ball, not our league will have sexual excitement but it doesn't have a lot of benefits like the management, you will discover themselves with Simba and Yanga, a team hope.
