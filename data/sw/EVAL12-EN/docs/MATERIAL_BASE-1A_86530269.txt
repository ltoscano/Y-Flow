Several days after the spread of the song that is believed to be Ali Kiba with the name Race, the singer has stolen his song and claimed that he has not know anything about that song and even he has never heard.

"The songs are there but I did not come out of songs, I have not given a song to grow them and I don't know who she is doing and I have never seen," said Ali Kiba.

That singer has added that people have found himself silent and they have decided to give a song with his name that it does not have any logic or that they think those people have done hard so that they can have a lot of professionalism that will make their voice down.

He has said he doesn't know the aim of someone who did, "I will be a hat trick which has been made but I don't know who but I don't like to be in great shape."

He has placed a case and it may also be a person that she sang is a person that he would like him as a model.
