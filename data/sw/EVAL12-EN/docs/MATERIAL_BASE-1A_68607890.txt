The High Court of Dar es Salaam has refused the request for the Tanzania Central Bank's lawyer (BoT) to prevent journalists who are not involved in a case against the implementation of the order that the bank can pay shillings 92.

Judge Ama Munisi, has given that decision after the lawyer of the bank, Karim Rashid to claim that that case was not heard the privacy of other people including journalists are not allowed to listen.
I see there are people who performed inside here and when we are looking at themselves, they don't know themselves, so that this process is not heard.
Judge Munisi says even though they are listening to the privacy of the issue, it is clear that the case is not the privacy, therefore it is permission to enter and listen.
The case was mentioned today for the purpose of listening to the objection of the Coast Mariners company Twilumba Mlelwa, to oppose the request of stopping the implementation of the order to pay those funds that had been presented by the Governor of the Central Bank of Tanzania (BoT), Professor Benno Ndulu.
