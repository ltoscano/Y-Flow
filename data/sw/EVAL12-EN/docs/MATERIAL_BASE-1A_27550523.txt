Still in Dodoma town where the prime minister Mizengo Pinda has talked about the decision taken by the Zanzibar government to ban the wearing of a short message during this month of the honorable prime minister Pinda said that in parliament in Dodoma town, during a brief statement he was asked by the member of parliament of Iringa town where the prime minister Pinda has urged the citizens to respect the decision.
The statement is out by the leader of the revolutionary government in Zanzibar.
What I think about here is it possible for the environment of the revolutionary government in Zanzibar.
During the whole month of Ramadhan, it has noted that it can help them to have a good example.
Believe I think it is good here is saying that we are marrying them in way they are seen in a environment.
But the?
One and the wearing of sin?
Ras Kiduku was found.
I think most of us agree that it is a good thing that is not good.
It needs to be true and said each one.
