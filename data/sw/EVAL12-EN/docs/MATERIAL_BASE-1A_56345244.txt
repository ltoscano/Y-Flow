The late?
On my side about the topics that we have organized.
It is related.
The delay of contributing to Tanzanians is being unable to contribute to soccer to invest ', in games that have affected us.
Hayatou will talk about one thing or two.
The first issue arrived to inform another in the international tournament.
For example we see the western countries.
Which is for example, in Cameroon, we have seen the way.
How they have invested early in soccer so that they can help them to reach the goal is to play in the international competitions, we see the world cup the world was trying, I wish you so much for example in this world's world cup and ten thousand if we saw it in Germany.
Therefore, it's impossible for forgiveness from being conned each other.
That we are only ten Tanzanians that cause a hyena.
To go to the international competitions like other nations.
And for example, the European nations are doing this one, "Success is a lot in sports because of what?
They have invested early early, the commission that led them for many years after many years get success and fruits in sports in various international competitions, have assessed them to arrive early, so that we find themselves so much and that is why they get them early and that is why it led them.
Those results are fruits after everything that I got in early, I think that if you want to get enough preparations, you can't make sure we continue to do if we have started, we have begun to plan for me a long time.
The logo?
Just now I have put effort and efforts so that you can't reach the international tournament.
