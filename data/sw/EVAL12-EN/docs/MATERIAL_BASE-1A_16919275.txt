In this district, we have urged the youths to implement the order of President John Magufuli of cleaning.
While speaking at the time they participated in together with the cleaning the day before yesterday, the chairperson of UVCCM in the district, Magdalena Munisi, said that every youth had a responsibility of putting a clean environment, it will help to avoid epidemics.
On their part, the members of CCM, Richard Lugome and Amina Shabani said youths have shown their union of cooperating with that issue, therefore it is good to be followed by being a good example in the community. "Do a cleanup every month will be sustainable, therefore citizens and other youths have no need to partner," said Shabani.
