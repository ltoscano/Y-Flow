It has been explained that the Kilimanjaro province is in danger of changing the sun due to a huge speed of trees done by citizens, including running the agricultural activities and housing sources.

As a result of that risk, the Provincial Commissioner of Kilimanjaro, Said Meck Sadiki, has issued an order to district heads and directors of this province to inspect all water sources and take stern legal action against all those who do business work on water sources.
Sadiki said that during a tree planting exercise that was organized by the water and Environment Authority in Moshi town (MUWSA), in the Shiri water source which is in Hai District, here in this province, being the commemoration in mind the death of the father of the nation Mwalimu Julius Nyerere.
A tree planting trees is also said to aim to honor him from the late Mwalimu Nyerere, in charge of the environment.
He said as a result of citizens living in a large extent, the city of Moshi now has been in danger to change the desert, a situation that causes the life of citizens and the economy of the nation.
Sadiki said that in the previous years the citizens of Kilimanjaro province did not have a habit of vying for water or irrigation water, but now people have started to vie for water because of the shortage of that service that was caused by death of trees in large numbers.
The Director of Authority for clean water and environmental cleanliness in Moshi town, Joyce Msepwa, said the source has been of great help to citizens in providing clean and safe water services, whereby it has had the ability to produce clean and safe water per day and to serve more than 39,500 citizens of Hai District and Moshi Municipality.
