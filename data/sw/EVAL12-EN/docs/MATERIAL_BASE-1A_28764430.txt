Maggid Mjengwa, I was saying that the name of the business is what I want to start with it and I see that it will be the late.
Now there will be a place where we get in Dar es Salaam, when you get a person getting us about credit, the late God is good and then you will pay for it the world.
I have been given out with this continent that you love you, the late God bless you and I don't know the husband then I will do something that is used so much, I wish you the capital one.
He told me they will thank you.
I sell and you are going to take his trip by so I think that Christians will help me Kiango, will help and look for the late God and let me look for a house that night.
Welcome him to see.
This was which it was a house to send my friend when I see I will be a very high price.
The Lord does not have a high price even if you look for if you look at each other you will remain with the late or you know who again you want to see if you know if you know if you know if you know if you know if you know if you know if you know as words.
Very much and that was given you completely after doing business, the late does not get a problem that I saw to protect their house, it's also told.
