My lover has gone, and I told me not to be worried.
My friend I need your help, there is a youth who we have been friends for two years now and he has a wife. "We are going so much and she told me not to be worried about your advice.
Through the headlines, it is good that you are worried because that is a husband to himself and his wife knows how he can take any action against you to protect his marriage.
His lover does not want jokes, I don't have a lover that she does not like to ask questions and each other, I asked me if I want to listen to me what should I do?
I have seen you for your friend who I have found himself after he refused to get a girl, my time several times speaking to another man.
He insists that they are only friends but I believe there is more.
Then, I urge you.
You cannot get the statement that those two have a relationship because it has given you speaking.
If you are read while you take enough time to reduce them so that you get enough evidence that you are lovers, we should take this action against them.
