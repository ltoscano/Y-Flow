And the holy martyr, there should not be on Friday yesterday on the thigh of the heroes grounds where they have requested the government to stop the construction of a gas pipeline from Mtwara up to Dar es Salaam so as to save a car which is between the community and the government in that region is not a problem here in the country.
It is reached by that without that is not bad.
Where and saying that when I see the grave of the graves, they believe that their responsibility is in order to advise the government to change the construction of a gas pipeline so as to know the government's responsibilities in order to know the progress of development in that province, his condition is not aware of the development.
Women.
They have been a silence.
My way to sleep she knows me.
Previously they were giving greetings from various countries in that province, religious leaders have explained that there are leaders of the government that make corrections so that after the room, where the aim is to vote, then request the government to build a Mtwara rural electrification project and being transported to other provinces with you or Nairobi some of the youth.
When they are there.
Others are there.
Little of us.
What is the meaning of God?
People are the need of continuing.
To be heard.
I was surprised that stern action is one of the channel, captain.
