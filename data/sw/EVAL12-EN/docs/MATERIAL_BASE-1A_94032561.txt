President Baranaba giving policies to the police force in general.
Brightiles 15, 2013.

In a state of events of police alleged to kill or injured and the police themselves at times being injured or killed, and then the existence of fear among the police and other community institutions has been able to form the deaths, leadership of the police force has been active and causing deaths.

This culture has been passing through political parties, especially the opposition parties, including CHADEMA, CUF, NCCR-Evolution and other stakeholders, as part of the institution with people who are accused of being involved in those events, it is not correct or not for them to form those events.

We believe it is not a sin for police to form a committee to investigate events of those types, but we insisted that the investigation should be for their internal reports in that force which will help them to send the mockery, according to these weaknesses.

But we also believe that it is not good for the committees of that kind to be relied upon by the government together with the citizens in general that the only ones for making that investigation is then for the investigation, the concerned committee will be believed to give the right report.

We believe it is not good because for now, the complaints against the police force have emerged to come out every day, to have complaints with primary issues or complaints that have no primary issues, but in general they are complaints that are supposed to understand but be done to work.

Therefore, if an emergency action is to get a solution to the full problem, we advise that events of the kind we have explained earlier it should be independent, the assistant commissioner of police, Abdallah Zuckerberg has said he was accused of being involved in the killings of the business people of minerals, commission led by Judge Musa Lyombe.

But in the general step of getting a solution, it is now time for the country's president to form the commission to investigate and then give recommendations on how to strengthen the army for the interests of the country because more than 50 years of supervision, are insufficient.
