The problem of the shortage of transport agencies between Zanzibar and Tanzania Mainland, including a huge loss, has contributed to the existence of money relief for passengers and causing huge discomfort.

Money for those tickets have been witnessed by the deputy minister of communication, construction and transport, Mohammed Ahmada when he toured the port area of Malindi.
One ticket of a car that is going on fast has been done by the Azam Marine Company that is sold at 20,000 shillings depending on the price and to reach 30,000 shillings.
Ahmada has said yesterday it has shown his disappointment with the problem and promised to work on the reason that causes the major disruptions to the citizens, including women and elderly.
He said that although the problem has been contributed to a large extent and lack of many organs that perform the journey between Zanzibar and Tanzania Mainland, but it should not be a reason to increase the price to that level and caused the major disruptions to citizens with low-income citizens.
The Communications Manager of Azam Marine Company, Ali Mohamed Abeid, confessed the existence of the problem of smuggling which have been fighting with it at a high level.
