Makalla increased traffic police.
Mbarali District Commissioner, Amos Makalla has urged the head of Mbarali District, Gullet he should not tell him, to give him the names of police who are alleged to give permission to farmers with an aim of getting married.
Makalla made the directive the day before yesterday when he was speaking to village leaders, ward, and representatives of farmers and breeders in the meeting to give them the land law number five (5) of 1999 and its laws of 2001, section number eight, with an aim of buying land conflicts.
Previously, while giving the district report, Kifu said there are claims that some of the police are doing a conspiracy by the business people to set aside an environment of getting a cow as a result of breeders and therefore they agree on a case.
"We have told these people are responsible for the environment of having a special judge who will agree that he is going to listen to those cases and to put things related to them," he claimed the district commissioner.
However, he said the security committee was forced to work on that issue and requested the police commissioner to take legal action against them.
Makalla said that the step will be on Saturday and all the names be handed to his office.
He said that the act done by those police is against the law and legal action should be taken against them so that it should be a lesson to others.
Makalla said that the time of people to work with fear in government is over.
He wanted each one to be accountable in his position so that the citizens can be able to get services as it is the governor.
