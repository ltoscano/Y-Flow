Wiz Khalifa, Spohr, who is a new striker who was signed from Mtibwa Sugar this season, has five goals same as the player of Congo Aay, one of his goals was the one that scored against Simba in Dar es Salaam.
That has a meaning, if the speed will be taken until the end of the day, those players won by goals, then Bahama have given the golden shoe because he has no goal through a penalty, more that he scored in the match against 1-1 in the 90th minute.
That penalty on a penalty against the training goal to decide the winner through the yellow card "among those teams has not been put in the list of its goals.
Hamisi Kiiza is Diego Gutierrez, the another star of Yanga from Uganda, is the second best player for his four goals, followed by Suleiman's of APR the three goals.
