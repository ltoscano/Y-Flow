Bariadi and five teachers have been charged with their crops being married on the internet and the villagers on claims of preventing the villagers to protect their livestock in school areas.
That was said yesterday by the secretary of the Tanzania teachers' Association (CT) in Bariadi District, Baraka Otolo, when he spoke to the journalists after the incident.
Those teachers are teaching primary primary schools, Nkenye region, Nkenye region, Nkenye region and Nyamkazi Primary School.
Obrey Chirwa has mentioned those teachers who are alleged to be played as Masumbuko Jackson, George Simbachawene, popularly known, Joseph Marco, Zacharia Jeremiah and Hovind, who have left their health centers.
Odax said, despite being beaten, those teachers have also been given directions by the villagers who call themselves as they are preparing to prevent students or walking on people's lives so that they can't know the reasons that made them do.
"The government may come out in this issue so as to build faith in teachers and other servants continue to work in those areas without fear and if this issue it will be dealt with quickly as possible, we will remove the teachers in those schools which have been a problem," said Otieno.
