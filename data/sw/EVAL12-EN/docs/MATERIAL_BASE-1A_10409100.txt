The state of availability of important medicines to the medical equipment (MSD) in the northern region is also critical because of a huge shortage, a situation that causes patients to lack medicine in hospital and health centers.

Speaking to this newspaper in his office, the Executive Manager of medical services in the northern region, Bilali has admitted the existence of lack of important drugs in its course, due to the budget of the year 2015 / 2016 of the Ministry of Health, Social Development, Gender, Elderly and Children.
Singano said the important drugs that are reduced in that activity is the cause of drug abuse and mental patients, something he explained that it is a big challenge that is causing patients to buy drugs at a high cost in the private sector.
He said the main job of MSD is to make procurement, save and spreading drugs at the government hospitals, health centers and in religious organizations that have been sponsored by the Ministry of Health, Social Development, Gender, Elderly and Children.
He said that the required money to buy drugs is 360 billion shillings, but in the year 2015 / 2016, the Ministry of Health, Social Development, Gender, the Elderly and Children's budget has been set aside 1000 shillings and he believes that it will remove the problem at work.
