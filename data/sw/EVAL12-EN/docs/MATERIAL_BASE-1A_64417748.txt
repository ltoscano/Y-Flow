TUCTA who bought a stern warning.

With Grace Ndeki.

The Federation of staff for workers in the country (TUCTA), has said it will be able to take more action against the government as it will continue considering various claims of workers.
Speaking to journalists in Dar es Salaam yesterday.
Of that federation, Mister Omar Juma, said right now.
Ready to go back since they have got enough experience.

He said the 24 session of the executive committee that was done in December this year, continued to discuss closely the state of working environment in the country and given its recommendations to the government.

"TUCTA has urged the government in its budget of the year 2013 / 14, to beef up employees in the public sector by 100 percent so that they can be able to sustain their lives," he said.

He added that the government is supposed to take appropriate measures to ensure that inflation is under 10 percent before April 2013.

Mister Juma said the government intends to promote the low rate of income and payment of fees in the private sector before April 2013, to reduce tax revenue collection and to reach 11 percent.

He said it has come at the time of the government to put open its strategies to avoid problems of lack of employment instead of developing words of giving hope.

"The issue of the increase in energy especially electricity, electricity, and for the purpose of running the machines, petrol and diesel in the country should be looked at keenly because the citizens have gotten tired to see its cost competing in the day up to day," he said.

He added that the relationship between TUCTA and the government will continue as claims of employees will be implemented for an appropriate time.
