"Join the economic networks it will help him a woman to have a great entrepreneur and it will also enable how to get the capital of his business," said Bilali.
However, he wanted that institution to sit together and exchange ideas with other women and build a network of information on entrepreneurship because he wanted the government of Tanzania to appreciate women and children because they have already had their ministry which is being addressed on the gender issues, women and children so as to use required.
And the wife of the Prime Minister, Tunu Pinda has said that women are required to come out on the front line in development issues so that they do not win their rights.
"Many women like to go back in issues of development we women are the one-fielder and therefore, it is supposed to get every part so that our nation can know what we are doing," said mother Pinda.
