The District Court of Ilala in Dar es Salaam has thrown out a sentence of life in prison, Gajir Kayombo (23), a resident of Kivule-Lamadi County, after beating him as an offense of carrying a three and a half years old.

While reading the judgment yesterday, the resident magistrate of the High Court, Youngsevier Msuya said that the court has organized himself by the evidence that was given by the prosecution, after presenting seven witnesses.
"The court is supposed to be known as an offense of having a three-year-old child contrary to the brain, therefore it gets a sentence of life in prison to be a lesson to all who continue to be involved in such actions," he said.
Before being given that judgment, the government's lawyer, James Mtayakingi Kilaba urged the court to give a great punishment to be a lesson to others due to the increase of those actions.
However, Kayombo presenting his defense claimed that he has a family that depends on and that it is his first time to do that action.
He was alleged to have used that offense on August 9, last year, at 6 o'clock in the evening in Kivule-Kitunda Ward and caused her severe pain.
