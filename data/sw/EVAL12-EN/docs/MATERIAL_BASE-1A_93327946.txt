Judge wants to stop the case of Lema.

It has been written by Pamela McLendon in Arusha.

I was heard of 12th October, 2016.

Resident magistrate of Arusha Resident Magistrate Court, Augustino Ramadhani said that he has given 60 days to the Attorney General of Arusha Town, God bless Lema, it is complete and he will leave that case.

Rwizile said that the statement made at the Resident Magistrate Court in Arusha after the lawyer of the government, Msalika asked for the case because the investigation is not complete.
After Maswa District gave that request, the lawyer who is supporting Lema who is John Mallya told the judge that if the government lawyers claim that the case was not complete and the case was decided by the court.
Lema is being faced with two cases, where the first case is accused by sending a short message of words on September first this year, through number 4675711475 and 75 million shillings to Arusha Provincial Commissioner, Mrisho Gambo, when you say 'welcome him is controlling it as usual.
Other cases, Lema is being used by using WhatsApp and offloading agents, to write the language of incitement between August first and 26 this year, to convince the citizens of Arusha City to demonstrate to September first this year.
