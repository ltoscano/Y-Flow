Al-Shabaab of Mtwara on another debate.
October 11, 2013.

The news published yesterday in some of the newspapers in the country, on Tuesday, October 8, this week, that in Mtwara, South Africa, the youth group has been carried out a terrorist attack in Mount Makabane.
According to the news reports that brought me several leaders of the state agencies and the government in Mtwara province, those youths mentioned to be among the age of 18 and 39 years, who were found dead in some of the video regions with instructions of training.
That event in Mtwara is the surprising thing and basically, it is same as the bell that has raised you or put the speed of the security and security agencies in the country to ask ourselves, when those youths who were arrested are good, we are those who have been arrested or succeed in order to implement the rebels groups like women, Joseph Kvitova in Uganda?
If the sponsors of that group of youth are from outside the country or even in the country - it is at least make steps to prevent the plans that is against the constitution of the country but these organizations have succeeded to make that opportunity and eventually make their training camp and the official training of them?
So, other mountains in various areas of the country, that deals with Mount Meru and Mtwara, is safe for who are ensuring the safety of that mountains in which some of our union like citizens and even by involving security agencies, we have been unable to control the forest on the relevant mountains.
So, the defense and security committee in the provinces and the districts are required to deal with threats from the state of peace in the country or these are the committee to control political events in the country and other things should not be written because, the security agencies are required to be priority to the top leaders of the media and all citizens in general.
