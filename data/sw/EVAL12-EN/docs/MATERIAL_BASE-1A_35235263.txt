Bagamoyo District, Coast Province, have requested the government to intervene in the controversy which is between them and the investor who was given out 500 acres so that they can be able to stop their balances.
That position has been given at the end of the week at a public meeting that took place in that village which led by the community of political parties in that district where the guest of honor was the chairman of the community, Mister Abdul Sharifu.

A resident of that village, Mister Juma Mohamed, said for a long time since the investor to be given to that area, he has failed to do any development issue and work on them.

"He said the government will be careful so that this area can be able to return to the village government and be used in the community service instead of continuing to remain in the investor," he said.

He said that apart from the investor to fail in that area, the promise he made during the time he made it to build a health center and to give him that he has failed.

I am an investor who asked to be given the area so as to do agricultural activities that will benefit our village but he has failed to do so, it will make our area, "said Mister Mohamed.


On his part, the councilor of Mbesa Ward, Mister Omary Mhando, said the investor was given that area in 2003 and they were unable to communicate with him so that they can know the reasons that made them to make them but they don't know it.

"Three years have already been seen here to the village, so that citizens can get their balances, so they are supposed to prepare a meeting with passing the intention of going to the area, the reports of that meeting will be channeled in councils for more steps," he said.
