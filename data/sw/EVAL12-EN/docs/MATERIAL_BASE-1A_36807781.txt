TFF has been banned from Nyamiyaga hospital for two years to play the Football Club after signing up to his lover.

The 72-day committee of the premier league that met today through various sports reports that was played in the premier league and the First Division League in the country, has been banned from playing football for a period of two years and a fine of two million shillings (2,000,000 shillings) following the act of humiliation that he made as Azam FC player John Bocco.

Nyami made that action in the first game number 32 of the VPL between Azam FC and Mbeya City that took place at the Chamazi Stadium, Dar es Salaam, due to having a habit of doing such acts of misconduct immediately in the premier league games.
