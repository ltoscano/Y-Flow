ATCL has died from foreign enemies.
Tanzania Airports Authority (ATCL) which is currently known as Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL) has died because the government itself has launched its own life.
I am saying that because there is no good plans and he was set and managed fully in order to withstand the charts like, Ethiopia and Kenya.
Despite those carelessness, it has been faced with sharp teeth that will be done by foreign enemies and inside the belief that it is their benefit and I request the government to reduce them because it is their benefit and we have not allowed them to go to the stadium for a few people to pay for a few passengers.
This is the meaning that it has been, you are made a organization to be careful so that his employees can be used by other foreign companies.
A citizen does not mean?
