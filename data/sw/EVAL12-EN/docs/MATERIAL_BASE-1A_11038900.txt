Mama Karume went to fight, we want our field?
I have been much by Yanga leaders to enter into power for other four years.
The truth is that the opportunity is good and a good thing, therefore, it is the responsibility of leaders who are chosen to supervise the stadium of the stadium.
Italy is very happy to see Yanga becomes a stadium as it is in Azam.
We know the investment is possible, as a stadium in Nyamagana has given a dummy check and it is unable to stop at Shabiby bus?
The leaders of Yanga who came to power, I know there is a lot of doing in the club and more to ensure Yanga is doing well in its national and international matches, but the biggest is to see the success have been found.
I have directed the issue of Yanga to have its stadium because the team have complained of the income, now this is when Yanga plans to have a stadium.
I was surprised to be the issue of the stadium, Mama Fatma Karume, I pray to the fight to ensure Yanga gets its stadium, Yanga becomes modern in the sector of soccer and succeed in his soul.
