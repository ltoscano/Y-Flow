District commissioner of Temeke in Morogoro Province, Kasele says that he is supposed to be supported by the councilor of Swaya Ward, Said Tila because of violating the directive by President John Magufuli of preventing demonstrations that have no benefit and instead encourage citizens to work.

News from the district are saying that the councilor is alleged to convince him to encourage and prepare demonstrations by motorbike riders who oppose the action of the police to arrest them immediately because of violating traffic rules by removing the demonstrators to go to the DC the day before yesterday.
Speaking about the incident, DC Majura said that together with the councilor to encourage the drivers of motorcycle riders to come out in large numbers to inspect them, he also violated the directive by the president and wanted the politicians to avoid politics instead of waiting for citizens to work hard.
Apart from those demonstrations, causing disturbance to the citizens and disrupt the work performance, they also caused a tour by Morogoro Provincial Commissioner Doctor Stephen Kebwe which he can make him in the district.
DC Majura said that apart from preparing those demonstrations, that councilor has been several times, sending the citizens in his ward to inspect the participation of various development activities.
He urged the citizens in that district to avoid acts of violating the law and destruction of peace because he will not be patient with any person or a group of the people that will affect the instructions of the government.
Doctor Kebwe instructed the youth of an entrepreneur to get a driving training at Veta Stadium which is in that district and encouraged to follow the road laws as well as participating in security laws to identify the criminals that are using their air transport.
