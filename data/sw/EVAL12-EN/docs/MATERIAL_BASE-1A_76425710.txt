Research: The popularity of the artists that supports CCM, has broken him!

Since the start of campaigns for the general election that is expected to take place on October 25th, 2015, various artists came out to support in UKAWA or CCM. It is a fact that the party has collected a big group of artists such as Wema Sepetu, Peter Msechu, JB and many others as' Sura Sirari.

Among those who were involved in more campaigns in the internet, because of live politics and there are some who were studying times, that is like they are not in.

In a group that were doing campaigns on social networks like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and in general, their popularity has dropped compared to previously, you can make sure that you can have a few hours, something that was seen as usual.

The situation is very different from the artists that came out in UKAWA such as Aunt Ezekiel, Shamsa Ford, and his colleagues have attacked their own photos, Facebook, Who Lives Forever, have been into a pearl, people have shown to reduce them with joy by getting enough money despite getting married.

That is a good example that we should not have living in mind, artists are supposed to read different times and even are interests, then do not fulfill your popularity and to reduce maybe if you have decided to politics to be your work.

And at this end, it is like that dispute which is well prepared so that you can be the winner.
