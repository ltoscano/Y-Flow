The music artist of the new generation, Nurdin Bilal, "Shetta," (father Kayla), has said he had gone to bathe his fellow artist to get the money to record.

"Kilufi added that in his heart, it was told that there I will give you, I thank you despite being interviewed but I had come to get money and enter the studio and today my life has been changed," said Shetta.
