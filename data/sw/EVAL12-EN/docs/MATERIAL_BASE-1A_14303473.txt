The late?
Yes, why do you know Faiza as they read the late.
How did God create?
I don't look through the law and there I heard early, the late God is the one with the sun and breast cancer like the ones that are in Dar es Salaam.
Almighty God rest his soul in order for you to know that, it is good that we want to know if you know where I will get to me or I want to another by Ambassador Seif that I don't have a lot of voice even if you don't say a school.
When he was a season, it's not several hours I have scored a voice and the one with tourists and then told the late God, that she wants to take him and he would like to talk to you.
