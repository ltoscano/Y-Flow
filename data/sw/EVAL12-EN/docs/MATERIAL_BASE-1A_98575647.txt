The national soccer team of youth under the age of 17, Serengeti Boys, tomorrow will be at the Uhuru Stadium in Dar es Salaam to join Congo witnessed in the international match to qualify for the African Cup finals to youths of that age.

That tournament has been planned to take place in Madagascar and Serengeti has a great opportunity to qualify for the tournament.
In the year 2005, Tanzania has ever played in the European Champions League, but we were removed after it was revealed that we used a player to play in the age of age.
More than 10 years now, there have been ways that concern them and maybe our youth can make us listen to each other and qualify for those finals.
To identify the difficulty of tomorrow's match, even our opponents also want the opportunity to qualify for victory by the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) to convince him to camp those players in which they went to Madagascar.
We believe that in those camp, our youth have learned different issues and we have made various flag such as usual, it will fall in a friendly match and in South Africa.
We request the youths to consider the teachings of our teachers and to stop discipline in all the time of the game in the tomorrow's match and the repeat match that will happen after two weeks.
But also on the side of stakeholders of this games, it is the right time to support this team and not to wait until they qualify to be given a red carpet.
Ways to support our team there are many, including going to the field or to give any contribution to our representatives and to recognize that we are together with them and each one in Serengeti Boys "for sure we can grow.
