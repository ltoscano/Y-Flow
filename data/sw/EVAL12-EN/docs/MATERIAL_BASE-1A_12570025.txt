Reports from the training camp for the national team known as preparing for the Mnazi Mmoja stadium they said that the head coach Adel Jola asking him to entertain at the training.
When he was asked through the phone, I have been planted, that his intention is to arrive at the training due to several activities of bidding farewell to AFC Leopards team that was prepared until they separated last month.
I have been planted, he had planned to join Taifa Stars camp yesterday before those reports.
I was a lot of activities that made me remember and I was not ready to arrive at the camp today (yesterday) after communicating with soccer heads in the country.
