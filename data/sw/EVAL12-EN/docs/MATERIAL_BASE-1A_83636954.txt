ICC has now denied the request of masturbation.
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has refused the request by the head of Gioia Tauro Chambo, wanting to oppose the claims that it did not cooperate with the investigation on the case facing President Uhuru Kenyatta.
In the request he used that court, Professor Idriss Kikula has wanted to be given a time to defend the government against the claims by the prosecutor Miss Fatna Bissau, that the government refused to help him in that case.
Instead, three judges who deals with that case led by the plan is complete, they said it will be allowed to discuss two other issues that he listed in his request at a special session that will be prepared tomorrow.
"The court recognizes that the government of Kenya have already discussed with it the issue of claims of not collaborating with them, through the ban that was presented in court to oppose the claims of the prosecutor," the judges said.
Professor Ole Sendeka is expected to be in ICC as a friend of the court, and he does not like to represent any side that involved in that case.
One of the issues required to explain it is about how the president meets with the importance of others that made up of the constitution continues to be involved in government partnership and the court.
Miss Bongole said he wanted the court to give a decision that Kenya finished his responsibility as required in the Roma agreement by refusing to give the help to its investigation, and the step taken against the government.
He complained that the government has refused to help them to get important financial documents for President Kenyatta, so that to identify that it is true that the president followed the violence after elections.
