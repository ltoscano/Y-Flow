Watch Doctor Tulia Ackson, I have great contribution from being a member of parliament for a car, they will be grafted so I wish you on this.

The presidential candidate of the Revolutionary Party (CCM), Doctor Tulia Ackson, has denied the claims that he has not been given that opportunity as he did in order to take this government.

He has said the claims that he will buy the government because he is a nominated member of parliament not to be the foundation because he did not go in parliament to serve the president but to serve Tanzanians.

President John Magufuli on Monday this week appointed Doctor Ackson, as the nominated member of parliament and revoke his position of the deputy lawyer of the government that he was appointed recently by retired President Jakaya Kikwete.

"It is true that I have been appointed by the president, but I will go to work harder, when I get a chance to be the deputy speaker claiming that I will face the government," said Doctor Ackson, who recently passed with one statement by the members of CCM that his candidate is a shame.

He said it is good for members of parliament to be faith in him and to give him good cooperation so that he can implement its responsibilities as required.
In another step, the fight is a shame for the speaker of the 11th Parliament, over over, after, Doctor Ackson, followed by one of the members of CCM to vie for that position.

Previously there was a huge tension inside the party between members of parliament of that party, who were divided into some of the member of parliament of Ilala, Mussa Azzan Zungu.
