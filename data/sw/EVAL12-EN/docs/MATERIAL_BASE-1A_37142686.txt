The acting secretary general of the Democracy and Development Party (CHADEMA), Salum Mwalimu has asked President John Magufuli to give an order so that all debts that are said in the government and the media were seen so that journalists can have good environment at work.

At the beginning of this week, President Magufuli visited the Uhuru International Limited Company (UWAWa) which includes Uhuru, Mzalendo newspapers and entertainment, to listen to their problems where he ordered the workers to be given their claims within one week.
The teacher gave that request yesterday, at the party's office in Dar es Salaam city, when he was speaking to journalists about political issues going on in the country.
He said in that tour, President Magufuli was listening to a difficult state of employees of the party, but also it should remember that there are other journalists who receive that problem.
He wanted the police force to make her work professionally, stomach, and honor by considering the law and added that the use of energy that are being done by that army to their opponents put up his respect.
