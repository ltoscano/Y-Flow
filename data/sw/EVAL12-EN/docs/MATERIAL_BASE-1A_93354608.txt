Tundu Lissu talks about those who want to join CHADEMA after Lowassa was received by that party.

The attorney general of CHADEMA, Tundu Lissu, has said their party is expecting to get many members after the retired prime minister Edward Lowassa joined that party.
Lissu has given that statement after the existence of information that there are members of CHADEMA who will left the party due to the arrival of Lowassa's arrival inside CHADEMA.
Speaking yesterday to the press, Lissu said.
"If there are some who will participate from CHADEMA, most of them will come to them as we are in a period that we have never happened since the system of many parties started, the ruling system was destroyed into pieces, when they are destroyed, its symptoms are people who have been in that system to leave as he did Lowassa."
"Changes in countries are looking at the ruling system and there are very delicious.
"We was welcomed to us not because they are a clean politician and we have received because we increase great strength to those who want change, have taken place in Zambia and Kenya."
Speaking about CHADEMA accused Lowassa that "he is the ones that we have to join the party, Lissu said.
In the past, "we did not have a mistake even to set up Lowassa in the group of suspects of Richmond Development, things met in parliament and he said himself was responsible."
"He resigned as Prime Minister because of Richmond Development, he also told President" what should they do if it is into the Revolutionary Party and the ruling party will fall, we will improve in the country without breaking the ruling party.
