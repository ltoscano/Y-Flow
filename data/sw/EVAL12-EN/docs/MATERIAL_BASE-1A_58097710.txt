I wish you a business person to sell those books.
Owners of the books showed up about the bad business as a result of the teachers' strike in the country.
The owner of the customer service shop in Nyansalwa Primary School, Kekeletse Phoofolo, explained that the strike of teachers had already affected their businesses.
He also pointed out that the number of customers was small compared to the previous years when they go to school.
He said that he had added that they had added the number of security but he was making a loss.
"Due to a result of the number of customers who are very much protected, a situation that has affected the purchase of books," he explained.
Schools tried to give birth to children being ordered to go back to home areas after the teachers failed to arrive in school due to a strike.
