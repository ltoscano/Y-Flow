England's veteran defender, Ashley Williams has retired from international soccer after being left outside the Roy Hodgson's squad that will meet Brazil at the World Cup.
Cole, a defender that she released Chelsea announced his retirement from international soccer on Sunday night just after signing up his players of Southampton, Lukaya, 18, in his squad of 23 players.
Shaw, who is the left defender is believed to fill the Cole's position who has played philosophically and it is among eight players who are in that squad they viewed as the age of 24 years.
"I received the phone from Claudio Ranieri's squad this year, will be afraid of many young players and due to that, it is the right time to leave the international soccer," Cole said.
It was not a very difficult decision after realizing that players will not stay with Brazil and used a lot of time to write the information of his disappointment with that step in his Twitter account.
"You go to you or you shouldn't know whether you're very happy to find themselves in this situation of stop playing for my nation, Mrs. Fauzia Kullane and I wish you a good shape and I will give you a lot of patriotism" he wrote.
On the side of Coach Kaijage, it was not a very decision but he insisted that it was better if he insisted was better without hiding anything that he does not need more services.
"That was a difficult decision to me in my coaching profession but the important thing was to speak with Ashley before announcing the squad and right that they need to change earlier and to deal with me instead of the media," the coach explained.
