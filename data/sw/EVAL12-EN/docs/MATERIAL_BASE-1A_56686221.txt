The residents of Tunduru district in Ruvuma province have complained to the step of the buses that make its journey between Tunduru and Masasi District, Mtwara province, to continue producing huge machines, despite the completion of the road construction.

Moreover, they have complained to the Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA) in Ruvuma province, from being unable to take action against the companies of those buses that are continuing to protect citizens who are facing a difficult life in life.
While speaking to this newspaper yesterday at different times, the citizens said it's something sad to see the bus owners are continuing with a dirty game of vying for 400 million shillings from Tunduru to Masasi while the fare is between 75 and 8,000 shillings.
Kassim Hassan, a resident of Majimaji village said that seems to be known as SUMATRA by the police force, road safety squad, is unable to supervise their responsibilities and set aside for those companies, that provide transport services for their private benefit.
He stopped and keenly the management that enabled the construction of that road which was a nuisance to Tunduru citizens and the provinces of Lindi, Mtwara and Ruvuma.
In addition, he urged the SUMATRA to put a friendly standards of fare depending on the distance of one area and another one, instead of leaving the buses to plan the price that will happen with the real situation of the journey.
Mohamed Rukara, has urged the Tanzania Roads Agency (TANROADS) in Ruvuma province, to put into an emergency conference on that road so as to protect themselves to get down early as a result of a series of attacks, while having a big cargo that does not coincide with the ability of that road.
