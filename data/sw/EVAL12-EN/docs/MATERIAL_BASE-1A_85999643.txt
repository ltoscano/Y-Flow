A courtesy of Ebola is enough.
The decision by Kenya together with nations of the East African Community (EAC) to send nurses and doctors to deal with Ebola in the western countries of Africa.
Kenya is planning to send 15 doctors and 300 health workers in those nations, who will be among the experts, doctors and more than 500 health workers from the EAC.
Since the ban of Ebola is a few months ago in the south of Africa, African nations have not been seen to be in the front line to give support.
Inside here in the country, there are doctors who explained to fear about the decision by the government to bring nurses from those countries though they have not received any profession about fighting Ebola.
The fear of doctors similar to the citizens who until now have faith that the government has put enough strategies to prevent the disease, to get involved in the country and also it is a better position for Kenyans to know how to deal with the danger of Ebola.
Hacould have been an appropriate time to wait until that disease should be emphasized in the western countries including America, then African nations, but if they depend on the special report later to put strategies to prevent a disaster.
It will be remembered that America found the army forces in that country, and without doubt, they will leave with great skills about how to prevent a spread of Ebola in their country.
But it's also known that the skills that will use the strategies in their country may be beneficial to their country and be beneficial to other countries due to many different meanings that are in social, political and even economically.
