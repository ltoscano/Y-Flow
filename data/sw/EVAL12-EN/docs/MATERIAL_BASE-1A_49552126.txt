I was heard of 16th September 2016.

Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries has confessed the existence of lack of livestock in some areas, a situation that causes the increase in prices of those drugs day up to day.

The Deputy Minister of Agriculture Livestock and Fisheries, William Ole Nasha, confessed the existence of that challenge and identifying issues that contribute to the situation as a shortage of private sector in some areas for the purpose of spreading drugs.
He has mentioned other reasons as some of the farmers not to have enough information on how to get the input of livestock from the real agents or distributors or thus buying those crops through the objectives of getting great benefits.
Nasha was answering a question by the nominated member of parliament, Mariam Kisimba (CCM), who wanted to know the government has a procedure of controlling the prices of livestock and agriculture that increase the day up to day.
Responding to the question, he said the National Examinations Council has continued to take appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to invest in production of livestock services in the country especially in areas of breeders so as to expand the scope of availability of those services together with drugs.
Nasha mentioned the other step is to remove the tax of bringing all the drugs that are imported into the country and the value added tax (VAT).
According to Ole Nasha, for the financial year 2016 / 2017, the government has set aside a total of five billion shillings for the purpose of buying medicine for agriculture and one billion shillings for the purpose of drug trafficking.
