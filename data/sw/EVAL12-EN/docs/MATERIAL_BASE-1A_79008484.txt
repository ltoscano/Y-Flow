Soccer coaches in Zanzibar Islands have been urged to expand the employment market of their profession outside the country instead of moving the market in Tanzania mainland only.

The call has been made by the President of the Zanzibar Football Association (TBN) in the country, Ricardo Rodriguez at the event to hand over the licenses for B Primary School during 26 points that had completed the training last month.
He said that for now, many of the teachers have been going to teach in Tanzania Mainland, together with that in Zanzibar, its market is little but they can try to look for other markets and outside the country so that they can grow.
"But I want to give emphasis on CAF license and this means not that it does not make work in Unguja and Pemba Island only or to Tanzania Mainland, to make it a certificate in the whole African continent," he said.
Moreover, he congratulated Proin Promotion Company who is in Tanzania Mainland to coach JKT Ruvu team and coach Abdalla Bares who is Ndanda FC and said that those teachers have shown an example and others should follow.
