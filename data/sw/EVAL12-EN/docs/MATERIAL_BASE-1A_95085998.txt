President Jakaya Kikwete has officially completed his four day tour in Kilimanjaro Region by putting a foundation stone on the construction of the road for political parties which is located in Arumeru district in Dodoma province, to cooperate with the leadership of Kigoma region to ensure that the road is complete as soon as possible they are doing the tour to make that road.
First on the road.
She told me there is no activities and we are continuing.
I desire to see that there is no activities they should know but the habit of putting the foundation stone on the road.
Therefore, it is not good.
Here, we are here and the winner.
Many people were written with all the problems that were there.
We will deal with.
In order for the construction to now be very fast.
I was, I was able to take him early as it doesn't be taken.
In order for the citizens to get an amount of Doctor John Magufuli and the minister of construction.
I talk about it.
This road I thank God, he has thank him, he has told him.
Later I was able to be in those videos instead of work.
The road taking high table and has been sent away.
The nominated member of parliament, Freeman Mbowe, together with citizens have commended the government's leadership to intervene in that construction which they have spoilt the situation that caused the explosion until now.
Kissava is also bullied.
Or if they identified himself.
But they don't cause the poor.
I am running a lot inside the United Republic of Congo, if I was still a problem, he has said that two president have a lot as a very big way to build houses.
First inside the nation I don't have a official statement of our brother to stop, I have faith that you will know their responsibility because here it was the police during the houses that were in the roads as well as transferring some of the infrastructure for the week and to relocate some of the infrastructure for the week.
When I went back to humble when you were infected with a team?
