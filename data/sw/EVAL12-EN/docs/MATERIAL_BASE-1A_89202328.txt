He went up to the youth.

Ivo Mapunda who is the former captain of Tanzania national team and two clubs in the country, Simba and Yanga, has decided to return his ability on the field by building small youths for the purpose of starting his center to develop talents in Kivule-Mwanagati.

Mapunda, who for now did a friendly match since he was left by Azam FC after his short time ended, he has been at home since the start of this season of VPL 2016-17.

The goalkeeper who got to play soccer in the clubs of Ethiopia and Kenya before going back to Tanzania has said, the aim of starting that center is to help the youths who do not have job opportunities and maybe it's an opportunity to get employment through their talents.

"I have prepared the opening of my sports center, it will be called Teacher Mapunda Sports Center, it is a station that will use small youths from 5 to 18 years and this has been a problem to youths to get employment to small children because it has become a problem to youths to get employment and areas of playing," says that former Taifa Stars goalkeeper, got into the position of Simba and Yanga at different times.

"In the area that among them, I have seen many youths who have no activities to do now, I have decided to change this center to give them an opportunity to show their talents and I expected to start an official opening on November 26th this year, on Saturday the next Saturday," clarified Mapunda, who has said that station will be located in Mwanagati.

"The procedure of how to join you will be known as the same day, together with other other things."

Since he completed his contract with Azam, he has not expected to retire from playing soccer but maybe he decided to retire from playing soccer without announcing.
