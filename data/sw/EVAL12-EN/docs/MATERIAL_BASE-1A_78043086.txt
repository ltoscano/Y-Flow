Advice to Agness Mgongo when he left the net on the 29th minute, a position that was done in Mara is going on with the age continues to go.

For someone who has emerged to a normal life like Agnetta, without doubt that the good position he made when he would have a right time to live in education or business and it's a long time to live in the land of Madiba with every kind of development without doing anything for development.

But the truth of our reporter to be treated well, even if it has got a man with Pesa like Bakhresa, it is supposed to get a citizen with people who are able to move their lives but I see our colleague has dug in short photos, but we see dizziness in the past.

There are people who use these positions on night and in the afternoon but it did not know more so that there is a language that uses these days even if there are no things we are visiting the countries of people living in life, but also there are things we are visiting the country's countries to deal with the chest.

There are many Tanzanians who have done changes by using the opportunities of visiting the countries of people and to bring change in their lives and the community as a whole, the real example, Swaliatu Msuya and others who are unknown.

We know it is clear that your education is not enough and it does not have a great income to be able to live life without depending on a person, but it's only to fight again, but it will not be able to deal with life or even business.

Luck is not in Mara region.
