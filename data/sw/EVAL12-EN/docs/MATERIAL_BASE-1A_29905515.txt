Dec 80, 2015.

At the same time, President Doctor John Magufuli continued to form his government, on our part we are continuing to keep in mind the distance of various stakeholders in the country in war against corruption in a period of one year back to the past.
We remember the reports that were issued by those stakeholders, should be a private institution or public institutions to be the former lady, political parties and even one politicians, without forgetting the special institutions of political parties.
We have ever heard about the former lover of the Human Rights Center (LHRC) against corruption incidents of corruption in the country, but we have never heard the words of other groups of the professionals to be in universities or other levels of education.
In general, those statements have been issued in different times according to an outbreak of corruption cases, starting with illegal immigrants in foreign countries, corruption of billions of dollars from the foreign affairs of Tanzania or one of the corruption of Tegeta Escrow account.
These statements are supported by the great force of the public against the few people, the noise from getting into a high level to an extent that some of the government leaders find themselves in blood pressure, although there is another time the wind of blood has been infected.
At the moment, the situation is to see for these previous days of the fifth term government of President Doctor John Magufuli on our part, at least we have been expecting the efforts of Magufuli and his fellow leaders to deal with the wave of corruption to be supported by stakeholders who were previously.
You can be happy to show that there are still more efforts or otherwise, but against him, it is surprising to see many reports of those stakeholders did not mention them, I think some of their statements did not see those actions.
