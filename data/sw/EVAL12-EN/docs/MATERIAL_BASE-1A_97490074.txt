The residents of Dar es Salaam have made a call on testing their health to an extent of causing floods at the Mnazi Mmoja Grounds.

Those people continued to have gathered even when they were told that number more than 1000 shillings have reduced and therefore forcing a number to be given to reach those fields today.
Speaking about that challenge, the head of that province, Paul Makonda said the crowd of citizens who reached are different from had anticipated.
"We thank us because they have made our call and come out to them in plenty, they are depending on the time they had come, but the challenge facing the number one and they will be required to come tomorrow (today)," said Makonda.
He emphasized that a total of 10 diseases are tested in those fields including diabetes, breast cancer, male gland cancer, breast cancer, heart and that it is permission to look for all diseases in general.
On his part, Doctor Freddy Maro said that the aim of that campaign is to urge the citizens to have a procedure of testing their health since the health of the residents of Dar es Salaam will not be safe for 100 percent.
He said that there are more than 70 doctors who are providing services to those two days and that the ones that will be found with problems will be taken to hospital as usual.
A resident of Vingunguti, Anna Useni (62) said that he went to test the kidney because his legs was married immediately together with blood pressure to be high.
Furthermore, he said that the campaign is good because the medical services in the existing hospitals are expensive, but the government is giving that opportunity for free in order for many people to realize those diseases.
