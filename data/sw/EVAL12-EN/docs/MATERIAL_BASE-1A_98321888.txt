An ancient attack was reduced.
And a picture.
The police officers in the area of Cindy, Egwaga said that if we shall begin the investigation on claims that one man was a resident of that area, he refused to confirm the death of her father while with the aim of removing his property.
The villagers claim that Omari Glawogger who is 42 years old, made a fake certificate of his father's death in 23 years before his father came back.
My fellow musician, Abdalla Mutabunga said that Omari took many property of their father including touching the plot and his house after succeeding to destroy the documents.
He added that after the true death of her father last year, his family would not be able to get his wealth because Omari had gone after launching a fake certificate which is claimed that the father went to the world in the year 1991.
"That was the announcement of death last year after the death of our father, we stopped the documents that he died from 23 years ago and his property will be given our brother," explained Mister Pengo.
