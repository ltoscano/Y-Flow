Fanaticism can sign poverty of poverty.

I remember that when we are in primary schools, we were saying that if we get all the three enemies, the nation was a must for every student to get pregnant for our country.
Why I have said that we have three enemies.
For example, parliamentary candidate is using all his time to recognize and leave the CCM candidate because he does not have a house, that he went to study in America, it is American, that if elected president will go to America.
The false claims has been sold at the fact, instead of the candidate explaining the policies and notice of his party is using a lot of time insulting each other, there are no one who would like to inform them, there are no one who would like to deal with the victims of this disease with other victims like the orphans and widows.
The drugs for reducing the cost of AIDS are offered for the donations from outside the country and the day after tomorrow and the day after tomorrow we have already confirmed that there is no candidate who explained how his party will give them out of poverty, but not to stop poverty, but it must have the strategies to remove those poverty.
The surprising thing is that how people are silent and to listen to only those who do not live in the campaign meetings.
The nation that still people have died in cholera, needs a leader who has hurt them with us because we are still continuing to witness this disease whose cause is wrong when you want to have a lot of cleanliness, but still people have died from this disease whose great medicine is clean.
If people had been not poor, it has been no poor, it has not been able to sell his right to vote for two hundred thousand shillings per two kilograms of sugar, if people would have enough education and to know the importance of electing representatives, if they can be afraid that if it is the foundation that he wants to choose a lot of poverty.
