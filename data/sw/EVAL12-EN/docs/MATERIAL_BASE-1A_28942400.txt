The Head Coach of Yanga, Hans Van Pluijm has said that it's losing the game against Stand United but we have to leave behind those results because it didn't change again.

Yanga got the first win this season of 1-0 in the game against Stand United that was played at the CCM Stadium in Shinyanga at the end of last week.
Speaking with this newspaper yesterday, Pluijm said that those results have left and now they have its strength in the following games so as to change the good results including the Simba at the end of this week.
"We have no joy to the results that we were getting to Stand United, it is supposed to prepare well to change our results to give you," he said.
Speaking about the next game against Simba, he said that if they need to play the international tournament, it is a must to have good results.
He said he knows Simba but he has no fear that, because it is a must that the team failed in which they are planning to take three points.
Coach Pluijm said that they are required to do it is for players to play in themselves and put aside an issue that he has been insisting on his players immediately after time not only in the game but all the games.
The Yanga squad is expected to put in Pemba camp to prepare for that game that will be played on Saturday at the National Stadium, Dar es Salaam.
That match is important for all teams because Yanga will need victory so as to go back to the line in the race to defend his title while Simba wanted the victory so as to be able to contest for the first crown after four years.
Yanga is in the third position in the league standings with 10 points while Simba led by 16 points with Stand United in the second position with 12 points.
