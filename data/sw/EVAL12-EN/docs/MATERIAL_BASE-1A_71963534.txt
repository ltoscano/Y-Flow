A new year without change!
May 30th, 2012

Three weeks ago, we are happy about the new year of 2009, our joy was accompanied by new hope.
Those plans were stuck on last year, are happy about the new year while knowing how to complete that plans.
There's no one who had a lot of passengers, or the person involved with his fellow problems.
But the previous results in the beginning of this year are saying that we are not ready to invest enough in our expectations, especially the expectations of reducing or to eradicate road accidents.
Inside this three weeks, we have lost brothers, relatives, and our friend who we missed the new year with joy.
We have been suffering from road accidents, Tanga Province and in other areas of the country, have died on time in order to make their efforts to look for private development and the nation.
As a result of that situation, we do not know that we are a good citizen is that, we have come in a new year when our thoughts in controlling the road accidents are going on in the past years.
We are inside the new year without having new thoughts in accordance with the road accidents, passengers and drivers have continued to be the source of road accidents.
The organs of the state agencies are in the previous year, this is not yet confirmed because of accidents that happened in the beginning of this year.
A big part of those accidents is a high speed and this is a reason that is inside the capacity of a driver together with passengers.
We thank the passengers, drivers and executives in our country to see that the nation without people should be zero and they should remember that this bridge had a series of hours especially that are not a nation to be proud of.
In the year 2009, passengers, drivers and media stations have to make sure we become a small number of road accidents in East Africa, South Africa and even in Africa, we can be really appropriate.
