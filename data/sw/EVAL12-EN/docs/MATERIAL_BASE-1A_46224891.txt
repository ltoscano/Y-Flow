We are proud to be the prisoners here in this Stars?
I have been very happy and removed from Tanzania in the African finals in the next year, I know that Tanzania's soccer is low than Egypt, but every year we are not there.
It is sad, then it was closed, the coach says that we have no experience, now why should they be found if there is no longer.
Since that experience is found?
It's very much, every day they know our weakness in the national stadium, we would like to see the ball, we love Taifa Stars to be satisfied with how he will not see me.
The players are required to increase so much, they are required to arrive at the international tournament, that is since 1980 until today 36 years, it gets so much together with the TFF to continue with them.
