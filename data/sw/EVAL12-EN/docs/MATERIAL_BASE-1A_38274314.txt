If you sell in security agencies it should be emphasized in order to prevent more disaster in the country.
The brutal killings of more than 70 people in the Mpand ward area, he from Lamu Island have been killed more than open.
Instead of great steps were taken by the security forces to deal with weapons and destruction of weapons and heads of government started being faced with opposition politicians.
Since the attack occurred where 67 people were killed by the terrorists of Al Shabaab several things have been made to strengthen security.
It is a shame to the officers who are involved with security especially the investigation department to be taking action as a result of dealing with these terrorists.
If it is true that involved in this attack is the terrorists of Al Shabaab's main question which will need to be dealt with by leaders of the security sector where how can I get in Ngwala without being found.
Also, another question that will need to be listened to is why it is seen to get in the security unit even the terrorists should not be emphasized.
I call on the government to increase great weapons like those used by weapons.
