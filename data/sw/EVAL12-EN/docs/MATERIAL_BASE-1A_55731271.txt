The case that was found with the elephants' tusks worth 54 billion, between China citizens, Yang Feng Glan, famous as "queen of elephants' elephants' and his colleagues is expected to start being heard on October 5th, this year.

Resident magistrate, Huruma witness, said this yesterday at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate Court, when that case was mentioned.
Previously, the senior lawyer of the government, Faraja Nchimbi claimed that the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) has presented a permit for allowing the court of Kisutu to listen to the case against the economy.
DPP has given that permit because it was legal, the Kisitu court does not have the authority to listen to cases that are heard in the High Court.
A resident magistrate was postponed that case up to October 5th this year, because of bringing to them the previous explanations, together with starting to listen to the case.
Apart from Glan, others, the others are a citizen of Tanzania Salomon Kalou, (39) and Deusdedit Moshi (39), all are accused of four mistakes.
It is alleged to have involved business persons of local governments, 9706 percent of the elephants' tusks worth 2889 billion shillings, 54 trillion shillings, property of the United Republic of Tanzania.
