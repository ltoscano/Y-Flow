It's not a lady, but his man, my friend, a lady of church, will lead Kabende to be in his brother I would like to give him a gift.

My love and it's not in her meaning, it is very true that before her sister did not make her good things, I believe it was not late and you're not your son.

In the way God has decided to go back, I don't know what made you want to tell me.

I am saying that a saying of 'patient hurts me' did not see me when I heard her sister and a joke to him.

Friends, I love and is still a small man, but the desire for her sister have taken another chapter.

There were a easy way to get a young man to get her sister, but now her sister was used to it well.

Until now I urge you for my phone number not enough, he decided that it will be enough for me, he wants to be with me without knowing if I have goals and her brother.

I don't know my dreams, I am in a very difficult time I don't know how I don't know her sister and I don't know how I will give her and they will give him a house and they will be sitting on one house.

Friends Eme!

I have died from a lady and a girl in the country, I have not yet answered anything that I have done in communication for some time so as to reflect on them.

Why do it mean to thank God.

By the name Dudumizi.
