The delegation of Paul Kagame to Jakaya Kikwete, are for the for CCM.

The important message to the President Jakaya Kikwete heading to the general elections!

"Insisted about democracy, it is one thing and managing democracy is another thing, just like countries, members of the East African Community are following up what is going on in Tanzania during the general elections, therefore, we have the desire to see our friend and our chairman in Tanzania so as to prevent me or passport.

If you agree with Paul Kagame on behalf of his fellow leaders of East Africa, I think Jakaya Kikwete is supposed to encourage the way democracy to be implemented here in Tanzania?
