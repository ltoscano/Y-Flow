I was heard of 12 September 2016.

The union of the Tanzania People's Association (CUF) branch of the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM), has advised the former chairman of the party, Professor Ibrahim Lipumba to leave that party.

The report that was released today by the chairman of the community, Mohd Chande has said there is a plan to disrupt the party being done by Professor Lipumba and warned them to stop buying their reputation and put aside the honor that he had given many years in the community and outside the country.
He added that he is doing Professor Lipumba, it's not only that you hurt me or disgraced me with him, but they bought the whole community of scholars and status as he is.
"It is easy to see someone like Professor Lipumba who was the first position in the national position, today I will be on the front line to cause conflicts and causing them to respect the legal action of the party and not for its personal interests," he said.
That report has condemned the violence and statements that are continuing to be released by Professor Lipumba and some of his followers, like the former deputy secretary general of CUF Tanzania Mainland, Magdalena Sakaya to be a division in the mainland and island Tanzania.
That report has also requested the executive council and other authorities of that party to continue doing a difficult decision to rebuild the party when there is need, because the basis and procedures of the party must be followed.
