The Provincial Commissioner of Kilimanjaro, Said Meck Sadiki has emphasized on the implementation of the development projects in the district councils as a result of being built under the level because of lack of management keenly.

Sadiki said that when he was inspecting the construction of two classrooms at the SB Primary School, and the construction of irrigation project in the Sokomatola area which will serve more than 3,000 citizens in an village in Mwanga district.
He said the construction of those houses and 24 pit latrines will use more than 86 million shillings from the office of the Regional Administration and Local Government (Tamisemi), have several factors among them being unable to marry off due to the poor.
"The managing director of using this contractor, make sure that you follow up for a period of three months to use the project, are used to fill in the rainy season, are used to come out even before the students started using these classrooms," he said.
The executive director of that council, Golden Mgombeni with the acting chairman of the council, Rajab Luhwavi, said the provincial commissioner that those classes that were built by Tanzania Company or construction will not be received as it will be low level.
He said Tamisemi was built 50 million shillings for the purpose of two classrooms and 36 million shillings for construction of 24 machines for toilets, because students were using toilets for classrooms during a period of classrooms, something that is not safe.
Speaking about the project of Kunzugu Ward, he said that it aims to serve the farmers, farmers and ordinary citizens where up to now, have been used to 700 million shillings from the Japan International Agency (JICA).
