This issue of the provincial heads / the district to capture the holiday is to put the disabled deaf and he has said that it is a violation of the law!

Sihana, supported by I, who registered to support the statements of the provincial heads of Tanga and Kilimanjaro to cancel ownership of public servants for every year of December without being given legal measures against all civil servants, who are not treated with their holidays that are there in accordance with the law.

The head of district to put public servants from a sentence, without any correct instructions is the symptoms of the political administration, he doesn't know that every leader can make sure, you cannot get someone for several hours without a result of any legal explanation!

There has been a habit that is going against the ethics of public service of leaders to provide guidelines and that are not involved in the best administration with an aim and they saw the other in the popular list!

We are required that people come out to work together, we want people to be accountable because we do not do so by using the repressive system that I see it is ready to see that because people follow the procedures, regulations and ethics of the public service!

During the time of President Kikwete, there is Dictatorship (C) to cater for 12 strokes and when I think we should not understand what we have already confirmed that we have already agreed to be a democratic country and I want to go after the rule of administration.

We have seen that Zanzibar someone is looking for elections contrary to the procedures that are supporting them because they are signs of very bad administration, I request it should be understood that I don't support the theft or laziness or not to be used by legal laws!
