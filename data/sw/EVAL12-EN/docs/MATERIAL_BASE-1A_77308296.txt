The chairman of the board of directors of the clean water and Environment Authority in Tanga Province (Tanga), Salum Shamte has said that the authority is in the final stages of handing over 100 meters for payment of payments.

The implementation of the strategy has said that it will enable the authority to deal with the current problem facing some of the customers including a lot of customers who don't like to pay their differences on time.
He made that statement yesterday at a ceremony to launch the new board of directors and farewell to delegates who had completed their term that took place at the Tanga headquarters office UWASA at Mwananyamala Hospital in the city.
He said through that procedure, the authority will be able to save the money that were piled up by the customers especially institutions and public organizations.
"Up to the end of August this year, our authority claims different institutions including public institutions, worth more than two billion shillings and I believe that we will stop these payments for payments before together with other things to be filled with this problem facing the face," he said.
Earlier, the Executive Director of Tanga UWASA, Joshua Nasari, said that together with various achievements they received, the authority continues to fight the environment that comes from human activities together with the shortage of clean water.
