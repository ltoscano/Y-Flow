He said that the company has been forced to leave the production of agricultural tools that was happening at the factory before the government emphasizes on corruption due to the cost of the production of those equipment being high compared to the market needs in line with the price.
He said the company has decided to focus on the production of electricity prices of cement because the current plan of TANESCO was to stop the use of trees in trees that has been causing the production of environment, already the factory has started production, it is needed by Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) to confirm the quality of those iron sheets.
