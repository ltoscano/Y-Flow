Judgment that identified himself and put pictures on the internet September 20.

It has been written by me.

I was published today 14th September 2016.

The District Court of Ilala, has planned on September 20 this year, to read the judgment of being faced by sending pictures on the social media that is facing Mister Richard Mwaikenda (31) and Juma Richard (31).

The government's lawyer, James Mtayakingi Kilaba said that the court yesterday that the case was mentioned for the judgment and that the charges were ready to listen to that judgment.
However, the senior resident magistrate of that court, Said Mkingie has postponed that case up to September 20 this year, because he did not complete that judgment.
The charges of charges in that case stopped the evidence of bringing four witnesses together with the illustrations, including the pictures of the event, where later they will be found with a case to answer him on him.
According to the charges of charges, August 23, 2014, at the Maasais' and the White House Hotel in Ilala district, Dar es Salaam, they found her husband's wife who claimed to be the wife to Kassim Majaliwa's wife who claimed to be the wife of Kassim Majaliwa.
As a result of that situation, the Kenyans had identified himself, to give each one that they have had a computer of HP-shirts that will cost 100,000 shillings, the type Techno worth 300,000 shillings and shoes.
It was claimed that after being given those things, he sodomized that photos and broke down the picture with her naked photos and wanted them to receive one million shillings in order to get those pictures on the internet.
However, they are alleged that they had given those pictures on social media in what is claimed that her husband did not give the money that he is required.
