Tanzania Telecommunication Company Limited (TTCL), has started providing reliable communication services to engineers that do work in non-communication areas so as to enable them to implement their work hard.

The Executive Director of the new services of TTCL, Yellow Fanga, said this at the end of the week at the 14th general meeting of engineers that took place in the city.
He said that TTCL is ready to help in providing communication in areas that have no normal communication system in the country.
"TTCL will ensure it gives communication even in areas that have no normal communication system by closing special equipment that are helping the companies to do communication in the working areas," he said.
He added that engineers are doing research and communication outside the country thus causing reliable communication while all of them are not at work.
"In the sea in the streets that are not communication, TTCL has come with answers for engineers in those areas, we can give them internet communication by using mobile phones, which are following special equipment that will help them to get communication in the relevant area," said he said.
National Communications Manager, Nsemo Kiango, said engineers are given great opportunity of using the network and its benefits to their activities.
He urged them to use a vibrant station for improving information (Data Center) run by TTCL in order to save their information on security.
