NEC is the results of presidential votes we need to be written in the stations to ensure they sell their skills of votes.

The National Electoral Commission (NEC) has said that from now it will start producing presidential results at the polling stations in the general elections of this year so as to increase transparency and reduce complaints on theft.

That plan has been made by the chairman of National Electoral Commission, retired Judge Damian Lubuva, when he spoke to religious leaders in Dar es Salaam city, who told him that argument being one of the criteria that will complete that process in peace and harmony and satisfied candidates and followers of the parties.

He said that despite being written in the stations, the broadcasting of results will be done as usual in every level, councilor seat in the ward, parliamentary and presidential elections.

Judge Lubuva said he was quoted in the past saying that "there is no need to have doubt in preparing the youth in protecting the stations. There will be no chance because all votes will be counted at the spot.

"Everyone will know the councilor that when you get how many votes will have a member of parliament and even the president who voted for them and counted at the district where other people believe it will be changed," he said.
