Lindi province has given a loan of more than 50 million shillings to six groups of entrepreneurship so as to promote business.
While handing over the loan, the District Commissioner of Lindi, Yahaya Semboja wants the entrepreneurs to use as intended so as to reach the government's goals to fight poverty.
Mwakipesile asked me of the entrepreneurs to restore those loans in time so that they can be able to bring in other groups of entrepreneurs.
He urged the citizens, especially the youth to use the opportunities that are available to improve economically instead of winning the village and agreed there is no employment.
The acting manager of SIDO in Lindi region, Salma Ali said 49 entrepreneurs from those groups have been given 58 million shillings to strengthen their capital and stop poverty.
Salma said together with SIDO, the loans are still faced with various challenges including the aim of failing to implement the agreement on time.
