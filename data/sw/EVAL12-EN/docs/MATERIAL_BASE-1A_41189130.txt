Simba, leaving the coach to do his registration.
I was coming out to this Citizen newspaper with my few things and more about the registration being done by Simba and even other clubs in the premier league.
For some time now, I've heard the coaches of Manchester City, Pep Guardiola is all the whole world to hold registration.
Jose Pickup, who was born with Manchester United and he is happy for the purpose of registration, those who don't want to play or he was playing with them there where they were starting to leave.
But the greatest job for registering him is for him because he is taking a player to be in his plans and it is holding the committee and it is not a player and he does not want a player for its plans but this is the only thing for Tanzania.
Now if they are self-employed, the coach has said that these are not in his plans, how will it be?
Let Simba stop peace, if a player is doing his things.
Mohamed Rukara, Dar es Salaam City.
