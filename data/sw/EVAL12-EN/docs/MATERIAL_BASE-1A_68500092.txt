The government has been requested to hold over students from the field of medicine so that they can be able to help each other and help them in the provision of correct medicine for patients.

While speaking yesterday in the city in the city of Geology, the President of the Association of Human Resources of Tanzania (PST), Michael Kishiwa said that currently the number of medicine is big, but the medicine experts including those of drugs are 1,200 shillings, a step that contributes to the availability of service providers who do not have reputation.
He said that due to the lack of experts, there have been a big challenge of some of those who give medicine for ethics and others to work on drugs, are very worried about, a situation that is dangerous to human health.
Kishiwa said that the greatest job of their party is to ensure that it affects the quality of medicine service and managing ethics, so that the citizens can get correct drugs and use them as required.
"But in order to reduce this challenge, it is good that the government allowed the skilled students in the field of medicine and drug abuse, so as to prevent each other to control these services without education," he said.
The Provincial Commissioner of Arusha, Mrisho Gambo opening the conference on behalf of the minister of policy, parliament, labor, youth, employment and disabled, Jenista Mhagama said the government in ensuring Tanzanians get better services of medicine, it has started improving the policies of starting the medicine industry in the country.
