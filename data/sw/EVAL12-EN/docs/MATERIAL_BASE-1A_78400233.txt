The head of Kinondoni District, John Mongella has called on people with special groups including the disabled women because they have been able to come out in large numbers to give their opinion about the creation of the new constitution when the members of the commission while in that province.
Omari giving a report.
Mister Mongella has made that call in Moshi town during a brief ceremony to hand over twenty-governmental equipment for people with disabilities donated by the youth through the revolutionary party in Singida province, Catherine Kiyemba.
Mister Mongella said that it is the only opportunity for those residents to come out and give their views about the start of a new constitution.
On the eighth.
On the ten and ten years.
The commission of collecting opinions for the performance will be used to make new constitution that will be in the city of Durban in order to come out.
Go to give our opinion.
The constitution of the country is the law.
It is not all.
The law, Catherine Mwageni who is also the member of parliament for youths in Arusha province, says the aim of the donation is to ease the people with disabilities who have been facing various challenges to use those drugs to arrive in other areas on time due to the Sumbawanga Region.
Dealing with women they were in the department of this province, each day when I was called on different ways, it was going back to ensure that there is need for everyone to ask for himself.
By considering the different articles, it is called for our colleagues that if they were being thrown as other people have been satisfied and they should continue to help you because the situation that we have is not good.
From the city where I was looking for OMR, captain.
