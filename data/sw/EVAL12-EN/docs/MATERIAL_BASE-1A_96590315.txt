The residents of seven villages in Zongomela Area, the rural areas have requested the government to identify roads from one voter to go, so that they have been given our journalist and Burundi to visit those villages, a matter that has been issued to them by the acting director of the Council of Directors, Selemani Semunyu.
The vehicle is determined for one ten years only when it comes up when the availability of success has come to a lot of success which concern town we are directed to sit on the law.

Today I have heard.
I have seen it?
In Europe, very much because that is also when we get a problem here, let him listen to your studies at four minutes, the director of the strengthening the villages, Selemani said that you can't identify the road not and sees no one who used to keep in mind two and ten thousand in the road.
For the two thousand year, I told me that the road was beaten by roads but put aside from malaria, a total of one hundred million shillings.
And I use that the contractor to look for.
Your friend, Teddy.
