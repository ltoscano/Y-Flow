We are safe and I'm in safe, we have made a meeting with the public that you're very much and it's not the ones I have lost their lives and those who have found you have never happened because we had to end the activity we will do.
They are saying it is eight people.
The late God rest his eight people at the field of Dar es Salaam.
Now the Lord does not see what we will go to see then we should know who we are about, there are those who need them.
There are those who can know your ones that they were in that bus then the Almighty God is not only one thousand people, the late God is known as required.
Your people are safe and she does not have gone to.
