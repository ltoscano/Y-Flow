The Head Coach of Yanga, Hans Van Pluijm has said that his team has not been expelled as some of the soccer stakeholders claimed and added that time is not long to go back to their quality.

Some of the stakeholders and soccer analysis of soccer in the recent days have been giving their views that Yanga has already gotten tired due to many players who will not get time to rest after coming from the international competition.
Speaking to this newspaper yesterday, Pluijm said that for a long time you will be back again and will happen if the truth has already gotten lost or not.
"It is not true that if we have been arrested, we feel good and for a long time you will see good things, we are continuing to prepare and respect our challenges so that we are doing well," he said.
Yanga is coming into a draw of 1-1 goals against Simba in the game that was played at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam at the end of last week.
The results have been banned from the third position up to five with 11 points same as Azam FC who will hold the sixth position but Yanga being behind one game.
The teams that are leading four best is Simba with 17 points, Stand United 15, Mtibwa Sugar and Kagera Sugar with 12 points.
That squad started exercises the day before yesterday at the Kurasini Police stadium to fall in the next game against Ruvu Shooting.
Still, that team and Simba have been trying to look for their home ground, after the nation was defeated by using it following the violence that arose in their last game.
