The Pastor of the New Life Church, which is in Shinyanga municipality, Godfrey Msuha has said he was surprised by some people who call the servants of God to lack ethics and find them to be the source of evil actions, instead of informing them.

While speaking to this newspaper, Pastor Jairo said that the servants of God are required to maintain love and peace, but some of them have been going against them and give them money and put it money.
He said he has been surprised by some of the workers and various religious leaders to lack the fear of God, instead they have been doing the evil thing that is diggers while they are supposed to accompany him.
"Some of the leaders have been doing their work ethics and to us instead of knowing love, they have been doing evil things inside him which is bad, good relations and small girls not to put money," he said.
He said some of the workers of God have been not faithful in their marriages that is why many actions have already been allowed, to participate in marriage acts and girls who are small, while others get pregnant.
"When they are in the stations they are required to have an example to show their hearts of serving the people with love and rebuke any acts of evil actions and ensure that they get married," he said.
