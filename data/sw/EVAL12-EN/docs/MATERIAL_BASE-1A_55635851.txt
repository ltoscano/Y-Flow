EPOS should not vie for the workers.
The commission of ethics and fighting corruption (EPOC) had a letter to the representatives of Muembe Makundi Ward, he said that in that old, they were known as T, he said that in old, they were known as councilors.
That letter is warned those representatives that the one in the danger of being evicted, if they will improve the behavior of 'Views' as such as usual.
In addition, he mentioned other people to involve in any evil deeds without being evidence, and who will give information about the kind they will be required before Eucharist in England.
That letter was presented to the Kongwa council of Nairobi, already it has already been condemned by the representatives of Muembe Makundi Ward, who are saying that the commission affects their freedom to explain without fear.
The freedom of explaining, it is a human rights for everyone in accordance with the fourth album of the constitution, therefore there is no one with the authority nor the ability to remove it even so, in that chapter, there is a must that you need for accountability.
What the Eucharist is doing is to prevent the behavior which I have attached with ethics of people representing the citizens, that is why it is called the commission of ethics and fighting corruption.
The ethics of many leaders of the main government and the ones that he said they have a shortage of people they do such actions that they affect the people who came to them.
There has been a lot of politicians to throw chairs and break the public property and even to bring about fear among those citizens.
Therefore, Eme C are supposed to continue with this law to all public leaders so that the commission has a responsibility of educating the citizens about the importance of electing people with ethics.
It should not be a leadership that is set aside through a huge explosion.
