The Union of Youth of the Revolutionary Party (UVCCM) has suspended the work of the former secretary of the union of Arusha, Ezekiel Mollel of not supporting the headquarters of the headquarters that forced him to relocate and cause a tension with conflicts and productivity for CCM in Arusha province.

That union has urged the UVCCM youth to recognize that the activities of running that union are being held by following procedures of discipline by considering the foundation of discipline and obedience.
The acting secretary general of UVCCM, Shaka Hamdu Shaka has told the journalists at the UVCCM offices in the province after completing conflict that had emerged and caused some youths to wed in the office and wanted Ezekiel to continue to remain in Arusha province.
Doubt, he said on August 25, this year, the headquarters put him a letter, Mollel made him to return to Dar es Salaam city, but there is no wonder for all the time he has been trying to leave for his personal reasons.
He has said that the session of the National Housing Corporation in Dar es Salaam city, September 14, this year, has decided to suspend him from that secretary and wanted them to support the new secretary of the new region, Said Meck Sadick, Arusha from Lindi.
When he was asked if it is a plan to dismiss him so as to resolve the truth about the availability of projects, he said that leaving, it could not prevent a fact that it should not be known, because the community is making investigation on projects and resources and government agencies have been asked for the scandal to get the truth of issues.
