A report to the press.

The defense force of the citizens of Tanzania has already been aired by disappointment about the report of a person who identified himself as JWTZ officers of Monduli District, Arusha, that was published in the Citizen newspaper on December 24, 2012 while wearing a draw of TDPF.

After seeing this information that JWTZ makes a comprehensive investigation so as to recognize that the person is true and it is not true that the name of the person has not been written, secondly, the real squad of the person has not been written, but the real squad of the person has not been shown because it is a great draw of TDPF.

It was easy to recognize the person by looking at the face, but the person alleged to be a soldier displaying the forehead what action will be taken due to the regulations of defense forces since the year 1992, article four (3), any suspect should not be involved in political issues.

If it was explained above, the defense force of the citizens of Tanzania has been sworn in for that picture because there is no benefit or benefits to the citizens of Tanzania more than encouraging citizens to look for this issue keenly, to the security of our country.

It has been released by the Director of Information and Relations at the headquarters of the force, Upanga in L9203, phone of 764 711423,87114212,046.
