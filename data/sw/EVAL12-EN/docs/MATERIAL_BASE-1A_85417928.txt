Let him pass.

This or what does or look for a lot of strength in an easy language or it will be supported through a funeral but Yanga also did your close to singing because such a lady had a sides to know, this was a must inside this hall.

In the Mount Meru Hotel here, he completed himself as my friend, I thank the Almighty God to see my listeners as the late Margaret Tsehai said without forgetting me, so that we know true.

For allowing the Ambassador I have ever done, I believe that even those players of Simba and Yanga this topic should follow up on the air, they will be able to learn that every time we can have high risks, but this journey has not been able to give birth because this journey has not been looking for excuses that you know it.

In general, as a lot of time, if you miss a lot of time we shouldn't leave each other day because in this period you missed the road and also the leadership of this college in Mount Meru to go.
It's just a good time when you look at different ways you need.
