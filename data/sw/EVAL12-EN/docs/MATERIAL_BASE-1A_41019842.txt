Man City without having defeated Leicester.
Leicester's former coach Manuel Pellegrini has told his youth to use their victory in the middle of the week against Roma as the motivation to serve Leicester.
Manchester City emerged victorious with 2-0 goals against Roma on Wednesday and qualify for the best 16 matches of the European Champions League (UEFA).
But now Coach Manuel Pellegrini has expressed his thoughts in the premier league championship.
That coach has said that he will continue to give Chelsea the pressure that are in front of three points.
"We have already completed the champions league and now we have no fear and now it is time to target the premier league," said Pellegrini.
"We don't have four matches to play this month and all of them are important so that we continue to go with Chelsea.
"P-Square is heading to the matches which have 12 points in a total." Even so, we will have Manchester to play those matches without their striker Sergio Busigara, who is outside six weeks due to a knee injury.
Pellegrini has already been seen to have a strong squad after beating Roma without Akitanda, who until now has scored 19 goals.
"Success is important for us as if Cristiano Ronaldo as Real Madrid and Lionel Messi and Lionel Messi's important player but we can play without him."
