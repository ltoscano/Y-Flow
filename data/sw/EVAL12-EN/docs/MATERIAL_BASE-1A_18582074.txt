The government has announced a new price of oil.
And how about her birthday.
The operators of vehicles have been sent away after the spread of the international oil prices, according to the commission for electricity prices (ERC).
The Executive Director of ERC, Mister Gerson Lwenge, said that electricity of the Super Mega period will be reduced by 4998 shillings, while the price of fuel will be reduced by 142 shillings, equivalent to 1000 shillings per liter.
In those new prices, that will start being implemented today up to October 14th, the operators of Mombasa will they buy a Super Mega period of 107,928 per liter, while those in Nairobi were forced to pay approximately 1 trillion shillings.
Diesel will be sold at 30,000 dollars per liter of Mombasa and 102236 shillings in Nairobi.
Mister Miskry said that situation has been caused by a reduction in prices of buying oil from foreign countries.
"The price of petrol will be taken by 697 percent from 1,06674 dollars for every tons it was in July to 1,001,422 dollars.
"In that period, the price of oil has been reduced by 345 percent of 75 million dollars per month of July 2012 to 967,888 trillion shillings per August, 2014, while Ugali, equivalent to 928,923 million dollars for every month of August," he said.
He warned the sale of oil against the improvement of the oil price that was given by that commission because it will be an error in the law.
