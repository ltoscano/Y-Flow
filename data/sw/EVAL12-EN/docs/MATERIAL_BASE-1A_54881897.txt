The government through the Ministry of Information, Youth, Culture and Sports have had a ten million shillings to the family of the late Steven Kanumba, the deputy minister for information, culture, and sports Amos Makalla will hand over Ben has handed over those funds to the mother of the late Steven Kanumba and told artists that the process of protecting several people is taking place.
Use only signing on behalf of the government.
There is a problem.
When he was handing over houses, we're happy to do a shame, if the ten million government we were talking on how.
It is supposed to us because of security but I think that many youths of the women of Steve will protect the mother also known.
For the purpose of this game, we think that we give a cake to the step of saying that fake phones will be found.
But I believe that if we go to go, we want to be safe, we will be safe to be a video.
Administration, the government and the concerned ministry could not be commanded?
I don't have to say though the Kanumba comes back but I have been happy so much the government I thank you and therefore I thank you so much, I thank you so much for you to bless you for every more time.
