In the normal state, the local government elections in the country has been happening in one year before the annual general election, this election has been supervised by the office of the prime minister, regional administration and local governments.
The government is with the preparations and called this election, different from the situation is at least the general elections which were supervised by the National Electoral Commission which however, and also its senior officials are the results of the president of the United Republic of Tanzania, although it is in accordance to the constitution.
Maybe a difference of several elections that has ever happened to the local government levels, this year has come out a different environment that will have been directed by the process of getting a new constitution that is going on April this year, that is for more than six months until the end of the current constitution and the structure of administration authorities in the country.
Contrary to the expectations, the new constitution has been planned to be available on time that was organized by delegates of the special assembly of the constitution that have been added time to discuss so as to discuss the constitution because the state of the constitution is not known especially that election will not be known especially the election will not be known.
During the trap, already the senior leaders in the country have given different statements that are not aware because the uncertainty over that election for local government's elections, President Jakaya Kikwete has made a statement saying that election depends on the trend of the new constitution process, President Jakaya Kikwete, who has made a statement saying that the decision by the prime minister, who is the authority to supervise the local government elections.
On the other side, we believe it is great mistakes for senior leaders of the country at the level of President and the prime minister to provide information that can make great victory to the party, especially considering that it is difficult to separate the interests of President Kikwete between his presidential position and that of the office of the Prime Minister and his interests as a member of the executive committee of CCM.
Therefore, we are making sure that all the senior leaders of the government should know that the issue of local government elections is not an issue of political parties with the aim of participating in elections between those parties with the aim of making a good working environment for the ruling party.
