Ngassa is still a problem of lack.

Last season of the Tanzania Mainland Premier League, Yanga were defending champions and they used more than 40 million people to register three players who are a goalkeeper Juma Kaseja who has paid 30 million shillings to the striker Emmanuel Okwi that cost 180 shillings, million.

But it has been faced with a disaster of its kind, it has been unable to defend his championship and to do his great winger who is Mrisho Ngassa to write a fashion record together with championship of the Mainland Premier League for five consecutive years.

Currently, Mrisho Ngassa joined Azam FC in the year 2010 for a three year contract from Yanga which in that season that ended the championship of the premier league in the year 2009 to 2010 with the record of not losing the game.

The player played for Azam in the 2010 / 2011 season and emerged as the best scorer of the league scoring 18 goals.

But Azam which was not rich as it is now, it did not succeed to win the championship since he completed the third position with his 44 points while Yanga emerged as the champions of the season.

Ngassa continued to play with Azam in his second year of the contract in the year 2011 / 2012 and despite his level being high in that season, his team defeated the second position in the league and Simba SC.

Unfortunately, it was supposed to be bad in Ngassa after being sold by Azam to go to Simba in the season 2012 / 2013 where he was unable to help those robbers and find themselves at the third position while Yanga is a champion.

Misfortunes is not happy during the last season where he joined Yanga, has ended up again with the championship since it has won Azam FC Ngassa in the season with 13 points while Yanga won the second with 56 points while Azam is taking the title for its 62 points.

Mbeya City has ended the third position with 49 points with Simba four points.
