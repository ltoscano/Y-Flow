The Malim Kikwete is on the strike of doctors heading to 28, 2012.

While the strike of doctors continues in the country, the Law and Human Rights Center has forced President Jakaya Kikwete to implement his promise he made at the end of February this year, that the doctors will remain in the country.
In his report to the media that was signed by his executive director, Doctor Hellen Kijo Bisimba, the center has accused the government in general for not being keen in addressing issues of doctors who are in strike.
It has said that the government has not been unable to give information to the public about the commission that was formed between doctors and government concerning the conflict of that conflict.
I wanted the government to ensure that treatment equipment and important drugs in all health centers are available so that all citizens can be able to get better health services.
"The government is required to ensure that it is implementing the Abuja agreements with making sure that it gives 15 percent of its budget in improving health services.
He added, "the government has been continuing to talk about the interests of the doctors without talking about the issue of improving health services and the availability of treatment equipment," the center has urged the government to take legal action of preventing another strike of doctors because the ones who are affected by private hospitals and the ones that are not treated outside the country.
"All the authorities in the country will inform you, to respect and be responsible for the citizens who put him in power according to the 8th article of the constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania," the center said.
I wanted the public to prevent us to wake up and to explain the government that it is responsible for Tanzanians and not to a small group of people who protect their interests.
