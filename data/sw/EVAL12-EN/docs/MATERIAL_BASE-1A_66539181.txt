Youths, women together with the disabled in Oyster Bay area have been urged to borrow the money for doing business at the treasury at the authority.
The chief officer of the youth in that area Mister David Oguda, he said the activities of inspecting the forms presented by various groups will be taken this week.
He said among the conditions that needs to be done by accountability in the groups concerned with the projects they had planned to implement.
He said that groups that will fulfill those requirements will give them an amount of 50,000 shillings to 100,000 shillings.
"There has been a habit of some youths to fear such money despite having been issued for their purpose and I want to sensitize citizens to come out and stop fearing the loans because they are business that will begin for that debt," he said.
The money that have risen to all regions in the country are expected to help improve the lives of those who will benefit by giving them the ability to participate in economic activities.
