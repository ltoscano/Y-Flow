More than 60 children are expected to undergo a heart operation without opening the chest at the Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute (JKCI) that is in Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH).

That operation in the modern way started on September 9, this year, it has been explained that the average of 10 children should not be operated on.
The relations officer of that institution, Maulid Mohammed, said other children are expected from Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
Mohammed said that the operation has started well and to be finished as planned.
He said, "we are the most important among the people from the neighboring countries to follow the service in our institution because of the good services we offer," he said.
He added that six children from Rwanda, Congo and Uganda have already benefited from the heart operation and that it is due to the fact that JKCI is the only institution that gives the modern service in the East African region.
"We are continuing to implement the government's policy to ensure that we benefit from the country, including government leaders.
That will help to save the money that is used for treatment outside the country, "he said.
He said the cost of buying children with a heart problem is eight million shillings compared to the country like India where the cost is 30 million shillings.
Doctor Fauzia Kullane, the Muhimbili National Hospital, said that in the East African Community (EAC), the JKCI institution is the only that gives the service in that region at an affordable price.
He said the patients who came to that institution from Congo are suffering from heart disease and that one has its hole in the heart.
