Yanga head coach, Hans Van Pluijm has said his squad has gone back in his level and now it is a high speed in his left matches.

Yanga won by 3-1 goals against Mtibwa Sugar in the Tanzania Mainland Premier League that was played the day before yesterday at Uhuru Stadium.
Yanga goals in that match were scored by Obrey Chirwa, Simon Msuva, and Donald Ngoma and Mtibwa Sugar was scored by Haruna Chanongo.
Speaking after that match, Pluijm said the level they had bought his players as they will continue with it is clear that they will welcome Simba leading the top.
"The big victory shows that we continue to prepare more than 100 percent in every game to promote the victory, our aim is to come close to Simba on top and to be easy to defend our title," he said.
He said his squad was playing well and in partnership that has enabled them to use well the positions they got in getting.
About Chirwa has released the first time since he did not support the team this season, Pluijm said that the success of success is because he refused to play and believe in him, "I warned him and asked him to believe in the field and that it has been successful," he said.
Yanga's victory has extended the position from the fifth position to four being played with Mtibwa Sugar that was in the third position.
Yanga has now attained 14 points in seven games, behind Kagera Sugar with 15 points in nine games, while Stand United is in the second position with 19 points in nine games and Simba leading the top with 20 points in eight games.
The next game Yanga is expected to play with Azam FC the day after tomorrow, a game that is expected to be difficult because Azam has not seen well in its matches and is out to lost the day before Stand United and therefore will give victory.
