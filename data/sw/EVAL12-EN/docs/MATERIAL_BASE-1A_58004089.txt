The community has asked the government to give birth.

By Stella Manyanya.

Tanzanian Community in the Tanzania branch, has asked the government to look at the possibility of putting a half time in the commemoration of the new year of Islamic State.
Speaking to the Majira newspaper, Sheikh of Dar es Salaam province, Alhad Mussa Salum, said he is collaborating with the community by requesting the government to recognize that day and to make it be the first time.

"I join with this community to request the government to recognize the importance of the new year of Islam and agreed to set aside time, Muslims continue to use Islam in various activities," he said.

He added that the government has an opportunity to recognize the importance of that day and to pay mosques servants by using the crime and insisted that it is a surprising thing to some of the Islamic institutions to fail to follow the date.

"There is still a big challenge to Muslims about the use of Islam so that everyone will help him in many other things of our religion," he said.

The chairperson of the community in that community, Dar es Salaam branch, Mister Rished Bade has said for a long time they requested the government to recognize the importance of that day and agreed to be for a half time.
