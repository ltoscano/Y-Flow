Masaudi, asking to hear the residents of Bongo.
Dodoma.
He is a nominated member of parliament, Gimbi Masaudi, who is looking for the provinces of the Lake Region and this being his first time to enter the box, he has given a stern warning to the year.
That member of parliament has apologized to the residents urging them to reduce vehicles, certificates that destroy the environment in that town.
What is happy to say more is that, he wanted the government to be careful with his statements about the big number of livestock opposing it that it endangers the environment, but it is a plan to reach it.
It's like he was not understood that, the truth is that and what is what he said. If you have heard the people of the country, then you have a way to do if you're running from Mbezi up to Tanzanian shillings by using those vehicles that destroy the environment.
