Yanga match, Coastal Union would be closed down.
I am one of the soccer fans in Tanzania, I was surprised to be followed by the Tanzania Football Federation, TFF getting a win for Yanga while the match was broken because of darkness.
The style of getting victory, where that team is unable to reach far from the international competitions. That game has already been planned and he will go due to the environment.
Basically, if Yanga will be buried, the Coastal Union will be controlled by the referees that they will be avoided, why do this matches have been postponed, because each one has a mistake?
The truth, Yanga has been carried out by TFF for deciding to give the victory and now that plays for Azam FC is not true and it is not true, the match would have been done, but it is not legal because the match had a lot of money.
