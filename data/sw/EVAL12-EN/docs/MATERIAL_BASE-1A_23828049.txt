The police put it well to assume.

The guest of honor at this area who to borrow, there was an entrepreneur but paying it is a habit, he sees no bad injuries after being shot dead by not paying its debts.
Let me say that, when the man stopped the work of teaching so as to make a business that he started but put in shambles.
The people had a habit of borrowing from different people and promised to return them at the end of the month, but he could not fulfill those promises.
It was unable to carry out many being that despite having those debts, the relatives were forced to leave the ones claimed to pay the phone that he promised to pay as a day he promised to pay it.
Recently, he met with a family and relatives of inheritance who has been able to get 500 shillings four months ago but he did not want to pay as it was a woman and that's where his shame started.
"Today's today, you don't know that tomorrow it is a man and it has managed to take my money immediately or even if you tell you that the game that happened for many years and today you will know me," the relatives met with the anger of the rapper.
To write and leave, when I was forced to go to the heavy rains and he knew the parasites.
It is at that time when four other people came out and asking to face the relatives of each one who claimed to be 400 shillings.
One of them did a prayerful person remain if you got her money while his colleagues received him by touching the hearts of his fellow people when he refused to listen to him saying he had a lot of issues for a long time.
By luck, the old man of the village did not know the violence and left, put him in front of the fight.
However, despite that beating, those men who loved the relatives of one month and when he went to spongers to be heard saying the people were heard saying the people were supposed to be the punishment for fear.
