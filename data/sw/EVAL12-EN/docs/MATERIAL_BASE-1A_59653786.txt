Serengeti National Parks (TANAPA) has given out 280 million shillings for the construction of classrooms, houses for teachers, laboratory and clinics in the district of Mara province.

While handing over the donation, the member of parliament of Serengeti, Allen Rwizile said on behalf of the Executive Director of TANAPA, Allan Kijazi, reproductive health manager, Ahmed Olotu, said that the plan is a continuation of contributing development activities in the district.
"From the year 2004 up to now the Serengeti Reserve has implemented 35 development projects worth 2283, 299, therefore the community is required to see the importance of protecting our resources and eventually costs for the organization to fight the crime," said Kijazi.
He said the problems of robbery, conflicts of borders and transporting livestock in the safeguard, increase the organization and caused a huge use of money that can be used to development activities.
Furthermore, he urged the citizens to participate in protecting resources so as to benefit from revenue generated from conservation.
"Through the Serengeti National park, we are supposed to benefit from the construction of roads in different areas that will connect the villages. Councils we recognize that contribution and we will continue to cooperate by involving the community in order to deal with challenges of resources," said Mgongo.
