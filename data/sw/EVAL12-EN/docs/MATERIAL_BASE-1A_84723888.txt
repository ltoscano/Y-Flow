The terrorists is now one.
I put aside illegal immigrants in the country despite the great law of expansion of this year without hesitation and found guilty.
Under those laws of illegal immigrants, they have been listed in one group of terrorists who will fund for the new law of protecting the wildlife.
The punishment for them is found guilty of being involved in possession of illegal immigrants and being involved in wildlife products is 20 years in prison or a fine of 1 million shillings.
The defending champions of wildlife who plays for that law said the criminals are selling corners of the country and thus making them being the danger of terrorists.
"I put aside using illegal immigrants that involve international network and that is why the law will be changed to suspects who are not involved in the law to fight the illegal groups," said Mrs Make Me Sing, champions of the wildlife.
The terrorists has also been linked with illegal immigrants in order to get money to fund their actions.
Last year, the report of one international organization carried out a terrorist group of Al-Shabaab with an increase in witchcraft in East Africa.
Previously, 121 accused of illegal immigrants have been accused of being involved with wildlife products, doing business of those products without a permit and lack of information to the government officers that they had those products.
Under the new law with more effective, there are accused of being involved with illegal products of wildlife and having the members of the illegal group having an aim of benefiting from money by selling the wildlife products.
This year the fight against illegal immigrants led by 40 nations in the world caused the contract to protect the wildlife.
The defending champions of wildlife say that the contract that was not been reached in London City, England, is divided into Kenya which is believed to save people facing a danger of falling.
