The government has started talks with the China development Bank, so as to enable banks in the country to be used to lend entrepreneurs who want to invest in industries in the country.

That was said in parliament by the deputy minister of foreign affairs and East Africa cooperation, Doctor Susan Kolimba when he was looking at a question by the nominated member of parliament, Meshark Bandawe (CCM).
He was asked to know the government has a plan to unite small and big entrepreneurs of Tanzania and China through Diplomacy, so as to get into a partnership to strengthen small and medium industries.
He said the government of China has started a special fund of finance because of enabling small and middle traders of Africa to get capital.
The fund has been built for five billion American dollars (105 trillion shillings). He also said that Tanzania is one of the four countries in Africa that China have been able to invest in its industries for the next three years.
He said as a result of that decision, the Jiangsu province and Zigamba has been made to invest in the country.
He added that the Tanzanian Embassy in China has been seeing the business people of that country to come invest in the country and it has also prepared several times the tour of China's company to come in the country to speak with the Investment Center of TIC.
