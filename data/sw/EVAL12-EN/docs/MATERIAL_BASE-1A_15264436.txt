UVCCM is surprised by Sumaye campaigning for Lowassa.

The secretary general of the Union of Youth of the Revolutionary Party (UVCCM), Shaka Hamdu Shaka has said he is happy to be the retired prime minister, Frederick Sumaye to help the presidential candidate on the ticket of the Party of Democracy and Development (CHADEMA), Edward Lowassa.

He said the decision by Sumaye is the same as the presence of a big campaign for the parliamentary seat and councilors of Mtwara villages while campaigning for the candidate of that constituency through CCM, Hawa Bayumi.

The campaign meeting took place at the village of Mo Pickup, in this province.

He said it is a snare for those leaders, who have ever been the top leaders of the CCM government and to fail to bring success and positive results, now they will enable citizens to bring change and development.

"Sumaye when he made a campaign rally for Lowassa to be the president is same as the presence of a big political campaign, they don't know if they are not aware if their names are not involved in front of the community, they were given an opportunity to fail to promote development," said Shaka.

Said Sumaye, the prime minister of the government under the third phase of the president in Benon, the management had caused many district councils in the country to get dirty documents according to the report of the controller and auditor general of the government.

Furthermore, Shaka insisted that the name of Lowassa being involved with CCM sessions in the presidential race, while he said that he was not true.
