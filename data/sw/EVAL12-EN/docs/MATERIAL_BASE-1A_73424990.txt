The government's lawyer, Hungary, has claimed to the court that, when they will be used for two mistakes including causing a plot to open fake phones with a name that comes with a name of the Permanent Committee of Kagera Sugar which number 415,006,500 shillings.
He was mentioned the second time is to use power and their positions contrary to the law.
