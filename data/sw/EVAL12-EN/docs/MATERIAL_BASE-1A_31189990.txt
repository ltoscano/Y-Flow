The soccer lovers of Tabora province have been encouraged to elect leaders who will referee the regional soccer in that province which for now come back behind compared to last years.

Speaking at the finals to look for the specialist doctors at the Soundton Sound Band, Igunga District, the Member of Parliament of Ulyankulu, John Kadyage has urged them to use this year's elections to elect leaders who will return the honor of Tabora province in the world of soccer.
He explained that the leaders who were chosen have no intentions of doing the soccer game to shoot the soccer game and that the opportunity has been found this year to choose the leaders who will give them honor to the province, while talking to the nation's honor.
He noted the challenges of the competitions that are taking place in the villages to be with talents thus urged the village players to be patient instead of wanting to be fast.
Those finals were also attended by the former Yanga soccer player and Taifa Stars team, Edusei for Lungangira who was chosen to encourage the youth to go to the soccer game.
The Soundton Sound Band has been sponsored by the member of parliament of Manonga county, Seif Gulamali who has contributed money to cash and the second winner when the second winner of the national team got 70,071 shillings and the third winner in Nyasa to get a cup at 1,000,000 shillings.
