The swimming association in Tanzania (TSA) is expected to do a constitutional meeting on Friday in Zanzibar Islands, being one day before the start of a swimming competition in the nation.

The secretary general of TSA, Ramadhan Namkoveka said that the constitutional meeting will take place at the Zanzibar Sports Council meeting starting in the morning.
"For a long time we have been in the process of improving the constitution through a way of receiving opinions after TSA started a draft and taken to our members who are the club," he said.
He talked about the issue of making adjustments to that due to various reasons including the situation that emerged in the general elections of the party (TSA) which was held in Morogoro, October 10, 2015, where the swimming party (Tanzanian CA) did not vote because the constitution was not aware of it.
Also, he said if the players commission is a must for them to be on the performance committee, positions as the director of technical, the director of finance and otherwise he will be mentioned directly in the constitution.
"Due to those reasons, it is a must for our constitution to be used to go hand in hand with the same time and for the interests of the party and a swimming game in general," he said.
He said other people who participated in giving their views are the executive committee of TSA and their lawyer, who has done a great job to ensure the law of a swimming Federation (Fina) and the countries that are considered as required.
Namkoveka said that the efforts of the process will end that day by passing the draft if they will get consent from the delegates of the constitutional meeting that they attended and taken to the registrar of sports parties so as to get the consent of the government.
