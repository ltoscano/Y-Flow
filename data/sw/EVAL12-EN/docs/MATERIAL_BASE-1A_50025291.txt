Thanks for Yaya Toure.
Brightiles 21, 2013.

These days there is a distance of someone who has placed a distance from one match, these machines have brought in great revolution in a way that people are taught the players and the game.
If the Jehovah's people could have done so in the last weekend between Taifa Stars and Ivory Coast, it is clear that they have found Salum Abubakar, Mwinyi Kazimoto by Frank Domayo applauding a long distance than Yaya Toure.
It is also possible that statistics would have shown how women Mwinyi has made a lot of work more than Yaya Toure in my opinion, Jean Jacques Lambert, and the one mid-fielder of Ivory Coast, maybe he had a lot of love than Yaya Toure.
But there are two things that Yaya Toure made the work but all the other organs of that day do not decrease.
He gave a point of one goal (the first one, all the important one more than Ivory Coast) and he scored two goals, only one goal that he did not get married, he is the one who engaged to a pass (Gervinho.
When I remember more is the truth that, Yaya scored the first goal for a small punishment in the area that Stars got three positions and made it a chance.
That is why he gets 400 million shillings for a week (money) of Tanzania) and that is the budget of the whole year for many teams in the Tanzania Premier League.
He found a little bit when he entered with speed when he wanted to resolve the ball or when he wanted to break the ball or when the other time he used to prepare themselves in an easy area to receive the ball.
Another day of these days has no not been left for many days of these days it does not have been found dead in the pitch and it does not be paid for a long time.
Many years after the ball started to be played, something important than all that I have remained to be only one goals.
I thank you, Yaya Toure for the subject if we go to each other.
