Government lawyers are 10 million dollars.
The lawyers in the country have collected more than 10 million in the construction of a modern center of conflict resolution.
"The council of government lawyers in the country (LSK), has identified himself to support the members that by December 18, 2014, 439 members were given a sum of 460,432 people," said the Executive Director of the party Mister Apollo Mboya.
Mister Mboya said that the plans of starting the construction of that center is going on and that its launch will be conducted earlier this month.
That party had already been able to collect 200 million shillings from members, with the only important level and other financial institutions like loans for loans.
Despite that, there has been a sign of some members.
Mister Mboya said the project was still underway and the construction will start soon after the construction started.
That announcement is happening as the High Court is expected to give a decision on Friday if the project will continue after some of its members will arrive in court to oppose its construction.
Those members arrived at the court following the way that was being used to pay those money, saying they were being inclined.
And how about her birthday.
