It's a two weeks time now, there have been different issues that are being reported to the media and to be discussed in social media networks that was very happy about it is after several people were using a message, let me ask questions about some of those things.
For example, there is a person who asked me, why the police force was unable to take a contract to the parliamentary committee and it did not fulfill any time when I told him, why I told me, why Honorable Esther Bulaya was arrested and brought up with a plane from Mwanza.
Sometimes he asked me there is a person in Arusha he is accused with an offense of giving him Mhungula ward, but there is a person who is calling people without doubt and why do not be taken against them?
Another person asked the name of the late lawyer, TANESCO after the judgment of the former manager of TANESCO after the judgment of the former manager and his colleagues, he has complained that there is bribery in this issue, "said he has complained that there is bribery so that he can be taken because his work is to address bribery?
I got a lot of questions because these questions have been brought to and different people from different parts and do not tell me that I have answers if I believe that I think you can have more questions, because I believe that I have heard a lot of questions.
Clatchy Marimba will not agree with him, he says the philosophy of try to understand the environment that the whites have found themselves in this world without deciding or planning the way other people should stay, and how people are supposed to live.
There are many others that they did not want to answer my philosophy question but they also gave a good thing and not a good thing, that is not good and it does not have a good thing that your good time you can do and do not care for other good people.
These thoughts came out when I met with some people to think about the questions I have been asked there about these questions, but when you look at details, there is no wonder because our country has left, but if you consider some of our culture is the one with capital, property, status or office.
