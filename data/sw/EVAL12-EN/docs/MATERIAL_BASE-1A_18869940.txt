One day after the Democracy and Development Party in Mbeya Province are from the leaders of CCM, Mbeya Province who were chosen to be the winner.
The member of the national executive council of CCM, Mbeya Region, Mister Saad Kawemba, has canceled those statements and promised the strengthening of CHADEMA in that province.

Shangwe who identified himself as the chairperson of CHADEMA, CHADEMA said that he knows all ways of strengthening CHADEMA and that he didn't expect to defend his parliamentary position that was found under his leadership that they will continue to remain in the hands of CHADEMA.

He said that all the leaders of CHADEMA who have died in his hands and has been knowing their responsibilities, therefore, he will use that opportunity to complete CHADEMA in that province and he is expecting to build a new CCM with productivity and interests to the citizens of Mbeya province.

"I'm in CHADEMA with my hands and now I will give them with my hands, they do not have alternative means of leadership, all of them who are in Mkabakuli.

Among the weaknesses that Shangwe has explained that it is together with leaders who were unable to implement the promises they had promised during the election campaigns in the year 2010 and that a lot they are doing does not have interests to the citizens and the nation.
He said that as a result of having a scholar and a scholar, he was surprised to see the leaders that many of them have participated to give parliamentary forms and decided to start demonstrations and decide to start demonstrations in the whole country and from parliament while President Kikwete addressing a situation that he said is lack of discipline.

He said that CHADEMA is a party with the people that are unable to think quickly due to the fact that our minds are enough, to discover themselves and not easily swayed and decided about peace in their country.
