People whose farms will be affected by the expansion of the rice project of a swim, he bought a total of Sh. 52 billion shillings.
That expansion will also involve the construction of a big dam together with the mining of iron sheets to bring in water in that dam.
While announcing that step yesterday, the chairperson of the board of man is supposed to contribute towards the farms for the rice project of Mungumaji ward, Mister Hosea Way, said that the government has given out 60 million shillings to start to be paid in the next week.
That expansion will take over one acre of 2018 at a cost of 30 billion shillings from Mpera areas where they will be built at a cost of 163 billion shillings.
That step is expected to increase the amount of rice located in that project every year from 62 tons to 100,000 tons.
That project of travel is the biggest of the areas in East and Central Africa and it is expected to be available in one of 4200 farmers.
It is producing 80 percent of all rice which is used in the country.
However, many of the farmers have no documents for farms and they have been urging the government to give those important documents.
The chairman of that project, Mister Mutta, said that the farms who don't have cases of inheritance will be paid compensation without delay.
He said that there is an opportunity for the farms which will continue to be transferred to areas instead of compensation.
"There are 200 acres that the government has set aside for that activity and there are those who will continue to be transferred instead of being paid for compensation and we assure you that they will get money to start a new life in those farms," he said.
