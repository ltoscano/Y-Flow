While the business people who benefited from the port continued to surrender, yesterday, Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) has clarified that it has not started a new building for participating in products from outside the country.

Speaking yesterday with this newspaper, the Deputy Executive Director of the Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) Doctor Egid Mubofu, said that by being the last day of reviewing the money it was announced by the minister, they will work up until night so as to serve the business people who will come up yesterday to support them.
"I cannot inform us that how many uses you were not allowed, but tomorrow I will be in the position of giving a number because today I will do it up until night so as to serve those who come up," said Doctor Kone.
He said that he will also communicate with the minister of industry, trade, and investment, Charles Mwijage to know the steps that will be taken by business people who will fail to remove them within the allocated time.
Mwijage gave five days to business people who are accused of abduction and buying 100 using them to ensure they have presented their debts so as to be demolished and know what the effects are.
He gave thanks for those who will come out and taken legal action, but they will be forced to pay for 15 percent charges.
