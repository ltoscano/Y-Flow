There is no good management of drugs.
I am sure we are forced to get some of the Mara region we are told that the government hospitals are being given a lot of drugs every month and another thing is that on the beginning of the beginning, you can go a argument and you were told malaria drugs.
Now when you asked himself, it means that those drugs were given a small margin and it is good for this issue to be put up openly because we are using the low-income people who we have no money for 30th June.
Again, the surprising thing is that you will find Amana bank to answer that there is no drugs.
Patients so that those drugs do not end in their shops or other hospitals, especially private.
If the government intends to remove this situation then give great punishment for suffering from mistakes like this because they are not different from the murder.
I advise that the presence of investigators who will go to the hospital and normal patients do not lie on how we are affected and these nurses will think that the hospital is their property and he can answer you.
