The solar energy company has been banned from TBS after the selling of parasites.

The Tanzania Bureau of Standards has done an impromptu visit and handed over the Kili Challenge factory that is making the juice type which is in Kihonda in Morogoro Municipality by selling machines that are derived from the use of human rights and urged them to be removed from the market immediately.
While speaking during the closing of the factory, Doctor Raqqa, has said that TBS has joined the factory after realizing that the juice products produced in the factory that are controlling and clean, and that factory is growing up under a level as well as using sugar contrary to the procedure.
And the TBS relations officer Roida Andengeye has said that in line with the production of that factory, it has not been separated by houses to live, something that is contrary to the law of industries where he has urged the business people to stop the juice extracted from human use since they are unsuitable for human use.
On his part, the production manager of Devis Amen Group Limited (Tadu), has said he didn't agree with the procedure used to hold that factory because he is involved while complaining about him that his factory is growing by following procedures of standards like other industries that are making juice.
