After getting the regulations, do not tire you again M12, 2014.

Yesterday, Tuesday in Dodoma town, the special constitutional parliament passed the regulations of that parliament they will use the process of getting the draft of the new constitution.
It is not a secret that the regulations have finally been called after close to the whole month, to check up on events that you want to pass as a shame.
In those conflicts, we witnessed abusive language, saddens and everyone of its involved in addition to delegates, I think that they were collected is hooligans, and so many people remain in the community and the country as a whole.
Now, the regulations have been set aside for them as a reason that they have reduced that the ones to lead them in getting what is needed, we are expected to come from them which is to get a new constitution.
They want this is not another but it's a new constitution that enables many of the ones that they want for the development of their country.
Therefore, delegates that have ever heard that the nation depends on them as a shameful things that they witnessed, the citizens do not expect to leave him in heavy work that is in front of them.

They should remember that you are in Dodoma for the interests of the nation.
It is our faith that from now the parliament will be self-wise people who will be connected with strength of argument and not the strength of the issue and not a constitution that will be a constitution that will have a solution to many problems, such that we have recently.
