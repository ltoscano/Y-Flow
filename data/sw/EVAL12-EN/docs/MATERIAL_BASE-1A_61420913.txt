The efforts of solving the conflict between the doctors in the country that were dumps founded by the Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda today divided after the doctors went to attend a session a session that was requested by the Prime Minister at the Karimjee hall.

That step by doctors has set aside what was stated that the government has not been unable to solve their long-term conflict by the government not to listen to the employees of the health sector in the country.

At the Karimjee hall, some of the servants of the government institutions are the ones who attended where there is no longer a doctor who were present even after getting in the office of the Prime Minister.

Following the existence of those doctors who were expected to meet the prime minister so as to listen to their claims, Minister Pinda announced officially that if those doctors will go back to work tomorrow on Monday, they will have removed themselves from public service.

"Said these doctors want tomorrow along with work if they will be unable to arrive at work tomorrow, they will have removed themselves from the public servants," said Mister Pinda the prime minister used the opportunity to speak to the servants of various government institutions and claimed that the government will give an opportunity to meet the doctors to look for solutions for their claims that he has claimed to be a foundation.
