The breast cancer farmers have appointed new directors who will referee for their 54 industries in the country.
The report from the headquarters of the council of tea production in the country (collecting debts) said 29 directors lost their seats in the great election that started two days ago.
Also in collecting debts, 45 directors were selling their seats, though the new players were selected.
However, the farmers from Tembela, he from Nyamatala, Nyamgenda, and their Kiira from Meru did not participate in that election because the court stopped the elections in those areas.
