The results of form four are reported that Tanzania has been sacked.

The government today in parliament through the Prime Minister has canceled the form four results and said that the exams will be condemned.

A question among them is a question so that when she gave the news analysis, the results will take care of the results but the results are not aware of the results but the results are not aware of the results.

I see if the port does not be taken against them.


Opinions for the ministry of education and for those who had passed were going on with their studies because their studies for their studies have lost free and then it is supposed to listen to those who had failed.


I have been asked, I give you this opportunity and to inform you about some time to end to them.

Thank you?
