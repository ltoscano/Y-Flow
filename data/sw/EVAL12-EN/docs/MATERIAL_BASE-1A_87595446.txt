Education is teachers.
Brightiles 11, 2012

In the ongoing conflict between the government and the teachers, I would like to give a short message through this column, a message that you want to pray for the teachers and any nation that is preparing itself to serve all over the world, and you put aside everything that will be taught inside a tree, without books and without laboratory.

Unfortunately, the improvements on education is going on here in the country which has done a lot of money in improving the buildings and other learning infrastructure, but the teachers have been very difficult because in many schools, teachers and the community as a whole, lack of teachers and teaching.

The dangers of bringing together teachers is that there is no reason that wants to have a lot of teachers and the profession of teachers they have done so as to look for more than 70 percent of teachers who are taught them because all times they are taught in teaching and they do not have the ability to become teachers.

The step by the teachers' Association (CT) accusing the government to revise the interests of the teachers, it aims at improving their work and bad luck that the court's dreams and to announce the strike is more greater than open strike that was announced every person will know.

We urge them to wake up and agreed to discuss with the teachers' teachers, they have given their own claims by the government and it should not be careful, especially during a short time, the act of increasing salaries and allowances for members of parliament and doctors are an indication of not caring about them.

The government used the preparation opportunity for the teachers and the court to think about it about the claims by the teachers and to take appropriate measures against the teachers, we think education is important for our nation without caring for teachers, we will let us learn about our education, and we will also choose an entrepreneur as a nation.
