Whoever does not want to be made towards a school committee.

The minister of the country, office of the president, relations and coordination Stephen Wasira, has urged parents to form the committee and the school board so as to supervise the contributions and development of the school instead of leaving the school heads.
Responding to the problems of citizens in his constituency yesterday in various villages, Wasira, who is the member of parliament of Bunda Constituency said many contributions are due to the heads of the school to make their decisions themselves.

He urged the education officers in the council to supervise the sponsors of the parents committee for every primary schools and secondary schools so that they can assess the development and various problems between the parents, students and teachers.

"The problem is that parents have heard the heads of schools to do everything about the school, for example, contributions for desks every year, these desks are going on where the committee and the board of parents should know," said Wasira.

Previously, parents and guardians told BBC that they were surprised and contributions to school every time when the government gave a directive that many contributions should not give parents.

The issue of contributions for desks every year, buckets, spirits, and other equipment which were directed to parents while questioning the parents even such that is not seen in the school.
