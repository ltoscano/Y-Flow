"Reference to you from this region is dangerous to a human life because it could not think especially in the world, the world has revealed that the area has already revealed more than 80 percent," he said.
He said that since the announcement of "Montreal Impact" September 16, year 1978 about the control of chemicals that are trying to try that show, the office of the vice president has continued to implement the implementation of the contract, being together with urging stakeholders to reduce the use of chemicals that are committed to the area according to the schedule made by the contract.
