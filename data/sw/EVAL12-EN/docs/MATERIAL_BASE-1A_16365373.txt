The Minister of Works Transport and Communication Professor Makame Mbarawa has said the government has paid 1 trillion shillings to the contractors with their own debts.

He has ordered the contractors to go back quickly in areas of construction of road projects and bridges and started those work fast, they should implement their contract and make another contract again in the country.
He has said that the fifth term government, will ensure all roads being built in tarmac roads, thus all the contractors have been given a contract to do their job at the speed of "Here, We Only Work," and not otherwise.
Professor Mbarawa made the statement the day before yesterday when he made a surprise visit to the construction project of Magoza village that is owned by a large bridge, Divock Origi which its construction was presented since September 2014 until it started again in June this year.
While in that inspection, he wanted the contractor from Civil Aviation Authority (for ECC) from China to increase the pace of construction of Magoza village which is a length of 486 kilometers due to the weaknesses that she showed in its construction or else that the government will help in his contract.
Previously, the acting manager of the Tanzania Roads Agency (Tanroads), Godwin Andulile (74) giving a report to the minister, he said that the Magoza village project is part of implementing the construction of Magoza village which is part of the implementation of 886 kilometers per class.
