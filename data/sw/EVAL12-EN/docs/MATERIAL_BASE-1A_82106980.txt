The TFF disciplinary committee is now on Tuesday.
Dar es Salaam, the executive committee of the Discipline of the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF), that was planned to be held today has been postponed until Tuesday May 3, this year.
The TFF information officer, Alfred Lucas, said the reason to postpone that session is as a result of some members to get free therefore, they could not attend the session when they intend to listen to the cases facing players and various coaches of the premier league and the first level league.
Some of the suspects in those cases are the attackers of Yanga, Donald Ngoma and Amiss Tambwe, John Bocco, Shomari,, Aishi Manula and Kipre Tchetche, and coach Stewart Hall all of Azam.
Others are Paul Junction, Zekhia Meghi, and Idrisa Mohamed of JKT Ruvu, Rajab Katunda (JKT Camp), Ismail Noma, Said Juma, Idd Selina and Edward Amos all from Dodoma police.
Tambwe and Ngoma have been taken to that committee as a result of complaints from Simba that they have assessed the acts of involving their players, Hassan Kessy and Mshereheshaji Shebe Machumani.
