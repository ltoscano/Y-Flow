Nape Amy Lowassa being the late Asukile has said that she is the ones that they had seen and there is nothing the work he made without stealing and Kazura who is also the late Edward Lowassa.

The member of the victory committee of the Revolutionary Party, Nape Nnauye has used approximately 10 minutes against the presidential candidate on the CCM ticket, Edward Lowassa who was a member of that party.

Nape went against Lowassa yesterday when he was given a chance to announce the presidential candidate of CCM, Doctor John Magufuli at the Samora grounds, Iringa town.

He said Lowassa is a penalty by the most corrupt people to have that there is no place that he was given to work at CCM levels and the government without stealing.

Nape claimed that Lowassa was unable to sit on the Revolutionary Party because he cannot be in the Revolutionary Party because he cannot be followed, "Lowassa is getting married," said Nape.

In another step, Nape claimed that Lowassa wanted the leaders of the top level of UKAWA and CHADEMA to get a chance to vie for the parliamentary seat which previously it was the other day.

In his explanation, Nape said that the member of parliament of Iringa town, Pastor Peter Msigwa is among those who were bought by Lowassa for 340 million shillings.

Nape has been suffering from Lowassa since he announced his decision of moving from that party and joined CHADEMA.

Nape has been quoted saying that he has been trying.

He has and Lowassa for 12 years inside CCM and that his music is doing?

However, since he started his campaigns, Lowassa has been silent without writing the attacks of Nape and other CCM leaders, a situation that makes him continue to get a great popularity of the child.

While Nape was using a long time to fly himself, Lowassa was in Tanga city when he was doing a big campaign meeting that was forced to give me a result of floods which continues to go to the area of the meeting.
