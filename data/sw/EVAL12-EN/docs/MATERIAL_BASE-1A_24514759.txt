How has the government to give your promise?
28th of 5, 2015.

In November last year, the government announced that they decided to pay his debt of more than 1 trillion shillings, that is claimed to have different bags of social security here in the country by December 14th last year.
Basically, the government does not promise to pay the whole debt when it pledged to pay a half of that debt by using a certificate, a decision that everyone wants to know how the bags are seen, he mentioned the current decision.
No wonder, it is that during the parliament meeting that is going on in Dodoma town, we are told that the government has not implemented his promise. It is not that it has not completed his promise but it has also been unable to give information that it has not been unable to give information that it has not been unable to give those reports.
We think that this step is not rowdy to bags which is claimed by the current retirees and ability, who at a large extent that will happen from there.
The government is an institution that is required even if it is saying something, it is a must that you benefit from 100 percent. This procedure is to say different from doing different problems is not a procedure that you need to understand inside the government.
For many people, it's true that the government does not like to talk a painful truth, most of the government has started raising questions to some of us that if it can run it in the parliamentary committee or parliament as a whole, will be talking to the truth.
This question may be asked by other contestants as well as various contractors, the financial institutions that were affected by our country, we are not happy to say what is supposed to help any government keenly anywhere in the world.
Our citizens as a government is only one, it does not like to talk about the truth, even if it gets, it's better than giving a promise that does not have an opportunity to implement that process.
