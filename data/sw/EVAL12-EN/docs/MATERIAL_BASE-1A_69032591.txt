Brightiles 30th, 2014.

It is not true that this newspaper has been one of the media here in the country who have reported more about the scandal of Escrow account which is currently expected to end through the Parliament of Tanzania.

In addition to threats, without giving up with the danger of open security due to the issue being taken, our citizens, we did not ask ourselves to make sure that in the end, the truth is open.

However, in the recent days, it started having events that in a way seems to go against what this newspaper and other stakeholders have been fighting for a period of six months ago.

It has emerged as a habit of mentioning names of people who are not involved in any way to the issue, these names have been mentioned to take bribes from the Independent Power Tanzania company (IPTL) in order to achieve the amount of money.

They have also started being mentioned in the names of some of the government officials and politicians, who investigation in the office of the controller and auditor general of the government (CAG) was not heard, but now they are explained to be involved.

In short, that we see for now, it's because some people want to use the opportunity of this issue of Escrow account, has spoilt people who are not involved in different reasons including political parties.

This Escrow issue is high and needs to be dealt with because if every foundation is needed to be sold and everything you are required to be sold and wherever you are not allowed to have the right to be taught.

It will be something like people they will want to use this issue to end their anger to their political rivals, it will be something like people with integrity will move to their professional and family life because of political issues.
