CCM should make a decision.
May 20, 2015.

This week, the Revolutionary Party (CCM) is expected to do its important meetings in the national level for the purpose of discussing and planning its performance towards the general elections of this year.
Because CCM is the ruling party for now, it is clear that the eyes and ears of the IMF are directed to Dodoma and he was held those sessions with the aim of knowing what will be decided.
Without doubt, in recent years, there is no session of the executive committee of CCM (CC) and the National Executive Council (NEC) and the National Executive Council (NEC) which could not wait because it has been planned to take place between May 22 to 24 this year.
In addition to that the nation is in the system of many parties, many research that took place in the recent days show that CCM is the one that will give President Jakaya Kikwete's president to be appointed Jakaya Kikwete.
If there will be no reason to change the political situation in the country, CCM is the one that is expected to give President Magufuli due to that, citizens are expecting that the party will do everything possible so that eventually getting a candidate who will meet their nation's love.
President Tenga of Tanzania is faced with a lot of challenges, there is a matter of lack of employment, poverty, corruption, corruption and hard state of life. President Kikwete is expected to be a person with the ability to solve this problems.
That is why, we see that CCM is supposed to show how it's determined to meet the thirst for analysts or those sessions.
There are not many challenges and big challenges and our political parties including CCM, the ones who are supposed to do things that have discovered that they see this which affects we do.
While we are conducting well CCM in their sessions, we are urging them to be keen and make a good decision to our nation.
