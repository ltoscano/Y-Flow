The ones that are going on between the politicians in the Rift Valley region in relation to his retirement from the inspector general of police David Kimaichako said that it is a shame and that can be resolved.
M should continue to be cheated.
On one side, the leaders of that area led by the Governor of Eldoville dairies Maranga, Alex Tufani ', North East and his fellow members of Kenja, East and his colleagues of Kenwanja, that he could be evicted, Mister Kimaiao from his office.
We believe that Mister Kimaiyo is a whole person, with a sober mind and talked about anything that he didn't understand that, therefore, he does not hesitate to move to power after he sees that, his position had started to loose hope.
We are not happy, Mister Onesimus Laizer, but the truth is that, the stand of the trainer in relation to the performance of the Minister for Internal Affairs, Mister Joseph Lowoko, and Mister Kimaiyo has been supported by many.
The trainer is one of the those who have no doubt, they put the security of the country instead of defending their colleague in the basis of the lineage, it was obvious that Mister Ole Lerner has said that Mister Kimaichako said that Mister Kimaichako said that Mister Kimaichako said that Mister Kimaichako said that Mister Kimaichako said that Mister Kimaichako said that Mister Kimaichako said that Mister Kimaiyo they would have received network of that work.
So, if every community will help her "a person," everyone is unable to do with work, this country will continue to be true and since when the other positions have been set aside, we are communicating with a group of youth and scholars from Eliona.
Security when you know, all of us are affected, all those who need to go back to work to Mister Kimaiyo and Mister Avit Nyambele.
