President of Tanzania, Doctor John Magufuli in making a great language of Swahili has decided to address the 17th session of the heads of member states of the East African Community (EAC) which took place today in Dar es Salaam by using Swahili.

President Magufuli before starting his speech at the meeting which was attended by the president of Uganda, Yoweri Musomba and the president of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, gave a speech in Swahili language despite the existence of the English language.
"I have a speech of two types here in the world, another Swahili language, but I will be addressing Swahili language," said President Magufuli whispering to his speech.
As a result of addressing that meeting in Swahili, there was a terrorist who was present at that hall for the purpose of those involved in that language recently, the East African Parliament passed through her communication language.
