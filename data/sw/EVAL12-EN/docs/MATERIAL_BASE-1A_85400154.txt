With Benedict Liwenga.

The Provincial Commissioner of Dar es Salaam, Mister Meck Sadiki, has appealed to the province councils to implement development projects which until the end of July and September this year, the level of its implementation was very high.
Mister Sadiki gave that directive in Dar es Salaam city the day before yesterday at the Advisory Committee of the province (RCC), which some of its participants are members of parliament of that province and directors.

He said the Municipal of Temeke, Ilala and Kinondoni have been unable to supervise the implementation of development projects this year without primary reasons so as to stop the development of citizens.

"

"All development projects are implemented by considering the manifesto of the Revolutionary Party (CCM), all the three provinces to ensure business people who use their products in areas which are not allowed to benefit from road vehicles which are not official," he said.

Previously Mister Sadiki gave that order but the directors of the municipality have been unable to resolve it at the reasonable level.
