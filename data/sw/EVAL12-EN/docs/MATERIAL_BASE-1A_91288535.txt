The government in Dodoma province will make an operation to remove local children from the estates, who have been a nuisance to customers who eat a hotel in the area, whom they sell the food and even its customers.

Speaking with this newspaper today, the head of Dodoma District, Christine Ishengoma, said he will remove those children because of being dangerous to the lives of other people. Mndeme said those children have been sitting on groups and misuse of drug abuse and they have been entering a hotel and robbed off their customers and even drinks.
"The department of community development will start using the street children who are smoking of marijuana," he said.
He said that those children have been sitting on groups and be a threat to the way especially during the evening due to their involvement in crime.
He also said that there have been a habit of some children to enter into a hotel and signed a lot of food and drinks and then run away, an issue that brought together good pictures and those acts are stable.
"We will know the family that they come from those children, will not be returned from and others will be taken to school," said Mndeme.
He said that they take over that step keenly so that children who will be removed from again in the streets since it shows his past years, but after time, those children went back again in the streets.
