CUF to fight the scandal of electricity in the country.

By Darassa.

Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CUF) has given a call to the Minister of Energy and Minerals, Professor Sospeter Muhongo, to explain the truth about the state of electricity in the country.
The information that was given to the press in Dar es Salaam yesterday by the Deputy Director of Information, Publicity, and Human Rights, Mister Abdul Razaq Badru, said it has come at the time of knowing the truth, instead of continuing to know the problem of power shortages is due to the floods.

He said the statements offered by Professor Muhongo about the state of electricity in the country is to defend the division that is going on in Dar es Salaam.
He added that the electricity sector in the country is in a bad state because of the verification of time especially in that town.

He added that, that situation contributes to low-scale farmers, a situation that is increasing the high cost of production thus causing the products to rise.

"If this situation is due to the poor infrastructure why TANESCO had touched me because until now, it is more than six months this problem continues," said Mister Rajesh Mistry.

He said that is happening in the government, it is a player of Toto Africans for the citizens that is not supposed to continue but TANESCO is supposed to solve the problem and he did not see a shame to eliminate the government's statement that there will be no need of electricity.

The day before yesterday, Professor Muhongo was in Musoma town, Mara Province, he met with youths of the Revolutionary Party (CCM), and claimed that the verification of electricity has come from time arising from infrastructure.
