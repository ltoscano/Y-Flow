It has been written by me.

I was revealed at 5 October, 2016.

Uganda's parliament has praised the government of Tanzania by having a council of ethics in other countries in Africa that is involving the public servants including fighting corruption.

Speaking at a meeting between the Parliamentary Committee on Constitution and law of Uganda and the Public Leaders Ethics Secretariat yesterday in Dar es Salaam, the leader of the committee, Jacob Ochoa and Otolo, said that in African countries, Tanzania only is the stable council and that maybe Nigeria is ongoing.
Oilcom, who is a member of parliament for Meleba North constituency in Torino town, Uganda said that the reason to come to the country is to learn how small secretariat works due to being given teeth and laws that are in the constitution.
"Uganda we have a plan to make corrections on the proposed law in 2002, with the aim of having public servants and that without learning can't know the experience that are there and how to avoid those challenges," he said.
The commissioner of Public Service Management in the country, Judge Salome Mwaipopo, said that those members of Uganda in order to deal with experience and the Ethics Secretariat of Tanzania so as to see the works.
"We have told them that our council is the source of the constitution of the year 1977 and it is claimed that it has been revealed in the constitution for example, a member of parliament was not allowed to vie for a period of five years to be fined or given a warning," said Judge Warioba.
He explained that they had decided to learn the parliamentarians of Uganda because of their law of ethics being in the only law while what is needed, the law that will be supported go hand in hand with the constitution itself to give the teeth.
