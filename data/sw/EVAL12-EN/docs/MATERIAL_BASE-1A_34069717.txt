Responding to the fire accidents.
Wealth of the great value of the money has been recently taken in Nairobi city under mysterious circumstances, even though the fire arrived at the tragedy area as soon as possible, they found that they did not have enough water to put off the fire because another vehicle for switching off the fire was there after 12 hours.
This is not the first time to witness the fire in the Guvnor's market, because there have been problems like that two months ago and until now, the expectations of many is that he from Nairobi city is supposed to ensure that the efforts of switching off the fire is clear.
We are saying that at the moment there are politicians in the city towards fire areas and to comfort the victims so that maybe he can increase their political popularity, "we have them a lot of brotherhood to listen and be cursed.
It is a must to inform our leaders that to give them victims of money and to remove faith that we will benefit them because we need to last long distance.
Recently after Beki of Mike Pence, made a phone to the fire offices and it was taken, we saw some officers of that department being sacked, but there is no better than 100 million shillings which have been built to buy fire vehicles.
That department has a challenge of enough equipment including fake vehicles is claimed to have two vehicles that are in good state and very few workers to deal with anything which can be used to rise up and anything which can cause violence.
