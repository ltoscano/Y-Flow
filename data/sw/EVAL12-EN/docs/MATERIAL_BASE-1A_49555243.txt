The Bajaj that is worth more than five million shillings has been issued by the office of the prime minister after the disabled person asked for the donation so that they help him in its activities of getting and looking for income to get the information.
It was a great joy to a physically challenged person who does not give donations of motorbike riders from the secretary general of Morogoro Province, he has not identified himself just after giving him a gift of the disabled and to be able to fight against corruption and for the intended purposes.
