The partnership in the government is important.
The partnership between the department of court and other government departments need to be approved as well as an emergency.
Events that have been going to reach at the moment is not satisfactory, and cut off the danger of not being implemented by the constitution fully.
A good example of a bad relationship that is among those units have been witnessed very much when the instructions were issued by the court to the national members of parliament or the Senate.
We have seen several times how members of parliament especially in the Senate are going against the instructions of the court and caused a huge tension between them and the court.
The political leaders, including President Uhuru Kenyatta, have complained openly that some of the instructions offered by the national service delivery.
On the other side, the judges led by the Chief Justice Willy Mutta explained on that it is a must that the court can be considered if we have an intention of protecting the constitution and to maintain the importation of laws in the country.
But in all that, the law is the one that has remained as the main reason for leaders, and the court is the main responsibility to investigate the law.
In the constitution, all public leaders are needed to implement their responsibilities for the benefit of the citizens.
The areas that provide information about what is needed to be the member of parliament, the president, the chief justice, the director of public funds and even the head of law explained openly that they will move to the interests of the citizens priority.
Therefore, it is the responsibility of every leader to make sure that the action is taken, they can benefit from very political people, but to remove political rivals, instead, it is important for the judges to be followed by law and that time has contributed to the interests of the public.
