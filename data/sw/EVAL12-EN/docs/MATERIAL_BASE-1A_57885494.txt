I thank you so much and I ask you to stop the issues of economy.
The late God bless you in Dar es Salaam to see for him to talk for him because there are things that has bought it at a cost of six months ago according to one month.
The Almighty God bless you.
Electricity is complete.
There are many things like milk and even so, I cannot remember the late God and ask you to know this economy has its kind that is continuing to be good or it continues to be good.
Welcome him when you reached the late God, because the ordinary citizen can't have a thing like milk, a song that he did in the past, is not good and it's not a good friend.
