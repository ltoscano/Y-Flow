Haazu taking flowers.
Dodoma I think the statement of the Mbozi member of parliament, Paschal Haazu taking research.
Questions, he says that if the agricultural ministers have been unable to go back because they did not do justice to farmers.
The Member of Parliament Haazu made those remarks yesterday in parliament and that we shall take up to the names of those ministers.
He said the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries was called Stephen Wasira, followed by Christopher Chihira, the Geofrey Zambi and Adam Malima who have not back to parliament.
After the statement, I heard very much quickly, when Haazu made these remarks in front of the popular artist "Tyrese Gibson," the situation would like to go back to parliament but it's not good for him to return to parliament and therefore they will not be responsible, they will not be responsible.
For free advice by Haazu taking a mixture of the cemetery that started losing the smell to remember, there is a song that was mentioned by a one that says, we learn not to learn from who failed and again the chest.
