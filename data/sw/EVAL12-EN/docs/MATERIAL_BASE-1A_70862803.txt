The retired prime minister and member of parliament for Monduli, Edward Lowassa was officially introduced to CHADEMA on 28 July 2015 in Dar es Salaam in the company of his wife, Regina Lowassa together with their children.

In a list of leaders of UKAWA which were there to receive and handed him a CHADEMA card, he was also James Mbatia, Professor Lipumba, Doctor Emmanuel Makaidi, Salum Mwalimu and Freeman Mbowe.

Salum Mwalimu is the Deputy Secretary General of CHADEMA Zanzibar, yesterday said this about the reception.

"We are happy to be very disturbing, I don't see if there is a leader of CHADEMA that phone has ever been seen since yesterday, phones that were touched by yesterday, every person has spoken to a foolish thing.

"Tomorrow (today) Honorable Edward Ngoyai Lowassa will take a form to vie for the presidency of Tanzania through CHADEMA, but maybe there will be a lot of celebrations on each other with his candidate, when he decided to come up with a mistake, but we believe there will be a lot of celebrations."

Salum Mwalimu also spoke about the reasons for the other leaders of UKAWA which is Tundu Lissu and DSlaa, where he said.

"We have many things that we have a lot of strategies, we should be divided into politics and not every event to be together.

"Yesterday who did, Tundu Lissu is where he is and today's today, even if he joins you shortly in the election period, we have many issues that we cannot be divided due to the schedule we have."
