It was only.
If you are.
He used to be.
It has not been did not to register myself if people are supposed to go.
Look at the national level to be the coach.
Why does it mean?
He was walking me.
I'm in his belts on stage that night.
On Monday I cannot go down?
It is very happy that he was satisfied with the success and doing a conflict like what he did.
So we continue.
And I am very close to the stakeholder you think close to one way or another in developing the games he did for.
A lot of patriotism one.
For example, he said that he had a lot of people, he can help parents to cooperate with the owners of the sports centers, but one of them see the good example that is found, will solve a good example which will be able to start a sports center, then they will conduct their cooperation since the owners of sports stations.
But another thing.
Its a lot of patriotism in developing sports, we see a thing even when Said Meck Sadik at his right time, but he has also used many coaches to the youth, but he has encouraged the national team and it has ever done well for a reason for patriotism.
Therefore, those coaches are continuing to be patriotic and continue to get better coaches as if he used to play, Maranga, giving me a lot to the late.
