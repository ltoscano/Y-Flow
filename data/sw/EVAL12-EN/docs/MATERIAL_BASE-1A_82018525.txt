CHADEMA's fault is I saw, Slaa should be cursed?

Today I request to give my opinion about the mistakes that are done by top leaders.

I say openly that starting in the year 2007 up to 2009, any youth who came out and said that he is a member of CCM, he was very close to him, because, 90 percent of all youths especially universities were lovers of CHADEMA.

Today's parliament does not have many youths of fighting as it was in the beginning, it shows that CHADEMA has made great mistakes to ensure these youths will be used in spreading education every corner of the country towards the liberation of CCM administration.

CHADEMA's concept of being accused of being accused of being used for the youth is a big offence and it will enable you to change your popularity, let them recognize the youths that complete the universities to work in spreading the party and not to trust them so that they can be able to bring change and not to sit each other.
