When a cry for difficult life, do you know what we are doing?

There is a cry for difficult life every corner, you will hear of the women, workers, youth, even the elderly who claim this period of fifth term money has been very difficult!

I ask you.
1, the government has explained to him of corruption, not to prevent drug abuse, its results, citizens know life of life has been difficult because of its meaning?

2: The collection of tax to serve the citizens have increased so much but the cry for every corner, the problem?

3, are the best life in the past period that were results of theft, corruption, misuse of public funds and paying taxes?

4, I have heard that those of the customers and many institutions that are present as a result of the use of the government. I asked himself, these people started those institutions / houses / Hotel which are only 4 hours depending on the customers to be only the government.

5, how do I think what is worried about what goes against them without corruption, the use of life has reduced, the government should have enough money, and the lives of citizens do not forget yourself to the rich and poor eyesight?

I was trying to look for him.
