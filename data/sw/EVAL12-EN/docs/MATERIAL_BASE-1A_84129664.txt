SUMATRA has got a station of Mwenge-1.

The Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA) has announced to relocate the popular bus station of Mwenge to go to the Makumbusho area.

In his report to the press yesterday, the officer in charge of SUMATRA in the East African region, Conchesta Ngaiza, said the center will be officially opened this Sunday with the area, an issue that causes vehicles to fail to enter that station on time, especially during morning hours and in the evening.

He emphasized all drivers to obey the directive from Monday and that he will make that directive after the end of that process, he also urged the passengers not to be aired in that area when there is no station.

Recently, drivers of buses that do the journey between Mwenge, Tegeta and Ubungo were able to provide services to ensure the government explained an alternative station after being defeated in Ubungo station due to the construction of the road.
