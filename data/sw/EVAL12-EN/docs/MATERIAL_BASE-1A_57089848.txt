This few hours the Kenyans are among the leaders of various African countries.
They are expected to attend the commemoration of fifty years of freedom of Uganda.
Uganda which was led by the British got its freedom in the year 1980, where he was the prime minister in Washington DC.
He was given a full report and the representative of queen of England.
Those celebrations we will recognize the color of the Ugandan flag which is red in the afternoon by black they will be reduced by the president of that country, Yoweri Museveni.
Who is leading is what I don't know that for twenty-six years until now.
