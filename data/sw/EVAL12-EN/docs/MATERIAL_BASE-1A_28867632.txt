The head coach of Toto Africans of Mwanza, Rogassian Mahunnah yesterday announced officially to resign from that position.

Speaking with this newspaper, Kaijage said that he has done that decision as a result of fans and members of the club to send himself on his responsibilities.

That coach who also won the national soccer team of Twiga Stars, said he has been telling the leaders of Toto Africans on the habit of running its responsibilities, but there is no person who listen to him.
Kaijage has been the third coach to retire from Toto since last year was held by Dominic Glawogger and Martin Gwadar and Rogasian Kaijage.
Before Kaijage, that team was affected by Yanga player, John Tegete who decided to live with him without saying anything at the beginning of this season.
Kajiage led Toto in seven games where he won only one match against Mwadui FC, while being beaten four matches against Ndanda FC, Stand United, Prisons, and Mbeya City.
Toto is out with a draw of two matches against African Lyon and Ruvu Shooting.
On his side, the chairperson of Toto Godwin Aguilera has said that he has been getting information about the resignation of their coach but he has not started officially.
Kaijage has been the second coach to bid farewell to the teams of the premier league this season and was attended by the former Mwadui FC coach, Jamhuri Kihwelu 'Julio "who has decided to marry each other in the beginning of this week on claims that he is proud of the action of the referees to oppose them.
