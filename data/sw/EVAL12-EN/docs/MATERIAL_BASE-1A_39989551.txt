Surprisingly, the leadership is not money.
May 29, 2012

For sure it's true that this nation can continue to wane's things not only to get married but not to be heard.
And heading to this, it is a disease that is loaded in every corner of our life and bad luck, now it is up to politics, where we see every kind of wedding.
Yes, these people have returned to start with Mbeya City before being announced to be announced in the by-election campaign in Mbeya town, we have witnessed all types of pain in the meaning of words being mentioned by our politicians.
We are still witnessing the conflict during this campaign meeting instead of making us that the that they will do and making a public that you want to them, many of the candidates are complaining.
You can say that these noises have been so that this province of Mbeya villages is competition of parties and every party is supposed to fulfill the voters, that is why other factors that was announced is a joke.
But when you came from that party, there is a group of people who are supposed to have faith in one and its direction.
This week is the election week in one of the community of the Revolutionary Party (CCM). The Union of Women (UWT) is doing elections, to get, together with others, chairman.
We have ever heard that all camp that are vying for the position of chairperson, we are looking for several times, from the normal procedure of voting in elections, get abusive language and a big scandal.
There are news about great use of money in this election to an extent that someone he asked himself, as he got to ask the father of the nation, Julius Nyerere, a person that he will give them?
We are still the believers of the election; a person with the ability of leadership, not with the ability of distributing a lot of money more than his opponent, but from all, it is safe for us because we request CCM members to make efforts to choose the leadership instead of money.
