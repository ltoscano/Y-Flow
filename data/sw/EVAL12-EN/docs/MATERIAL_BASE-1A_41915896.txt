The auction of rice bran.
And a picture.
The board of Father of water in the country (I B), has organized a rice auction in order to deal with the losses resulting from the conservation of that product in their profession.
The manager of the board in the western part of Kenya, Mister Manufacturing Company has exposed that, up to now, that auction has brought 17 million shillings to prepare for other seven days for it to be completed.
Mister Luda, he said that all the farms for growing the rice under the board of Father of water, farm in the western part of Kenya, had decided to continue producing their fees for them so as to address the problem of buying of rice in their warehouses, an issue that has caused the increase in production costs.
Although there are few buyers that came out to know me despite there was a newspaper analysis of that auction, Mister Literature in a lot of hope that the aim of reducing the rice that is in warehouses is not been reached.
