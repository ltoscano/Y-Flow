The government has asked the contractor who is in charge of the construction project of high road (with black spectacles) in Dar es Salaam city, to complete that work before October 2018, a period that project is required to be completed.

The Minister of Works Transport and Communication Professor Makame Mbarawa gave those instructions yesterday when he visited the construction center of the high road "flyover) in order to see the development of that project.
Mbarawa said that he wants the contractor to finish early the construction of that project because it is the first road road, therefore it will put a big problem to the road users in the country.
"This will be the first road, therefore it will put a great history in our country, that is the beginning of the history of Tanzania to have a high road," he said.
Mbarawa said that before the start of that high road, they did not depend on if the biggest part of the road could be given when the construction continues as it is now, a situation that causes the road use from one side to another.
Minister Mbarawa has thanked the government of Japan for sponsoring that project, which will cost 9394 billion until it will be completed.
The chief executive officer of TANROADS, Patrick Mfugale said that until now the project has no problems in the high road project was launched on April 16 this year by President John Magufuli.
