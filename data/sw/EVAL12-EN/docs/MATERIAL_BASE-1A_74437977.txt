There is great hope to get a lot of tourists and investors due to the campaign meeting at Sullivan Provost, our brothers from America and elsewhere, where we have learned from their South Africa, after seeing you put up poverty of Africa, after seeing that Manyema were touched and gave birth!
A bad road to go to that school, those who live under the school, have no enough books, together with their needs, to show joy and hope, but they did not have been beneficial to the most popular people as Kikwete, at Old and Nyerere.
