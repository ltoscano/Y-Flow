It's not each other who does not be afraid, the one who died is wrong, while others are still underway.

I write this when I was with great disappointment about the fact that you can represent especially during our country just after the former minister of houses and small houses, Tibakweza village, where he was quoted saying 22 million is for vegetables!

For sure this is not a lot of time, but my point is about the words that are going on in different networks that involve all the Wahaya brothers and this is not so much, because one person cannot be a criterion to killing many people in the concerned community!

Without doubt, you are witnesses about many statements that have ever been made by people of different types, especially the leaders, but it did not be involved with tribalism!
