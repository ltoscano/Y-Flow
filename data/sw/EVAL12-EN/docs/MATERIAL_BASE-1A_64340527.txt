Rutaisingwa, I don't have a plan to participate in the political campaigns and to make it a lot.

The artist who got very much before the year 2010 was known as Markhiya, has blamed her decision of getting the campaign of the CCM party since he has forced him to work hard.

"You know I am in the year 2010, I have gotten a lot of politics but I don't know what I don't have a lot of songs but you don't know that I have given a lot of songs but you don't know that I am not aware that I have written about CCM no worries at all people."

When a citizen wanted to know which party has planned to use the campaign for payments, he said it's still a time to put it publicly.

Most artists have reached a period of times not to do not found themselves in eternal peace, this is a system of many parties.
