Soon before Christmas, social network followed the news of my brother from Saudi Arabia, the one that has lost its own kind of heart vehicles enjoying the love.
Listen to you, more than a luxurious type of Mercedes Benz, which have been buried and the name of a swim.
It is an issue that has raised feelings of people who are among them her brother especially due to the expensive price of those vehicles.
For that daughters, it was a type of unique and a man between the forest of mind.
But in some of the men, that brother was a cry for putting his faith to a girl who even he had not found himself.
Without doubt, those thoughts are reports of our brother who instead of knowing this example, you are ready to give a long time because of insulting the brother who is unable to invest in the girl they prefer.
The problem of our brother here is that they desire to walk and seem to have a beautiful lady and that she can be proud to be on the way though they don't want their money to see the light.
He knows the girl to have a good heart that is pleasant and she does not have a need to know the price of hair color or the cost of preventing and downloading from the experts.
Many of them have been forced not to stop their daughters, who are marrying their clothes though they are not ready to destroy his girlfriend to buy the clothes or even to his membership at the exercise hall.
Some of them have peace in albinism that had been revealed to fail, though they don't have a need to know the price of oil and crude oil.
I get very happy that you're very happy and to sit close to the wedding, standing up to the ones it did not want to get money to buy a modern phone.
These are training for our customers here, that can't read the cost of a girl without getting points, and if some of our brother will be just a half, but if they are not supposed to speak about the bad behavior of her daughters in Kenya. "
Many claim that the weight issue of the fund should be noted but the truth is that even if he should have money instead of investing in every corner, I remember that my question is for your brother especially here in the country who are ready to do so?
Instead, most of them claim on how many Kenyans are smoking the mines without considering that if they could give the gold without any objection then there is no girl who is ready to send him in the mining activities.
