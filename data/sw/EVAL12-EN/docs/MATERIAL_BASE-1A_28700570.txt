Industries is possible if we will do.
I see some of our leaders you got up earlier that Tanzania cannot be a country of development of industries.
I am saying it is possible for you to stop the Mwalimu Nyerere when I get up to this country, due to many industries which were increasing the economy of our nation at a large extent especially before the war with Idd who came to war.
Again, the American Dollars was equal to 5 shillings in Tanzania, because it is that our money had a great value because we had a lot of products outside the country.
Our industries officially started with us themselves and we find itself from looting and causing losses to some of the industries.
For example, Kimara B industries, Mighty One, good and otherwise, there are people who were leaders during the Nyerere period they are supposed to be looked for them about the leadership of those industries.
But the industries is a democratic plan, therefore our leaders have a responsibility to ensure it is possible even in the country like China, Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil to learn how they can be able to succeed?
