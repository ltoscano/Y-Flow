DC gives a class to entrepreneurs.
Moshi District Commissioner, Novatus Makunga has urged entrepreneurs in Kilimanjaro Province to make products worth quality and quality so as to stop importation of products outside the country.
Makunga made that statement yesterday when he was opening a training for small-scale entrepreneurs from Moshi, Mwanga and Rombo, that were released by the United Nations Scientific Cultural Organization (SIDO).
Makunga said the products that are produced in the country are unable to deal with competition in foreign markets due to the lack of cost in the quality.
The acting manager of SIDO, Larry Arthur has urged the participants to use those trainings for the aim of improving their products so that they can meet competition in the market.
