Monduli member of parliament and retired prime minister, Edward Lowassa, while welcoming the coordinator of various pastors of churches, in various parts of the country, Pastor Ency Mwalyanzi to the White House of Cromer, in Katavi Region.

Pastor Alphonce Chandeka from the Glory Mlay - Katavi Region has said they have reached that decision to come to Dodoma to meet Edward Lowassa without being pushed forward by anyone.

"There is no single person, even if it is not our bishops, this issue has no difficulty more than the importance of God," said Kamnada.

Kamnada said that those pastors are not from the EAGI branch, Pingping, Kvitova in various parts of the country.
Speaking after welcoming those pastors, Lowassa has denied the allegations made by some people that he has collected the groups to support him while claiming that he has no reason to do that and he has no ability to sponsor those people who have supported.
