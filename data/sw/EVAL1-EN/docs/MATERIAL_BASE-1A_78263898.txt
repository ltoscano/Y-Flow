Ashanti United club has insisted that he will stop the service of the striker, David King'Italia, something that may be a big blow to the port's port.
The assistant coach of Newcastle United, George Kagaruki, has confessed that he is not ready to check the doors for that mid-fielder because he was going on with a contract that is going on with that club.
While confirming the incident, Kihara was given a warning to the opposition club which concern King Mohammed VI of talks with an aim of signing up without following the investigation on the transfer of players from one club to another.
The coach of Dar es Salaam, David Banda (in the picture), has been working hard to sign the club's management to leave a match to sign King'Italia, but he was told it's impossible.
"We are proud to be King'Park and we will not accept to be defeated in any other club because of its presence, the club has a great importance because it is an illustration of his fellow youths and he contributes into the gap of a relationship among the players," said Maina.
