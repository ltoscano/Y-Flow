The technology continues to grow and people have not been satisfied with what seems to be taxed.

An entrepreneur of America who is a Kenyan born in South Africa, Elysee Palace has said that he has realized the technology of high-high-speed buses, "Fenella Mukangala" has come with the idea of making the train that will have a fast speed at high speed buses.

Just after the train was made by a high-speed technology, it will have the ability to leave just after passengers don't see that the train had a great number without waiting for the schedule and as it is to the train stations in the United States.

Elysee Palace has explained that if the technology will be accepted by the headlines, it will have a capacity to carry the passengers from Los Angeles to Antalya, within a half hours when a high speed takes place from New York to China for a period of two hours.

On the explanation of Elysee Palace, many love him as a lot of money, but some officials want to understand the idea on a certain amount, especially after seeing the equipment he did and told how it will work together.
