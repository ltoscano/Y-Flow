Mister Mwaura said that a pose with the rights to the victims can be avoided if an court ICC will curb restrictions, Deputy President and the former journalist.
"There is no doubt or justice which will be available to the victims if that court will continue to marry off the deputy president and therefore we will continue to marry him together with journalist Joshua Nassari to be satisfied by the charges facing the court," said Mister Mwaura.
