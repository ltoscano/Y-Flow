The president of Rwanda, Paul Kagame has exposed his reputation President Jakaya Kikwete for improving the services of Dar es Salaam port to enable cargo that are being transported to Rwanda to reach early more than it was a few years ago.

Speaking with joy when those presidents when they visited the unit to reduce and offloading capacity at the port yesterday, President Kagame said the step that was done is success in Rwanda.

"I would like to give President Kikwete for the success made at the port, work being good (port) in our country," said Rwanda will continue with the partnership that is there between the two countries in order to ensure all citizens benefit from business.

President Kikwete said since he arrived in power, he had visited the port of Dar es Salaam four times, but the first three tour were not happy because of the theft, delays, cargo and complaints that were given to the port.

While it appears to be happy, President Kikwete said the Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA) is supposed to be remembered by succeeding to attain the ones that were unable to diminish.

"Therefore, I would like to hear a good news that is being done here is very happy and there was a bad luck, that ship did not live in 23 days and there is no doubt," said President Kikwete.
