Suluhu is false from Malawi and the silence of Tanzania on October 25th, 2012.

Recently, they have emerged with the conflicts concerning the boundary between Tanzania and Malawi, with these conflicts, is a continuation of the thoughts of the former President of Malawi, to qualify for the whole lake region in accordance with the agreement between the Germany and the British of 1890.
However, after realizing that issue and get different activities, now be clear that Malawi has never been given or put in the ownership of the whole area of Lake Nyasa.
The biggest challenge is that Malawi did not be discussed without being written on non-communicable diseases and therefore it's impossible for how Malawi has been able to get a sharp object in the involved of those agreements and pushing Tanzania to fight against the legality of the agreement instead of the series of agreements.
So as to change when it continues to grow, it is seen that Malawi has continued to succeed in controlling the Germany they have destroyed responsibilities, requirements and pain concerning those agreements.
There are three reasons that make us believe that Malawi or a high level of time is not a player in an agreement of Helman and and also the agreement is not a solution to the conflict between Malawi and Tanzania.
The first reason is that a discussion with Helman and didn't know about Malawi, the south east of the south west of "said East Africa" secondly, those agreements don't know about the ownership of any area of that river, lake or sea.
Likewise, the agreements are not about the borders between the coalition or different countries.
About the concept of contributing borders, the map of the age of 1890, and up to 1930, there were two boundaries which followed up to the east of the southern highlands like a result of the colonial history as a result of a lot of land or land or the community to be postponed if the colonialist.
Because the lake region did not own the year 1890, Germany and the British registered for the year 1914, where Germany was defeated and removed from the whole Tanganyika area after that, England had the ability to decide anything about the ownership of the Lake Nyasa.
However, the documents are saying that there is no decision that took place about that issue, history shows that after independence, President Nyerere did communication to discuss with the Liberian government concerning the ownership of Malawi and Tanzania is a resident of Malawi and Tanzania.
The stall said Mrs Asha "Bambucha while taking a ring on the dais, Yellow FEST has been donated by Germany and Germany, the president of Malawi and Tanzania is the Ambassador of the United Republic of Malawi.
Section of Helman and whose president did not visit and use a fox which is a continuation of the land's land, "said East Africa," which was not a result of an agreement or a politician in the Southern Africa Community, which was not a result of a memorandum of hand over pieces of land conflicts in the country.
Instead of what is part of the explanations about the land-inch width "in East Africa." There is no part of the agreements that involves very close to Malawi, Kenya, Burundi, DRC, Uganda, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique, Mozambique,
Because the lake region did not have ever been taken to go or own every year, the English officials continued to convince him to find him so on every year the truth that they did not qualify for the whole area of that lake.
I have managed to look for a year where he confessed that there is a great shape, and I have discovered that maybe it is in 1936, where the government's report had a section of the class and North West and North East African Community and North East African countries.
It would have been better if the leaders of Tanzania would have confirmed to be careful so that the ideas of the president's ideas instead, the government of Tanzania decided to leave him by hope that it would have happened a chance to discuss with wise leaders or passport.
It is true that those leaders have already come from the authority in Malawi, where the current president is Joyce Fissoo, together with those administrative changes, it's still difficult to see wisdom of this stand if Tanzania will not succeed to make sure that their stand is in Tanzania.
Instead of showing a long distance of a way that were grafted by the referee who plays in Tanzania, it has focused itself more in fighting with no weeds, drinking water and insisted that its citizens living in the neighboring country, the truth is that those rights for Almighty God do not have faith in Malawi, or even the judgment of any authority in the world.
There are two things that can protect themselves or control of rights of removing water and fished together on the side of Tanzania and the first issue is the possibility of strengthening Malawi the community of Mbeya, Njombe and Songea, as the president did not have possible that it does not have been possible.
The second issue, that is possible and it is possible, it is very disturbing, and the judgment heading to Malawi will implement the plans of sustainable destruction of water, fish, and natural resources within the Lake Nyasa.
Because it is clear that Malawi cannot prevent us from getting the rights of drawing water, inspect fish and to do the natural activities in the Lake Region to be careful so as to avoid the possibility of encouraging or not to be used by being given those rights.
The primary issue is that the government of Malawi and Tanzania are required to build sustainable development expenditure in the Lake Nyasa to make sure that these government are supposed to cooperate and serve the world in order to cooperate and serve the world's development activities, instead of buying or vying for water.
Without considering the areas of cooperation together, and without fighting the war, international authorities cannot see the importance of giving the judgment that concern the water catchment areas of Lake Nyasa.
The only thing that can be available is unacceptable and to be told that "I get the first to partner and cooperate in implementing the sustainable plans that you're being forced to accept it."
Some of those issues are preventing illegal fishing in order to protect the environment, to look for research, if the government of Tanzania is easy to show that it needs to implement the primary responsibilities, therefore, it is important to ensure that some of them are required to implement the areas of Malawi.
One of the activities that are being mentioned is the expectations of Malawi wanting to build oil in the Lake Region without caring for the oil and Malawi is the side of the south, east and east, the government of Tanzania has a responsibility to put the objection and to prevent the activities they should continue without the presence of two special contracts for Lake Nyasa.
The first agreement is the one that will follow the sustainable water use and the life of the creatures and the second contract is the one to prevent or control the mining of oil in the lake region and the contracts that Tanzania wants to use in this conflict explains openly about the cleaning of water and lives of natural vegetation.
Lake Nyasa is a lack of clean water and good creatures to the world, which in general they are more than oil or even gold, it is wrong to think that oil is better than clean water and his creation of this article, is called Mwengi.
