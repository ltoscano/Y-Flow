He said religious leaders have a responsibility to stop those acts and to provide education to the community so that the change can believe those people and give them their money for the ones.

"These are very disturbing who are supposed to be in the rainy season, including the citizens who have money, therefore their intention is to help them, give them poverty and wanting to disrupt the current peace," he said.

He added that if those people will continue to do their activities without the government to take action, there is a big possibility of peace and calmness in that province to be stopped.
