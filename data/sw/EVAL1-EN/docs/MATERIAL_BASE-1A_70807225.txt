The council of bishops of a terrorist group in the country (PCT), has been advised to show a book that was signed by the workers in the office of the president at the State House after presenting the names that was made for the appointment of delegates of the special assembly of the constitution.
The chairperson of cooperatives on pastors, Hasheem Mkingie has said that in Dar es Salaam yesterday when he was speaking with the Majira newspaper.
He said that in order to end the crisis that is between the State House and the council, the secretary general of that council is supposed to show that book so that the believers can be able to get the truth about that issue.
He added that if the book is still a good opportunity for bishops continuing to know why it has not given their basic right to others, "said the Secretary General will be unable to show this book and will be taken to the State House so that believers can't be shown by one person, it should be emphasized in details," he said.
Recently, Pickup, made a statement of disappointment with the act of government concerning the appointment of delegates of that parliament because they are among the big religious institutions that were presented in the government as required by the government.
