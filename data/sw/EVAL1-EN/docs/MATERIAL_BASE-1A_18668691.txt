From the coming from the police, the government will make him do?
Frode Dyrdal of 28, 2013.

The directive by the Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda to the security agencies to sign the citizens instead of killing them and getting them to the law, he would have been allowed to see citizens who have not been accepted by our security officers so that every police and security officers will be allowed to win the citizens on the excuse of beating the citizens on the pretext that they are not allowed.

His directive was received with great joy by the members of parliament who they seen as they had already been released by members of parliament who refused to hear that the directive did not support CCM members or those who registered themselves because the police had been directed to him that the police did not want jokes in parliament.

It is in continuing to think about this directive and its effects on how to be released, I have found themselves when I'm with a political leader, a activist or normal person who agree with what the prime minister wanted them to stop what I had promised or let him leave it?

When I continued to fall in my thoughts, I found himself as a leader of the political party or a person being able to address citizens who want to address the police acts if I think about how it will be like the person they have told these citizens about the following things?

As a result of being defeated by the police like wild animals, he decided to inform the citizens that they are a human being and they have told the citizens that if they believe it is difficult, "he told the citizens that if they believe it is difficult," he told the citizens that they are marrying them and therefore they thank the citizens that they are inspiring.
Citizens being attacked by if there is no other way of his opposition to convince him to inform the citizens that if the police are living without a primary reason and they refused to answer him or to explain the reason to get into a house or a human being.
