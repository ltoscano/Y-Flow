The Easter festival of this year is expected to bring challenges to the gospel music artists in the country because this situation is allocated by the decision of the organizing committee to give an opportunity to the gospel music stakeholders to give recommendations of several things for the purpose of that festival.

Poachers of things that are required by stakeholders is together with artists who are supposed to provide entertainment at the festival, the guest of honor and the provinces that want to happen.

According to the organizers of the organizers, one of the things that have been recommended by stakeholders of gospel music is the presence of a big number of artists from outside the country, compared to this year's number of artists who have ever participated in that festival for the past years.

The chairman of the organizing committee, Alex Msama said that, that is one of the challenges that at the moment they need to face.

"This is not for the benefits of only viewers but even to the music artists, they receive the opportunity to learn from other artists from outside the country and also to build their friendship," said Msama.

Furthermore, Msama is taking this opportunity to request those artists who will get an opportunity to entertain at the Easter festival of this year to prepare to give clean entertainment.

"This is another position that our gospel music artists can be able to prove out their ability, after there, there is also a probability that others get artists for calling you here outside the country so that they do work with the gospel music," says Msama.

The Easter festival of this year is expected to involve the musicians from the South African countries, Kenya, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Zambia, Malawi, Rwanda, Rwanda and the host Tanzania.
