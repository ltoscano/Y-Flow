And our correspondent, Tarime.

The government has urged the employees of the minerals sector to be calm while it continues to work on their complaints on the benefit of the Social Security Fund.
It has said that currently it is preparing a special procedure, that will enable members of that fund to get their benefits after finishing their service at the work areas.

The Minister of Labor and Employment, Miss Gaudensia Kabaka, said this yesterday when he was speaking to the workers of the gold mine of North Mara, that is owned by the African Baray Gold company (Aclati), during his tour in that mine.
In Tarime District, Mara Province.

He said their complaints will be given priority so as to be given a solution as possible where authority of management and control of Social Security Regulatory Authority (SSRA), is in efforts to look at how members who have been registered in the pension fund if they can be used in the procedure of putting and borrowing.

"The government will meet SSRA together with stakeholders in the minerals sector on January 7,2013 in Dar es Salaam city, so as to get their ideas on the issue of benefits, employees in that village will be represented by their party in the pace," he said.


He added that the government does not be fast on that issue but it wants to listen to the thoughts of all the members of all members, especially the members of parliament and different stakeholders in order to get the views that will be dealt with.

Miss Kabaka said that the government will listen to us to know what they would like to know, in matters of social security because the law and policies are not a mid-fielder thus it can change because of the relevant needs.

In that tour, Miss Kabaka visited various community projects being funded by that mine which is the construction of a new school and a huge renovation of Nyangoto Center.
