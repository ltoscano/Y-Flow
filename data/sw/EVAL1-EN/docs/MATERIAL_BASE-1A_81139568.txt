Over more than 4,000 farmers in the area of Noma in Mkonkole area, he said that Mount Meru has started a factory to create employment due to the increase in discrimination.
According to the chairman of the group Mister Patrick Mwemezi Ngemera, the idea of making alcohol was started in 2014 after discussions between members and farmers.
"The Revolutionary Party of Meru, Banana lake region started as the ordinary party to look for the market of bananas to its members.
"After several years we decided to look for alternative ways to help our farmers because the challenges of getting the market is needed," said Mister Rished.
He added that the farmers of banana area, many times have a great loss due to being involved in a long time and in the end the spread of their crops.
