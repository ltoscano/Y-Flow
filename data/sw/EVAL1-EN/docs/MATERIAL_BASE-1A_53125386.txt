Yesterday, the Minister of Finance, Henry Rankings, who arrived in front of the committee explained that the government is not able to pay 68 billion shillings as reported in the media outlets claiming that the amount of 1 billion shillings is not true.
He said that though the 18 contract of the projects have been signed between the year 1997 and 2004 they lost 562 billion, it's only two companies that had been reduced by the commission of ethics (EPOC), "said Mister Rwangisa.
