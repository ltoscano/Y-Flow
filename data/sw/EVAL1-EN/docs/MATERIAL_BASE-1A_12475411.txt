Bishop, when I want to read, "I want to know what he has done," Masau boasted.

It is not expected, in a normal state, that the bishop of the church can say that I am happy to say I am happy to say when I am happy to say you're very happy, if the coach is using a phone with the call of Kilwa road, which is a love song.

It has been a normal issue to the mobile phone companies, they will lead them without even their customers to know or stop every kind of customers, I will also know how his phone has no phone when they receive the phone.

This is a break to the most basic right of the customer, if there is a song or a message of the client, it gives the person the song or a message, it's also a song or a message that you can be used by using his phone as a poster.

If we leave a problem and stranded, can get a mother of people who is told by the bishop that she would like to be careful, because "I don't know" and he would like to see him, "maybe if your soul wants you," there should also be careful not to know it.

For example, he has not identified himself, and Abdul maneuvered and called a person and then the song he knows, "I wish him," I wish him, "I wish him what happens when her brother then I hope to understand what happens.

Phone companies are doing very big business in the country, and decoration in the country and sometimes are misleading to the people who believe they get to their agents in the government, they did not have enough tax.

Now, if you lead you about the hearts by giving us all the songs that will enable them to inform us that sometimes they produce the feelings of faith so we must ask the communication authority, TCRA, so he knew what he knew what he knew?
