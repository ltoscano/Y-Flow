A contract of road roads is controlled.
The government will hand over the management of road construction to financial institutions so as to end the corruption that has been run in that important economic sector.
Yesterday's report from the ministry of roads and the construction that was correct by the minister, Michael Kamara or said that those organizations will be making contract and follow up with the important criteria for the construction of the construction have been advised.
In addition, the new direction will ensure that the contract will not be paid in the phase which for now they will be advised before those roads be completed.
"We have been running a contract for the phase which its contracts are given out for the road phase which have not been built. This situation has enabled us to be contract because our work needs and ask for himself so that they get the contract to work," he said.
Mister Kamau said that the contract works will be given banks and will be appointed to manage that new policy, while being the responsibility of the bank concerned to ensure that those funds are unsuitable for corruption.
"At the moment, the Barclays Bank has given the implementation of this new policy and the National Bank which will launch the implementation of this new policies which will enable the important phase of several projects which for now is expected to be launched," he said.
Mister Kamnada added that previously the contract they have been following the contracts that they agree especially in making sure they have remained in the projects he was given out and is running a special phase.
That step aims to prove that the challenges that have been being raised by stakeholders that they pass most of the roads that are partnering with the engineers to resolve resources through a poor work that comes to the taxpayer tax for a short period of building the road at a short time.
