It was claimed that Mister Okoye used his authority badly by reducing 50 percent fees for the two companies from Jaffar Idd, and Quality Center which is equivalent to TShs. 57,800 shillings under the board of the board of TBS.
Janeth claimed that Mister Museveni did that is against the TBS procedures and the companies to get the benefits of that amount of money.
In the second phase, it was claimed that on the date due to the reduction of taxes, Mister Netanyahu claimed that the TBS succeeded to get a loss of that amount of money.
