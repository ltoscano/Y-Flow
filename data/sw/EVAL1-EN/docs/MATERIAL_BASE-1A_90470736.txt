This is not an issue of joy?
December 25, 2013.

The Assitant Minister of Agriculture, Food and Cooperatives, Rose Kamnada has told the parliament that we are doing the agriculture to cause poverty and not to deal with the seasons of hunger.
For sure, he has said that most of us who are in the decisions like parliament, we have been discussing on our sessions to be officially confirmed, it is obvious that there is a problem in our system of improving agriculture in the country.
We have been seeing the complaints by farmers from every corner of the country, these complaints are a sign that the concerned ministry has loosened his responsibilities.
It is enough to hear every year farmers came out from every corner of the country, it's better if these complaints will be used to farmers just because there are complaints.
Unfortunately, this complaints have been standardized as a lot of small-scale farmers while these children have been getting exploited by some of the companies that use the production, drugs, and drugs.
For sure, there are bad symptoms about lack of keenly the agricultural sector in the country, clear that for example, we have met the parliamentary debates recently when they woke up the source of parliamentarians.
The report against this company comes with reports from India, that in that country more than 1000 farmers have been selling every month, due to the reduction of debts that were piled up due to the debts that were piled up due to the effects that are produced by MTVEMA.
That in India, already the small-scale farmers of 1200 have been reported to criminals in the country for those reasons.
We've advised that before doing big decisions like this, evaluation and research will take place about companies like this issue that will come to be involved in our agriculture so that they can witness our-day farmers to witness our-day farmers.
