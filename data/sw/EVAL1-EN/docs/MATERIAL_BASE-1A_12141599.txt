Madam RITA is called me 'I was born in the small town! "

The R & B director, Rita Paulsen AKA Madam Rita has said he is among the women who got pregnant while having a small age but he used to deal with the situation until he succeeded.

Through Facebook, Madam Rita has urged the girls who understand themselves in that condition and not giving up because they still can succeed.

"One thing is not knowing about me, I got pregnant when I was a very small age to our community, but I did not see me in my life, but I didn't see me and today, I was not happy and should not be your first commandment," said Rita.
