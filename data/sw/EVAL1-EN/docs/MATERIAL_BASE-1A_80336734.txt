The coach of Liverpool will lead the upcoming poets!
Air crafts are forced to get married which will get you to get the holy martyr, where Liverpool will be forced to fly the upcoming striker, Raheem Sterling to sign him after the new report hit the England's newspaper about his movements.
The big Taarab newspaper and rumors in the country, Ambassador Ombeni Sefue has released a report that, Sterling visited the entertainment house in London City up to nine o'clock in the morning and brought together with his colleagues in the England national team.
"Those accusations do not have any importance to Raheem because it is a young man to play football. It is bad, if a young man of 19 years, if he cannot get him from six days before the following match.
There's no surprising matter because he has the freedom to pay him in the field and to me he does not have any problem, "she said.
