While in Israel, where more than 70 students from Kenya have received training on modern farming, the president explained how their skills will be important in the implementation of agricultural projects that are continued by the Jubilee government.
"In fact, the country can be dependent, where we are determined through this country (Israel) are land than any area of Kenya but see what they are producing," he said.
In the areas of Ranaldo and gefarnate that there is a food shortage, especially maize, nationally, farmers are worried that those projects may cause food prices should be avoided in the near future.
Their fear arising from that although the government will be using modern practices which have reduced the cost of production and therefore, reducing the price of food, those farmers are still using cultural practices which are expensive.
Its results are that they will have a loss if they are supposed to sell their produce at a high price while the government will be selling its crops on the market.
In North A area, farmers have presented a request to the government to reduce the level of land that will be used for those projects.
The government has invested 75 billion shillings in search of 500 hectares from Galinoma who was in Kiliberali has been the first phase in the purpose of buying 10,000 hectares by using modern tools.
