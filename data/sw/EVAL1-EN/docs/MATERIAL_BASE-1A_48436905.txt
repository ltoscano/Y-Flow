Jihadist has conned someone who uses my phone.

There is a person who bought my phone with two sim cards, Tigo (77196) and Airtel (4711,046) since the day before yesterday and he is using the number to sell money for people whose names are in the list.

He claims that I have a problem, I request that support him and he gives the amount of money to be used because there are few who have been stolen, and others wanted to confirm if it is me, they did not receive.

Those who know my phone number have asked through my mobile phone, they believe that you've never thought and do not understand the money and let me know what the money is not by me, they should give me completely.
