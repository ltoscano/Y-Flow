TUCTA is the least being under the worker at 750,000 shillings.

While President Jakaya Kikwete was expected to address the workers at the peak of World Women's Day (May first) at Uhuru Stadium, Dar es Salaam, the Federation of staff for workers (Tucta), has called on the government to increase the least worth 750,000 shillings.

The secretary general of Tucta, Nicolas Mgaya said yesterday that they need to see employees getting a low level that does not meet needs.

He said that due to the drop in the value of a shilling and the huge inflation rate in the moment, that level will be able to meet important needs for the poor workers including accommodation, food, food and health needs.

In the real situation, we see the way the prices of important things including electricity, water, oil, the cost of construction equipment, food houses and other affordable houses have been struggling for a recent years, but there is no way that takes place to bring relief to workers.

Basically the fine is to be included, so as to meet the needs of the life of this time, "he said.
