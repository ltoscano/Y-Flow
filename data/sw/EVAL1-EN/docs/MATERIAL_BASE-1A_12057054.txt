Ridhiwani to vie for a parliamentary seat in Chalinze.

November 3, 2014.

Member of the National Executive Council (NEC) of CCM, Bagamoyo District, Coast Province, Mister Ridhiwani Kikwete, has emerged the winner against his opponents who had given consent to be appointed by the party members of parliament, therefore, I request CCM members to recognize that his victory is not for the member of parliament, Mister Juma Duni Haji, who passed on April 6 this year after the former member of parliament, Mister Saidi Bowman.
