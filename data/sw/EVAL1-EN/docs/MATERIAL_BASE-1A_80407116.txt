Drivers to be careful.
While Christmas season and the new year celebrations were expelled, it gives health workers and passengers to avoid any actions that will be causing the accidents and therefore disrupt the celebrations which are of its own kind.
We have brought together passengers at this matter because it is a probability that if there are congestion of people who want to travel to the farms at the farms, even so, the vehicles that are not allowed to be washed gents for many passengers who want to travel.
The results are that, those vehicles are forced to carry many passengers more than required it is something sad, that on Saturday the only day, five people lost their lives in Nairobi city and I love them.
And as usual, many accidents arose from high speed and drivers not to be careful.
As it is, it's important to remind all the perpetrators, especially the three ones that give up is ahead, but his death is behind and it is behind.
When we increase the national authority for transport and security (NTSA) for its efforts to deal with the workers of transport which do not understand the lives of citizens.
Their report that they have received more equipment for testing the speed of vehicles and also to identify drivers unholiness and the illegal drivers are happy without doubt and those who depend on.
At the same time, we urge our colleagues to celebrate because it is a period of celebrations for a period of time, and the heavy responsibilities of paying for fees and draw of schools among others still wait until January.
Therefore, it is a need to enable you enable you to continue with life after this season.
