The problem of lack of water.
By Mwangi, professor.
The residents of Kiroreli village in Nairobi have benefited from the sponsorship of 74 billion shillings from the World Bank in order to maintain water problems.
Those funds that will be given to the main government as the loan will be built through the mining of dams in the areas of Gothernburg, South and Northern Region.
Other dams will be built in the Lakemikali ward by Melisa.
According to the program, the infrastructure for distribution of that water will be joined by an earthquake in Nairobi in order to solve the problem of lack of water in various streets of the city.
These were officially opened by the senior officials of the government, who visited the dam of Ngewe, to inspect his condition.
The director of water services in the country Mister Lawrence Simwanza said that another person in that project is the French development organization (FGM).
"The money that we will get from FEST will be used to expand the water catchment areas of Ngewe, until the Maasais.
Those money will increase, will be paid without any interest for 30 years but the government has been given seven years before any payments started to be implemented.
This is a meaning that this loan will be used by 2048.
For now, the cost of water to the hosts in Nairobi is 750,000 dollars in a day but the ability of the government to provide water has reached 530,000 shillings.
