The nominated member of parliament for Nzega District, Doctor Hamisi Kigwangala has expressed fears of politics, the heart to believe in themselves and discover themselves as the representative of the citizens and not the representative of his party for the meaning of CCM.

Honorable Kigwangala has prepared a huge demonstrations by involving all the citizens who love the development, these demonstrations have been promised to take place although he has been getting great opposition from CCM because CCM seems not to see his member of parliament following the demonstrations to oppose the issue that is supervised by the government in power because of CCM itself.

Honorable Kigwangala, after announcing the demonstrations, he has got great opposition from the leadership of CCM of his district about preventing those demonstrations, a situation that was done by Honorable Kigwangala at a session of the ethics committee of CCM something that Honorable member of parliament saw that he was not treated too.

Secretary of CCM in Nzega District after seeing that he has decided to send him to him, Honorable Member of Parliament by requesting him to conduct for those demonstrations and later it has been seen on the last minute Honorable member of parliament has emphasized that the protests.

I have decided to thank Honorable Kigwangala for his decisions so as to teach all the members of parliament to be responsible for their votes and not to the party that took place in parliament and here I start getting good deeds for the citizens and not for the political party, Kigwangala, Kangi Lugola and others.

For another time again, congratulations to Honorable Kigwangala by setting up CCM by interests, 'Foolish Age, including CCM members who prevent them to make those demonstrations.

It depends on a copy of the letter that was written by Honorable Kigwangala.
