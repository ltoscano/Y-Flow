I am very happy about registering a soccer federation here in the country together they want here to move forward in competitions of social networks are going here in the country and they have also given an explanation of Simba and Yanga FC.
The semi-finals of the netball competition, Saad Kawemba, has said the schedule will happen if the team of Simba and Yanga will take action against the finals.
If Simba and Yanga will remain in the step.
Semi-finals.
Its meaning is that it is because the schedule of CECAFA was scheduled every day.
By you, you cannot know where the two finals of Simba and Yanga won the two matches at the stadium.
Spread yourself in this problem here to security.
The first match will be defeated after the second match in the second group of God to prevent it will be difficult if there is a team of playing the first game.
Now, you has given me it is that the money for Simba Yanga is going on Monday when he was in the same way, he said on Wednesday.
And Simba who don't like on Tuesday when the semi-finals will play on Sunday.
Therefore, there is a threat of constitutional on Wednesday, I was only two finals but if one among them, he went to the semi-finals stage.
The semi-finals will be played on Tuesday, is as it is in the schedule.
This is the procedure.
With Yanga, it will play the final, he was impressed by the bad news that Ghana will play with the venue which will play with Azam Complex and playing music, it will be between Atletico Madrid against terrorism against my friend.
