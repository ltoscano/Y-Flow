The aim of making peace in the first group of diaspora has been known here in the country which we got in diaspora to wake up, it is compared to the people living in James and those who are in this country.

And it is one of the people that we saw.
Ras Kiduku was married by bad luck and I got an opportunity.
From here, when I was very small and studied in different countries and like ten years ago, I decided to go back here at home to look for us in our country and after that, I saw these opportunities available in the country and after that, I saw these opportunities that are there in the country and after that, I saw the breast and I can enjoy yourself.
The last time was the last time.
