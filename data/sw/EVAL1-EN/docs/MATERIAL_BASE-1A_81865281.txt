The Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA), has started the inspection of buses that are in the provinces that cause huge fare for passengers at the University of Ubungo Dar es Salaam (UBT).
Speaking to this newspaper in Dar es Salaam yesterday, the officer in charge of SUMATRA, East Africa region, Kisukuru.

He said some of the buses are very normal to increase the fare in this festive season and caused a nuisance to passengers.

"The operation will continue until the festive season to be complete because many drivers are increasing the fare so that they can get a lot of money and causing the passengers to get problems," said Sakali.

He added that SUMATRA has been getting complaints from passengers immediately after planting trees so many of them fail to travel due to the fare is high.

He said that since they will start inspecting those buses, many have been seen to from the required levels but if the ones that are at the stations, many buses are increasing the fare without fear.

He urged the citizens to take advantage of buses and warned their agents to stop paying huge fare different from those involved.
