Am, when I got up it was good because it's at the reason we were in two to try to discuss when we go to Dar es Salaam to follow up according to the reason for the reason.
When we get in Dar es Salaam city, we have been able to be paid a lot of agenda and try to be very small and therefore we decided to know it.
And an ancient attack.
When we see you, it can be the agenda which you can and told him which was the first number but the first number was a goal about the open account.
It was about the grave of the business participants.
And I was on the past issues of business so that we can be able to have revenue.
Also, the meeting called so much so that we had to wait for him but it's a number that you have done every month in the month of us so that we can have a total number of two thousand shillings to the disciples of messengers?
As a result of having that bad luck.
We're taking each other to take a big position of five because the name takes a long time, the preparations should come up all over the whole country and that we should take it to the bank.
