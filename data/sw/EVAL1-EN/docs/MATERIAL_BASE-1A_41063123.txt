Senator of Pambani County, Professor John Lilenga, wanted the Minister for Agriculture, Mister Felix Kifu, dismissed from work by announcing the low price of buying their maize from farmers.
While speaking in Sedoyeka, Mister Lerner has said that the minister has failed in his responsibilities in the ministry concerned with the sector that contributes to the economy of the nation.
"The only thing is because if you were sacked by the President Uhuru Kenyatta, because we have the late Uhuru Kenyatta, because we have no faith again because of his decisions that do not be given to the farmers," he said in a press conference.
In addition, the founder called Mister Kengele posing for allowing the maize from the neighboring country of Uganda, saying that action is forced to fulfill the nation's dreams that affects the crops from the citizens contrary to the buying of other nations.
"Now it is clear that Kona was given a priority to the farmers of the neighboring country than the farmers of the country because its benefit is now," he asked.
Before yesterday, the leadership also was surprised that they won't know that all owners of the Mazombe and International Airport (NCB) have been admitted to their maize and even before the Kenyans get their husbands.
"It is clear that there are people in the government who have collaborated with conmen of maize from Uganda to fill the warehouses before the Kenyans have forgotten the crops," claimed Professor Lil.
He said that the price of 2200 shillings in the end of 90 kilograms is limited a lot considering that the farmers used a lot of money at the input and handing diseases, especially Monsigal.
"The cost of paying the maize by one acre in North Rondo is 50,000 shillings. If you sell your farms at a price of Mister Kona, you will get 43,000 shillings," he said.
