"Even though the Maasais' since the beginning of the year has shown an intention of making sure that CBA are implemented at the right time and that the workers are benefiting from those agreements, the supervisors are providing them to address them and put it.
Their reason is that the implementation of those agreements will make sure they get more costs, "said Mister Sadiki.
The secretary requested those supervisors for people not to care about the law while insisting that, the right to appeal for the workers is supposed to abandon their disappearance, while the management of the port intend to refuse houses to protect themselves as they appointed the defending champions of their party as a threat.
The port's supervisors led by chairperson Mister Ofosu Ahenkora has said that the director Gusmao and the secretary general of the Maasais' Simon Sirro, took a meeting of more than four hours in order to avoid disruptions in those important activities.
