The dream of the government and the Revolutionary Party (CCM) to use the road construction project to unite in the provinces of Arusha and Mara that goes through the Serengeti National Park as the capital to pray for votes for the citizens of the Lake Region and the general elections this year is in danger.
"Come back" due to international communities to oppose that construction.
The road with a length of 421 kilometers is expected to start being built in the year 2012 and already they have already been quoted by the media saying the construction of the road through Serengeti National Park is continuing to be part of the implementation of the CCM election manifesto.
"The road is a promise that is in the CCM party manifesto to the voters of the Lake Region, therefore its construction is a must to be discussed," says Minister Mwangira.
He explained that the activists of internal affairs and outside the country that the construction will be keen on professional advice that will be presented before starting that project, "we're very careful with the issue of conservation and that the road project will have effects to the animals from the Serengeti National Park," he said.
Together with the statement of Mwangira, the news that the road could be given more than CCM campaigns in the provinces in this year, "however, many citizens want to travel to provinces in the northern region and even so, many citizens want to travel to provinces in the northern region and therefore many citizens want them to go to provinces in the northern region and therefore many citizens want them to go to provinces in the northern region," Masau boasted.
The report of Citizen newspaper has succeeded to see his use already has been sent to President Jakaya Kikwete and Minister Mwangi, whereby several effects which will be released if the road will be set aside because the road will be set aside because the road will be set aside because the road will be paid among the animals from the Serengeti National Park and the Maasais' in Kenya.
If you sell the 10 million shillings that are estimated to be two million shillings from one reserve to the world, and the event which had many tourists from different parts of the world as well as international media houses, those experts say that the road is expected to have many vehicles from different parts of the world as well as the northern region that will put up people's lives due to the economic activities that are available in the Serengeti National Park.
"The road also will increase human activities that do not match against the requirements of the environment, destruction of environment and also will face a free walk of wildlife in the major reserve," that can be easily read in the report.
Those experts warned that if the government will relocate and insisted that the "road" road-0, "there is dangerous to Tanzania to lose his honor in front of the eyes of the international communities by giving them conservation.
It's not only that, Tanzania will also pay great revenue from the tourism sector that are estimated to reach one million dollars that are owned by the Serengeti National Park for being one of the tourist attraction sites that was given by UNESCO, "says that report.
Those experts in their report are complaining that Serengeti is the only area in the world about the real use of the world as it was in Karatu district, Shinyanga province, and we advise that the road can be built in Karatu district, Shinyanga province, and its length will have 383 households that are in the safeguard.
If the road will be built inside the Serengeti National Park, it will have a lot of 421 kilometers which are very big more than outside the reserve, so as to help the government get better ways to implement the project without considering the effects on the government, "said Bowman.
Apart from those experts, Tanzania has still being faced with great opposition from various activists outside the country about the road project wanting the government to find alternative ways from other stakeholders so as to convince the government to seek opinions from other stakeholders so as to convince the government to look for alternative ways and to leave the government's benefit from the institution.
