The Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda, continues with his tour in Shinyanga province and promised the farmers in that province that the government will be unable to buy the rights of breeders so that they can benefit from their livestock and reduce conflicts between pastoralists and the citizens due to some of the citizens in the first time after receiving the progress of the development that caused electricity in the ward.
Gerson Mchaga answered me from there he is giving me more.
They know things.
A new time.
They are concerned.
He believes that this is a must they must use that opportunity to the acting manager of the Lake Region Development Bank, TANESCO and also giving a lot of progress to the residents of this school, because some of the students will use the power if they will use the power if they will use the electricity at more than four hundred thousand in the district.
There is possible for farmers to be patient with good people as a day, but to his office, the prime minister Mizengo Pinda.
He knew that the threat of hunger is still there because of the shortage of wedding areas, there are four hundred and fifty hundred thousand.
And a cow.
Citizens wanted to ask for him to do well.
The very high level, they start getting ten acres for a whole year, the others that were going to go to the bus I request for the number of cows and famous as I put in the time the police was not true.
That situation is stated that it appears to a major impetus in conflicts between pastoralists so as to keep land and even reminded me that has been built by voting but now the government has reduced.
Animals.
His work will not pollute the talents.
I will be like there is someone who have come about yourself in each other.
God can't know what?
Or prevent it is not on the side of the government.
To supervise, it's not only.
The Lord to stop the acts that is unacceptable, to think they are grateful and he thanked the late.
Today.
