He said that there have been complaints from time to time to patients who are going to get treatment to NHIF cards who appear to get free services.

"The leaders that consider the health sector are required to take action against any service provider to be found guilty, patients are treated through a card," said Mrs Salma.

He said that the treatment services for now is the modern system in other countries in the world and it is the responsibility of every executive director to manage and be implemented in success.

He also urged the security guards especially when they meet with the language that are not easy or see drugs offered by the government are sold at the private sector to give information so that the perpetrators are taken against them.

And the Minister of Health, Transport, Hussen said the government has intended to resolve the plan of the strategy to contribute to health so that everyone can be given treatment due to other people can't pay health services.

By sending, Mwinyi said that for now they have a plan to provide treatment to a card, which everyone will be contributing in a certain amount that will help them to get free treatment.
