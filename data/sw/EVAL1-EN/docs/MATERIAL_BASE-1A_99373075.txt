You must do very much quickly.
You will have a fight with the ball.

Let me see this one here and I will get to the purpose of creating front and in the middle is when someone went out and the ball came up so that I feel extremely honored by you and be able to throw words at each other.
Very few positions in football.
They are required to be there and then.
Pinda has scored one goal that he got two goals.
And we wish him to return to the African competitions for that players.
It is a very big position.

They have you know that you have done those finals on its part, the only player who plays soccer in the country, Sophia Mjema not to hear them, he has said that they have the ability to score against them but they put its support from the league so that women can be able to help a lot of time because we are playing.
If you're players who will be found, we are playing here without there, there is a warning that we are playing up to the streets to end that day and to end that one we have many players.
There is a person who is ready to do everything.
