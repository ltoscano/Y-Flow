That authority said that CBB is to protect themselves because it's delaying the market strategies for the purpose of giving an intention to disrupt the market without a huge benefits.
The E said that in a report that was set aside by her director Miss Lucy Msoffe has said CBB takes a long time to give a license to the organizations that sell coffee, a situation that protects the cargo of coffee that is intended to be sold in the markets of outside.
That director explained that his authority has been faced with a difficult time to fulfill the contracts and farmers of the farmers because the licenses are usually released and other times lack of CBB.
Miss Muruma said there is hope that coffee is with the ability to lead in making sure he bought 23 years if stakeholders will work together.
"At the moment, the E is between 35 contracts and farmers about the sale of coffee and despite having a modern market, CBB is why the contracts are attained for approximately six months every year," he said.
In that situation, he said that the political parties will destroy the leaders of organizations and political parties because the farmers pay for permission to fulfill their punishment.
