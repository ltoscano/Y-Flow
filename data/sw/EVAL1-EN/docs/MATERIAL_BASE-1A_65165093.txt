The representative of the parliament of Kakopi Kapama, is wanted by the police force for being involved in an act of misuse of gun.
The representative was wrecking your woman in Kisenga.
The member of parliament from he said a small group of Taliban militants, is alleged to have forgotten that woman out of one bar which seems to have shown the money for debt.
The woman by the name Dorah Makele says he has been admitted to the Victoria hospital with bad injuries he has emerged after the representative entered the pelvic regions and his car before falling on earth.
Miss Obrey Chirwa has said that the representative went to his car and got 6,173,433 votes that he shot in the air before falling down and broke down.
"When I fell, I went back back quickly and get inside the vehicle and read for my clothes not being used by the car," he said.
"He termed it by the vehicle when he was running," said Mrs Owino during an interview with journalists in bed in the hospital, Victoria.
That woman wants the police to take action by leading that representative. He has bad luck in the legs and in the pelvic regions.
"He refused to pay the value of the alcohol that they have lost its friends because he didn't have money through her friend who was also among those who were using alcohol that had asked me to pay for the money more than one month," he said.
And a picture.
