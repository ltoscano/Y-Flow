I request that request to deal with buoys.
By Bashir Yakub.
At the junction of Chakwama, Boniface Jacob, the guest of honor here that he did in him, he is faced with buoys and shivered because he removed his criminal acts by checking his photos in the newspaper.
But instead of switching off your eyes, the relatives have found themselves on foot when she was attacked by a group of residents wanting to marry off.
Let me be said that when he met with the journalist and asked him for what the officer shot him in one newspaper of every day that happened in the theft.
Because the residents were affected by the behavior of those brothers to resolve their properties, they arrested him and helped me to marry Rachel because they were not seekers.
However, the police officers arrived immediately and arrested the person before they were removed by the public.
