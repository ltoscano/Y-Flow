By Deus Kibamba, Dar es Salaam city.
I am in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Dar es Salaam which is popular as it is in other estates of such terms, Livingstone, and Pemba which could be used in many business.
Pemba Island has been popular as a result of many youths to cooperate with thugs and do business close to the Kariakoo market.
When you get your phone from any place in the city of Pemba, the real situation will be sold but you're with him in the same way.
That is as a same as a large extent that is famous by selling equipment in the vehicles that were stolen, if you want to be sold at a good price, if you want to take free, you can be able to see him even though they are witnessed.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo together with many houses, the locals are sold, now they have risen up with stories but business that are run is "the lives of people."
If the government will not be looking at two eyes, that business does not benefit us.
This area just came up to be sold for the tires of high prices since every corner of this world.
This is when I received and worried that the leaders we have given priority to lead this country have a good intentions and our life, vehicles have enabled us to put in the high level or for a famous second thing.
If you allow the tires, the government may come in our General Projest Riders in order to begin working for us to avoid the problem of those tires.
The most importantly, this nation had a good intention to start an example of clothes, every province had its factory especially they use the cotton.
But for leaders who were left to him after retiring from him, they decided to leave him and now we are witnessing second-hand-hand clothes to be defended by us.
