In a tennis player from within and outside Tanzania, we are expected to compete in the river and Lusillile so that they are expected to take place in Gymkhana grounds in Dar es Salaam city, let me be accountable because they are the hosts of those competitions.
The month of eight in the competition of youth under ten years of four and two and two have not seen in Tabora a big one.
When we go to Dar es Salaam, there are African East and Central Africa out of the neighboring country outside the neighboring countries that they are suffering from a very big farm here and we are also trying in plenty.
You miss.
The Almighty God is that of knowing that who is playing for separation when you commemorate the competition.
Until the end of this year we know how many times that we do?
Maize will make sure we use but he does not have?
That competition will involve youth from Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and host Ethiopia.
