18 soccer coaches in the country, have finalized training on one week at the Big Seasons Hotel, Mombasa, that was led by Hanscana.
The training was sponsoring by those new coaches which have been invented by the International Federation of International (NBS) and also to promote those coaches to go hand in hand with the new laws.
"It is a must that Kenya is supposed to do a time if it wants to make more steps in boxing and it is a must for coaches to understand the law and new procedures of getting a ring," said Mwaya.
After that training, those coaches were held the examinations where those who qualify will be able to be taken to the bridge to the level of the first star (Star One coach).
According to the new law, there is no coach that has been allowed to take care or to demonstrate to the team at the international competition to be a certificate of starting that level or more.
Inside here in the country, it is only three students, Albert Matito, Geology, TaSolo, "Oreo 'and Patrick Othiako who have graduated from the level of 3-fielder which is a high level that is attacked by him.
