The system of the management of the artists in Tanzania has been a long time for both sides, artists think about those who are calling the managers while those managers live in one way or another.

Following that debate, the veteran musician, Professor Jay has given his advice to Tanzanian artists through the program of Doctor Jump Mtingwa (5-5), has advised the artists not to be interfered with under the managers who do not have that profession, who are the management of the management in the criterion of having money to help the artists.

"You know most of Bongo Flava artists we have not want to do these activities themselves so that most of them close to people living in their homes but they don't know that you are headed to Gongo la Mboto because it is in home," said Professor Jay.

The rapper who has released a new song "third dirty," has explained that manager is a person who is supposed to have a lot of money from and doing a lot of time as soon as possible and that many Tanzanian artists have been going on the hands of people with money that do not have the management profession.

"He cannot get a manager to wait for forgiveness from that phone, he would understand Professor Jay to Kahama," that is not the manager.

So, so many groups are people with their money because the lack of artists not to stay in music and wanted to know where I don't want to know but you can't know what you have lost, "explained Professor Jay.

He has said that, it is a reason that made him to be a manager and instead they have the friends that they can help as friends instead of having a manager what he did is to pay the cost of their husbands.

"That is why we become a lot of artists who want to do music because they are very few so that these are few artists to move here and we want to go here and we want to go to International here and we want to go to International.
