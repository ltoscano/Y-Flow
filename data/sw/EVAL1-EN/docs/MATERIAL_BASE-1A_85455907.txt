He wanted the servants of different levels starting from the District Council to the nation, to implement their duties by making sure the government plans are implemented.
Moreover, Mbijima has urged the national union to avoid political politics by protecting politics from the region, discriminating on religious politics and color, because by doing so, it is same as informing enemies who would like to destroy the nation and stop in violence.
