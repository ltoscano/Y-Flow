Chelsea coach, Jose Mourinho, has said their opponents, Manchester City have got a lot of success since it was taken by Sheikh Mansour.
City won the FA Cup in the year 2011 and won the premier league championship in 2012, but they have been able to cross the group stage in the champions league immediately in three trials.
"They took the match only with several cups," said Mourinho before their away match on Monday against City.
"Their team is good, the squad is good and it's normal and it's supposed to win a lot of awards," he said.
Mansour's driver, one of the siblings of Abu Dhabi's family, has used more than 700 million pounds in signing up players since he was defeated in City and to make the club missing from international players like David Bruns and Yaya Toure.
"In Europe City did not do well, or to look at doing well," added Mourinho.
"We go to the center, they carried out a lot in the champions league in two seasons and also in the Europa League," he said.
