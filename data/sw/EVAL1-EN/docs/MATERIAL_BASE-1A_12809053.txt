The Member of Parliament for Mesa, Mister Jacob Macharia Irungu has asked the leader of the charges at the International Criminal Court, Miss Fatna Benoni, he threw out the case facing President Uhuru Kenyatta, and the Deputy William Ruto, claiming that the cause of violence in the 2007 general elections have already been revealed.
Speaking at the Old Trafford stadium in an event to celebrate the heroes memorial area, who represents the area of the year 2007 / 2008, he said that there does not have a lot of violence after the year 2007 / 2008, he said that there is no need for the case to continue though they have shown an intention to forgive me those involved in violence.
"All of us understand that this area was faced with a lot of violence against climate, but at the moment you are affected so that the case continues again, they can see how we can make progress in development," he said.
The Member of Parliament told me that he will give him a letter from that leader who did not want a letter on behalf of the investor to have been banned from his parliament as he wanted that case to be emphasized.
In addition, he urged the residents of his region to prevent them from poor politics and instead they fell on the issues that will bring development to the community.
