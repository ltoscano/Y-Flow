The tragedy of.

It is at 11 o'clock in the morning, he writes that child who was supposed to be primary schools for a way to have ever been able to take a cow as they get 20 kilometers from their home ground living.
There is where enough areas for Hudugu Ng'amilo; at least they go down in the evening usually have the ability to provide several machines for milk and he will get one liter of taking home where his mother sell them and got to at least they get treatment at that day.
I have been forced to write this article without mentioning the village so as to put up the value of this story and prevent people to marry off without stopping.
This child (Ezekiel) is not a full name and is used to live in that procedure since he started believing in the small age of it, while his mother gets a person who doesn't have the ability to do it is same as the father's guardian of their native houses in that village.
.
A long distance from the village, this child is there in another village where there is a primary school, where a children will be forced to travel long distances to school and they have a lot of time to arrive at school where the heavy rains benefited from their homes.
Between the village and schools there are the valley that flood with water at long time times, children do not return to school because of the canal to provide information, where by good Samaritans you need to use it.
A distance from school to home has caused children to eat with heavy rains and when they arrived at the school they are forced to rise and rains to be unable to consider well in their studies.
On his part, the biological mother to Ezekia Wenje, get a lot about her life in the village and another time we found themselves with a lot of things and see how the world has risen up without any success and to have a strong desire to make land.
