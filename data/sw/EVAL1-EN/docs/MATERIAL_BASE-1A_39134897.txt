Now I am a friend.

Assa Mwakilembe that doesn't know the elderly and motorbike riders, this is for my brothers.
Shangani, this is according to my brothers.

It is my hope for you and you are going on well with your daily activities, but I am not seen in the same time when we did not hesitate to communicate with my colleague, but also it is good to understand that I have been released in the province of Marangu.

After the wedding I came out on my opinion polls to look for money, and as you know that the business here in the country has emerged so much, and people find the one to look for markets and that there we are fighting with the center without a problem.

My husband bless you to let me get into logging inside you, but after addressing them, we agreed to continue to work hard and to put up a long time so that we can also get time to write and put everything here in America.

I request for us to apologize for all who came out and not preventing themselves on my wedding, but I want to confirm to that we are together.
