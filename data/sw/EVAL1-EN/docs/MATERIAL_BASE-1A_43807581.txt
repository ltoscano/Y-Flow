Kawambwa you can eat with what is there?
I asked me.
It is Never Ending.
Ukawa and that there is no thing we are preparing to sell the rains or there is sun there if you know it's not the Lord 'with eight so much, whoever does not lie!
However, he doesn't know yesterday, everything is there.
It's not saying that for now, educating the children the way you get to school, that is "Nakula Ujana" and I don't have faith and now I do not have faith and now I do not know how the Lord does not know how it will be the late.
I have heard the ones that are expected to eat, eating a little thing and now it is not using what they believe.
We ask for us to do business.
We do not want the business people from Nairobi city now I'm with four children I am happy with.
And mothers who like a sister, Dina Marios and namo Jumatatu wakuu wa Marekana, make sure you know how to Monday, on date seven, you will discover children of Ongea Bure Dealis.
That is the date eight hours I see it is the ones where one can't jump inside, and to start what is in one of the first five weeks to form one in the more schools or the school.
You know it is being eaten by the second name.
Therefore, it is not English, the Almighty God bless you like this one, or if I can, you can be depending on the person his lover Ruth Meena.
The late God know everything is with a program.
