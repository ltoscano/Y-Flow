The Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (Corefa) has been requested to increase the availability of money that he has been tested in order to strengthen primary infrastructure and to reduce poverty in that he said.
The Governor of Pambani County, Simon Kachumu has urged the government to ensure that resources are coming back so as to strengthen the market so that the citizens can get enough services.
While speaking during the tour of Pambani County, that Governor said that there is a need for the communication commission of resources in the country to do an inspection in all the wards in the country so as to identify the needs of every citizen.
"It is good for the fact that it is not known so that the citizens can get the government services," said Doctor Robert Kachumu said that he said there are others who had a lot of money while others carried out a little money so that state can be condemned.

He said that if that method, it does not recognize the truth of problems which have already been different from it, he said most of them have continued to get problems because of receiving a low quality.
