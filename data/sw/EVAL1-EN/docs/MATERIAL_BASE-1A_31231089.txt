Perhaps Kenya could have lost more than 1208 every day as a result of the ban of Miraa Cargo in European nations, especially in England.
This is after the case that was presented by the British farmers in London City to oppose the ban that was taken by England against the selling of that product in that country, the farmers lost the first time on December 30th. The farmers lost the first case in December last year.
While speaking with the journalists yesterday in Majogoo village, Bugandesis', chairman of supervision, Dickson Pupa (KMKEWAWa), Mister Dumila, said his party has qualified for the step of that court.
He said that party will not be resolved since it will contribute a case at the European Human Rights Commission (TANAPA). "He said before that party to take that step, the President Uhuru Kenyatta together with the government of Mount Meru, must make sure that agriculture and Mchuchuma business will be avoided.
However, he congratulated the president and the local government of Meru for helping them to pay for the cost of those cases, saying that donation is the best to continue being released until when those efforts will not give them fruits.
"Although we have not succeeded in our intention of ensuring that the ban was removed, we are grateful to the president and the government of Mount Meru for contributing to the cost of our case," said Muthir said.
Also, he described the contribution of the parliamentary committee on the Mafia District committee headed by the representative of women of Mount Meru, Mrs. Florence Mwanri, which was done by the England Parliamentary Committee about that issue.
