Shame is a shame for Johannesburg city.
By Bashir Yakub.
The High Court in Mombasa yesterday announced a case against the Governor Hassan Ali Johannesburg, (in the picture) to be taken to the chief justice so as to give the direction.
Judge Edward Marks said that there is a big constitutional issues in that case if the lawyers of all sides explained about it and that they can be dealt with by a panel of three judges.
"I agree with all the sides that there are very important issues in this case which should be allowed to consider the chief justice to sign a panel of judges to address," explained Judge Lubricants.
Judge Lubuva has not heard that questions, although those can be dealt with by one judge and he does not have a need to vote on both sides that those issues can be dealt with by a panel of judges.
The lawyers of the Freight Company at the Chamakemikali ward, William Mogele and Mohammed Alef Sherief the president of Johannesburg City, Paul Chagonja together with Lawyer Kelley Mwitasi.
"The case has been able to cost resources of the court's department and all of us have agreed that there are heavy political issues that are supposed to be dealt with by a panel of judges," he explained.
Two judges, Mary Lugusi and shivered because they have already succeeded to listen to that case and now Judge Mtunga will be required to select other judges outside the court of Mombasa.
Mister when I went to Doctor Mutta as a panel of judges who came to listen and decide against several constitutional issues in that case which he claimed that Johannesburg City had a degree in January 31st, 2013 and that he did not qualify to vie for the seat on January 31st, 2013.
