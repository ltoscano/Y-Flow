The commission gives the price of oil.
And that is not true.
The Commission for energy in the country (ERC) has defended his action of reducing the price of oil for little money, contrary to the expectations of many Kenyans.
The commission says that the price of oil does not benefit from the oil prices which have not been accepted, because there are other issues of basically the way it is considered.
The news published yesterday in the press yesterday says that fuel that are spread in the country is not that which has not been accepted.
"Kenya does not pollute the oil that has not been accepted, which its price is under it.
Therefore, we must look at all the costs we are getting in the transportation of oil that have been accepted, "says the report.
That situation is as a result of the end of the activities of purification of oil in Kenya Petroleum Bulk Procurement Agency (KPK), that is in the area of Changalawe Mafoto area of Mombasa since September last year.
For now, Kenya is requesting one of the oil that have already been approved, and that takes a high price compared to those that have not been accepted.
That commission clarified that even the purchase of oil takes place between 30 and 45 days before oil to arrive in the country.
"For example the fuel that were used to plan the current oil prices in the country was bought for October this year, it means that the current price of oil in petrol stations in the country, is going so as well as issues were taken as in October in the international market," he said that report.
At that time, one barrel of electricity in that market in ASM Oran Club was 8736 dollars.
Oil that ended the month of 60 million for one barrel will be used by Kenyans in February next year.
ERC is saying that the price is owned by the value of one million shillings during the purchase.
