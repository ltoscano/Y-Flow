It cares for the children living in a clean environment.

By Rachel George.

The community has been advised to care for the children living in difficult environments especially in the villages so that nobody would recognize them and be pregnant as they are now.
The Director of Women's National Development Party (Tadu), Miss Mwanaisha Mbijima has said that in Dar es Salaam the day before yesterday when speaking to the press.

He said the big problem of children moved to the city is due to the community when he did not see the importance of caring and protecting themselves.

"Some of the children are rushing to the city due to each other who are getting in the communities around them and causing them to maintain the city and get more problems," he said.

Miss Mbijima has urged the community to get pregnant in the children instead of ensuring they get all the important services that they need to receive, to give them a good foundation of life.

"Parents should stop the habit of using children such as a way of getting income instead they should narrate to you and ensure that they are going to school, the Ministry of Social Development, Gender and Children will do a lot of challenges they are facing the children," he said.
