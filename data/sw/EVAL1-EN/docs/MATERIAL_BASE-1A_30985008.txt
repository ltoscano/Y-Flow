A recent report in some of the newspapers reports indicate that the police force in the special region of Dar es Salaam, and 23 citizens of Burundi in the country.
Those citizens have been impressed by the mistake of entering and living in the country against the law.
They have been arrested on August 20 this year, the Magomeni-Kagera region, Kinondoni District, in Dar es Salaam city, are currently sheltered at least getting visitors.
Among them, one of the children, one of the age of five and another five years.
It is not the first time for the arrest of foreign citizens in the country in a big group, without a permit for there.
These events of the arrest of these citizens from Burundi and others are the good work of the police on one side.
On the other side, it is clear that you are supposed to be responsible for other media stations in the country.
On that logic, although the arrest of success is a place of success but the great success is to prevent the problem.
According to the confiscation of this kind, they are made that the important message is continuing to come out and that the border is not satisfactory.
