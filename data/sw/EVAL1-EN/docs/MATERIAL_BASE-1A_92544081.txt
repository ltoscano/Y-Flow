It is a 10 kilometer budget.
Petit 14, 2013.

Thursday this week, Minister of Finance, Doctor William Mgimwa, will visit the government's budget for the financial year 2013 / 2014, being its second budget in that position and it is the third budget since President Jakaya Kikwete entered his second term.
Also, this is a budget for safe water (or by her dancers as a budget of the injured) for the second phase of President Jakaya Kikwete, because it only had only one budget for the financial year 2014 / 2015.
It is possible that there are a lot that has been improved on this year's budget compared to the past years but without doubt, there are other things that will continue to be in mind or any other reasons.
This unique budget is safe for Kikwete is the one that can be used as the previous vision to test its efficiency and the government that got to form, since he came to power in the year 2005.
One of the sure is that, all the previous budget for several decades ago, they have been carried out by smoking cigarettes, soda and other alcoholic beverages.
And another big issue is also a lot of ministries to make sure that one budget of enough budget as it has been sponsored by Parliament and the primary questions is, this budget is safe and do not ask for what way?
Do you get more buyers and cigarettes, cigarette and alcohol as usual?
So, it is a budget to support tax exemptions even so that without the need and in the previous budget, we have never been informed that the priority of the budget is education, but education is the one that lasted for the first time, results of form four in the year 2012 and been canceled due to the first time.
When we asked himself the priority of this year's budget, I will be given a chance by considering that it had not been ordered for our priority is education and that despite the priority of the budget for this year we are not good for our colleague, listen to the budget then meet your responsibility.
