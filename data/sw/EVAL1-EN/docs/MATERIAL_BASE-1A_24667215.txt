Africa appears to be bullied.
The debate has the servant in the African leaders to be the International Criminal Court (ICC) owned up to the nations of this continent which ended up to this year.
For another time, Kenya is leading in ensuring that issue should be discussed at the conference of members of ICC, popularly known as ASP Masoko.
The efforts in Kenya were led by the embassy of Kenya in the United Nations (UN) who are supervised by Mister Macharia Irungu.
In his communication with the council of ASP, Mister Kamau explained that the intentions of Kenya did not believe that their citizens are faced with charges of the court but it's because of the need to have more better ways of ensuring that the court is going on.
"It is a condition ASP in use on the regulations of the court so as to prevent the bad use of the court through this way to prevent the lack of rights," said Mister Kamama, when he was addressing the issue that be discussed at the conference hall.
In Kenya, it has also claimed that until now it has been difficult to continue with the cases of other leaders in the court and therefore it needs the regulations to be taught in order to deal with that situation.
However, that court has been very disturbing due to the claims that it is used badly by the Western nations to buy the authority of leaders and freedom of African countries.
The spokesperson of that court Funding, El Abdallah said cases that involve African countries are in that court because the government will continue to focus on charges of crime from those countries.
"ICC has not mislead the African continent for the investigation that had been done in African countries because those countries itself are the ones who wanted ICC so as to investigate it," said the East African Union (car).
