Everyone knows the commission of constitution, 18th of 13, 2013.

The delegates of the commission on constitutional changes, under the chairperson of the commission, Judge Joseph Warioba and the Deputy Chairperson, Retired Chief Justice Augustino Ramadhani, has started sessions to conduct their opinion polls from various institutions, one citizen and many other groups, so that finally write a draft of the new constitution.

Those delegates are meeting to prepare a new constitution draft on time, with great shock, our country take long in many administrative trials, to be careful among the citizens or some of the leaders from different levels even the national level.

We have been confirmed about the existence of enough constitution of the current constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania, to an extent that some of our colleagues lost life in different events of violence, not only a lot of conflicts, the deaths have been heard due to sexual violence, between Christians and Muslims.

We have witnessed the recent violence in Businesspeople in Geita province, violence between Christians and Muslims use the death of several injured and their foundation is laziness of the government in dealing with symptoms of the problem.

We don't like looking at any other side in those violence because we believe that you are not supposed to stop the mockery that is not supposed to find any signs of violence without informing the interests of the country.

Peace of the country is the important guardian of all religious leaders and any religious leaders, it depends on the peace of the country, and this is clear, it is clear that because religion can continue to bring development in some of the countries in the world.

Therefore, we don't like looking at all our colleagues that cause violence or wanting to stop the mistakes that they agree with their colleagues through the interests of our country but also you can be patient and assume the rights of others according to legal laws of the country.
