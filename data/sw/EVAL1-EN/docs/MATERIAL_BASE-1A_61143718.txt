More than two hundred thousand farmers, who are in the contract to sell their cargo, the sugar sugar company in Kenya have announced the crisis with the company for what they are claiming to be the violence that is taking place against them.
Those farmers claim that the solar energy company has been using their payments while it will block the park, to sell elsewhere, a step that causes the difficulty of life.
I got a farmer to have a lot of fear and have to make sure that every farmer will be in another sector to grow, Deo Filikunjombe should not be so much with hunger in Kenya.
And if the government will not take a step.
You have the ability to buy.
And we are happy about the issues of a black company I don't know the drinks company has risen up!
And.
Men.
