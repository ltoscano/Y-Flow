The love of a phone has risen up, but I told her love.

I am a girl who is 24 years, live in Dubai. I have found a fianc√©e who is 37 years old and he was accepted back home and we are in the process of scoring Ndeki.

In fact, Mister she does not know so much to an extent, he is forced to send himself and ask him in every issue and also advised all the things about her life and in everything he would not wait for a period of five years so as to protect themselves with their studies.

For sure many years we do not have a habit of coming together or not seeing each other but I think it is just a phone for a period of two years.

He gets to you very much and for me, I wish you this one on how she does not love me and I would like to sit with him and I cannot sit on a day without talking to him and I cannot do something without talking to him.

But when you know me, you will go to us to meet, my song you put it and even if I have not seen this person!

I request that you to be able to understand that truth, I wish you about the mind, I am not able to give her a good chapter, and if it is not true, it's not easy to do if we will get married?

But in my heart, I don't know very much and I can't know what I don't know what I don't know what I don't know how to do my heart or my mind?

I am very happy that when I came out in my marriage and you will give him a joy she is expecting or do a problem that doesn't have a lot of each other because Moyoni.

I request for yourselves.
