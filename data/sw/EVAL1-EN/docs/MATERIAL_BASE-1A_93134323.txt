The County Council of Handeni district has started a procedure of collecting revenue itself instead of using agents.

That procedure will be supervised by the directors in collaboration with councilors and it is expected to give it to the council money instead of depending on the government's grant.
The executive director of the council, William Vangimembe Lukuvi has noted that while responding to a question at the council of councilors which took place recently in this town.
He said that is the implementation of the government's directive that is aiming to enable the council to implement its responsibilities as required, because a grant has not meet everything.
"The government has directed the council to prepare themselves in collecting revenue through our local sources, because there is no council that is driven by depending on money from the main government, therefore I believe that it is the responsibility of every executive director to cooperate with you in collecting revenue so as to have success," said Commander Mpinga.
However, the council has decided that you collect any revenue who will go against the instructions, including evading tax collection in the ward, legal action will be taken against them without caring for their positions.
The chairman of Handeni district council, Ramadhani Dimwa, contributing to that issue, he urged the councilors to supervise the collection of tax for different types in their wards.
The district commissioner of Handeni district, Godwin Mutahangarwa has thanked the council for that decision and insisted that its implementation will help to control the problem of lack of finances and he said the procedure of putting agents caused the council to cause many revenue.
