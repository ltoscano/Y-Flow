President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged the ministers that are involved with issues of East African Community to speed up the implementation of the system of passing products at the port and to reduce the cost of running business in this region.
President said that yesterday when he attended the occasion to launch the electronic systems while the launch was attended by the presidents of Paul Kagame (Rwanda) and Yoweri Museveni (Uganda) in one of the Safari Park Hall in Nairobi.
"Through the steps that were taken by the government last year, it will be approved on products at the port of Mombasa to take place seven days, while the procedure will take five days at the Jomo Kenyatta '(KIA)," said President Kenyatta.
"But through this system of passing the electronic products, we are expecting that to be approved on products at the port of Mombasa, taking a three-day tour to the members of the East African Community to speed up the process of the establishment of that system so that business can expand," said Mister Kenyatta.
The system was launched by the organization of Kenya Against Duncan, after emerging as a long procedure of passing products from outside the port of Mombasa which was said to affect the business activities in the country and neighboring countries like Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi.
