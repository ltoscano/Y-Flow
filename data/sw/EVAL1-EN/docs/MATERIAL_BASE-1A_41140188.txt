When you go to Tena. That spread a bus.

With Grace Ndeki.

The Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA) has said that the operation was done to arrest the Korofi la Shangani areas that were distributed to a large extent after many drivers obey the road laws.
That statement was issued in Dar es Salaam yesterday by the officer of charge, East region, Mister Fadhili Dononda.

He said that the operation has succeeded in a large extent as a result of the buses that were presented by the port to follow the rules and regulations of the road.

"The operation to arrest the Korofi la Shangani areas that began in November this year has succeeded in a great extent, due to many drivers not to have a fine," said Bwiru.

He also said that the operation is sustainable up to every driver so that he can obey the road laws and to stop the habit of giving them to control the fare that had been planned for them.

Mister.

However, he said that for now they are partnering with the road safety council in the operation at the University of Ubungo and inspect the buses that are very bad and the ones that increase the fare.

He said that the operation is done in all provinces and it will be sustainable to be able to remove all fake buses.
