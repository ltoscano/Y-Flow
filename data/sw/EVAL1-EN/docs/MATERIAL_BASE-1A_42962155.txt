The presidential scandal, January Makamba when he defeated Lowassa, this topic he exposed.

"The presidential position is the position of status and great honor, when you ask you are not supposed to do sports' games and this is the procedure for coordinating the people to protect people, to give them allowances that they should come and ask for vying for acting sports which is a great shame.
Every candidate has the ability to make people to ask him to contest, but the others are not doing soon because they are going to respect the opportunities that we ask and believe that it's not supposed to have a search for corruption and music.

It is a shame to use a problem with hunger of political people and it's a shame to collect the youth and the elders of people and to prepare for seats and tents and to give them a picture, then you want him to look for leadership positions as well as corruption.
Leaders who are followed by people do not want the nominated members and discuss and beating the photos that they agree.

The candidate that is going on and using a lot of money to show it is possible that he doesn't believe that if it is possible, you can't coordinate the groups and make sure the journalists come to witness those pictures and the whole press.

I believe my party will not have natural resources, we want a clean leadership that it does not fear God, we want leadership with integrity and new thoughts of moving forward, in Tanzania, we want leaders who will implement those problems.
However, Mzee Makamba, together with his age of 75 years, today with the money to place them can make groups to vie for presidency.

Let it reach a place in our country to see this sports as if we continue with this issues, we are making a nation that is run just like people who want to know that they are needed by people, good leadership and an expert is not known by acting.
January Makamba.
