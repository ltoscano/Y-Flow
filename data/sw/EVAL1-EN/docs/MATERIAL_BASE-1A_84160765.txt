Zitto Kabwe after the court gave victory against CHADEMA.

Kigoma North member of parliament, Zitto Kabwe, yesterday entered the main court to oppose being discussed at the parliamentary committee of parliament, a meeting that was to meet today.

This is his statement after the court gave victory.
"Yesterday we went to court for one point to ask for justice to find justice because it doesn't know or is the very high level in our country to be able to do justice immediately after the executive committee of my party do a decision of taking my position that I was given mistakes.

"I went to appeal at the main council of the party to be able to see if the main committee followed the procedures of the party to reach those decisions, although I believe it doesn't follow the party procedures but by bad, my party leaders have decided to continue with the executive committee.

"We have not answered my letter of intention to appeal and be able to get information and the trend of the sitting so that I am able to appeal in accordance with the party. I would go to court so that the court can make efforts to be heard and be discussed.

"I thank Judge John Pombe Magufuli, he has given a long time to prevent the party's executive committee to discuss until when they will be able to answer the argument that were given by my lawyer, Albert Msepwa.

"Today we are going back to court for the purpose of continuing and getting answers from the parliament, but the main committee has been stopped by the court to discuss any argument that is facing them, but also those restrictions in the case is going on.

"The important thing in this is the rights and me if someone who is all the right is my opportunity to defend my party and be able to be heard on this issue before the executive committee was called."
