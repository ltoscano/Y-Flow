One suspect has no faith with.
By Benedict Liwenga.
A suspect in the motorcycle riders who was arrested after falling on the stem cells waiting to be trusted by his fellow court has written a letter to the main court of Nawenzake thanking him from the previous day.
In his letter, the senior suspect, Hillary Clinton has claimed that he does not have faith again and in the time the senior judge Hungary, who claimed to be fed a knee injury in the case he is facing.
Moreover, the suspect added that since showing his intention of not wanting to be called on his case, the judge Nyato has been announcing the life and told him that he will get a great judgment.
The warning despite having a great need in his case, Jean Ping has claimed that the judge attacked two years without informing them, a matter that he said is not true because he was set up by the officer showing the heart of twenty thousand shillings.
A suspect managed to escape from his colleague, May 23 this year, under Monsigation, when they were waiting to witness the case of the theft that was facing him.
On August 21st this year, he was arrested by police officers in Chisholm, a group in Mkonga area where he was awarded other charges to relocate in court.
However, Judge Nyato has ignored the claims by the aerial balls and instead wanting him to feel her letter so as to ask for forgiveness from breaking the name.
