Imprisonment for 30 years by touching the student.

By John Okello, Musoma.

The chief executive officer of Mabogini village, Mister Coutts Solo (42), has been sentenced to 30 years in prison after the Musoma District Court in Mara Province will arrest him as an offense of removing the student of Muguma Secondary School (name withheld).
That judgment was issued by the Resident Judge in charge, Raziah Ramadhani, who said the defendant forced his marriage laws by electing him to do sex with a girl in the age.
Under the age of 18.

While giving that judgment, Judge Damiani claimed that the action of the defendant to do a sex with the girl is to be legal.
It is a shame for a government servant who had been given priority by citizens to supervise and implement the law, regulations and procedures of the country.

Previously the government running mate, Mister Jonas Kaijage, claimed that the defendant forced the offense on May 6th, 2009, at the Mabebani area.

He said the defendant defeated the girl that he will pay for school fees and to do sex against the law and protect the children.

The accused was taken to court for the first time in the month of December 2009, after both sides gave the evidence, the court decided to be known as an offense and asked his sentence, in prison.
