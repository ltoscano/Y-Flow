America fell into a relationship with
Uganda.

April 3, 2014.

The American government has warned that it is looking at afresh his relationship with Uganda after President Yoweri Museveni of that country signed an agreement with the law that endangers the law and the commissioner of United Nations on human rights, Navi PRocky. He has warned that the law will improve the suppression of human rights in Uganda to run their lives by following up while the police were unable to implement that law.
