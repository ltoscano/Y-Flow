Story and joy is the name of Chunya village.

The head teacher of Kibindu Primary School located in Namahema ward, Simanjaro District Hospital has been wanted due to the claims to chew a total of 500,000 shillings that were donated by the Deputy Minister of Education and Vocational Training to renovate the school buildings.

Speaking with speaking at a public meeting in that village, Bwambale who is also a member of parliament for Songwe region said that handed over a total of 5 million shillings to several schools of Songwe region and that school had set aside 2,008 shillings.

He said that even after releasing those funds, there is no place that took place at that school where citizens claimed that the teacher has given those funds.

After the misleading reports, Mister Rwegashora ordered that a donation to the teacher so as to give an explanation on how the money have been used but even so, it does not happen that Mister Rwegashora decided to prevent a search for those teachers to give an explanation of those teachers.

However, the teacher did not happen in that meeting and claimed that he had gone into that meeting and claimed that he had already bought a committee of five people to follow up on those allegations and giving a answer after two days.
