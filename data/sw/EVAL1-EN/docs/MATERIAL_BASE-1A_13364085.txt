Maybe the thousands failed to vote?
Maybe a total of 15 million who were seen to be forced to leave the Islamic militants of Boko Haram in the northern region of Nigeria waiting to vote if the law will not be changed, one of the elections said.
"There is a legal shortage that you need to be resolved at the time of the right time or else the people will go off for justice," said the officer.
The former leader of the European Union will battle against President Goodluck Jonathan during the elections of February 2015.
Mchaga of Boko Haram has affected more areas that are many opposition followers.
Last year, President Jonathan announced a dangerous state in the northern regions of Adamawili, Borno and will be on the way to deal with that object.
But Boko Haram has been posting his attacks since that time and has announced the constituencies that won the Islamic State.
