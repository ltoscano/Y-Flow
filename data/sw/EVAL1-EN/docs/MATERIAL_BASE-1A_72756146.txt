How can it be the only citizens that are affected by the cases of lack of security?
I urge you to come out and how the cases of lack of security continues here in the country even after the president set correct the safety of security.
We were looking at the areas of Mombasa and claimed that it is dangerous to the way it is an indication that the security has not been successful.
So, as security is in a non-governmental organization alone and its citizens are not seen in the killing of people in the government has caused feelings of people who come from one leader in government to talk about statements not to reach them.
If the government has strength why you don't know the Kenyans there before that brutal act or the government claiming that it is clear that there is dangerous to the security of this nation, in general it is clear that there are high risks of the terror attacks in the country.
Why do I urge you through a letter.
