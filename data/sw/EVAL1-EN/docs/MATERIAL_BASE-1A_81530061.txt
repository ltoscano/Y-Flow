The CHADEMA candidate, Aisha Bui, has been excluded from Mbeya Rural elections to appeal by one of the opposition candidates of the Citizens Party (CUF) and the Revolutionary Party (CCM).
About who they are supporting him in the Mbeya rural elections, Doctor Slaa said that they have already received our stand about it that we should never support any candidate in the race of Mbeya Village. "
This is due to the history of parties participating in the election there and especially the action of the day before yesterday where among those who succeeded to put the objection is the CUF. Until it started supporting someone there should be a certain process which now it's not in.
Therefore, we will not be silent for the issue of Mbeya Village, "concerning their strategies heading to the general elections of the year 2010, Doctor Slaa said CHADEMA has had a working plan and because they are doing preparations for the local government elections this year and the general elections this year.
