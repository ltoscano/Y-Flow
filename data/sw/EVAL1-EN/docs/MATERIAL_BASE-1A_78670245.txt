The squad of Nigeria was found in June.
The coach of Nigeria "Super Eagles," Stephen Kraehenbuehl (in the picture) expects to announce the names of 23 players who will participate in the World Cup finals this season, by June 2.
The information officer of the squad, Ben Almas has said that they don't have a quick way to announce who will go to Brazil and who will remain in the last day to announce the names given by the Federation of International Football Association (FIFA), on June 2, the officer said he believes that the coach will have a difficult time to choose the players to go and leave since now the camp has 30 stars who have shown a good level.
"Nigeria has been born with players with great talent that is why I think these players have a chance to arrive in Brazil," he said.
In another step, the players were given a joy after allowing a draw of 2-2 goals by Scotland on Wednesday this week.
Those players wanted to win so that they have the ability to do well in those finals.
