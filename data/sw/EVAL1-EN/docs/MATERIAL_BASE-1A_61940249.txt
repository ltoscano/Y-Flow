By Darassa.

The Ministry of Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development, together with various stakeholders, have discussed the draft of the new plan to improve the city of Dar es Salaam for 20 years to come in the city to be in a new view.
Speaking to the Majira newspaper in Dar es Salaam yesterday, the director of urban planning and villages in that ministry, Miss Albina Chimela, said that the plan will give direction to plan the areas due to its needs.

He said due to research that has been expected to take place, 25 percent of land are still being involved in that city with 75 percent not being used thus causing various challenges especially the construction of industries in the residential areas of people.

"75 percent of this area of this city is not in the plan of improving the year 1979, that situation has contributed to the presence of residential houses and their activities from the smallness of the area," he said.

He added that, because the city of Dar es Salaam is growing very fast, the plan will help to set aside part of residential areas, business, education and improving the areas of water and land conflicts.

"Last research conducted 2 percent of the area that roads is 15 percent, a situation that caused the existence of transport problems in Dar es Salaam," he said.

He said through that plan, they are expecting to get a big area so as to solve the road problem that is helping many residents to plan the economy areas like the airport areas and improve the port to ensure that it meets the needs of people.

Miss Zigamba said that the program will also discuss people's homes and areas they are working for their activities so as to eliminate the problem that is like entertainment centers.
