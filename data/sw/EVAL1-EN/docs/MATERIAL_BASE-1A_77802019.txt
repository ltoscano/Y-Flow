The match of Gor Mahia have been safe.
For the second time this season, the old club in AFC Leopards Soccer Team and Gor Mahia are meeting again in the premier league match of the TPL Board.
This stern match that is recognized by many fans as the body of the in-law usually do sexual excitement especially due to high competition between these teams with a broad way in that profession in the country.
Apart from competition between the players of both teams, we have also been witnessed between the fans of these teams and many times the match between these teams have been caught in terms of misconduct together with the destruction of public property and personal property.
According to the way the first match is going, we are expecting that all fans should make sure that it was in that match where AFC Leopards team emerged winner by 3-0 goals against their rivals Gor Mahia.
We believe that the company that deals with running the premier league in the country, is together with security agencies will be careful tomorrow so as to ensure that security is being maintained together and make sure that a stern warning will be maintained together to ensure that a stern legal action will destroy the law by bringing about flatulence.
However, a lot of wisdom, is to make sure that all those who are doing violence in breaking or destruction of the stadium being unable to enter the field.
There are the old people who are going into the field to look for the ball, but not to go to participate in the cases of lack of discipline which they have been removing the name of the national soccer on the eyes of the international nations.
This is as a result of the ignorance of fans who do not get pregnant, the fans that do not know the value and those who can say are those who were affected by the growth and development of the brain and evil deeds in the communities around them.
