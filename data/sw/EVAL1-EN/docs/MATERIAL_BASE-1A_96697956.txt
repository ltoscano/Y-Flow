This is not a word, "the man is a housing head," you give you an assurance.

There is one thing that doesn't have been done by various religious leaders, which also the believers do not be sent well when the man is the head of the house or family, this issue is not something to be a member of the house or family.

I know it, I am many men to be the head of house or family, it is an issue of need more than several years, a man found himself as the head of the family as a result of this issue, it did not change or be used.

But why are women who are the heads of family and those families are going on well, but also there are women who do their husbands and not otherwise, it is that when a man is the last spokesperson.

It's true that men need or don't meet but it's not only men alone, but all human beings are supposed to do, therefore many men have been using that opportunity to sell their wives and even children, "I am not seen, then," many times the expenditure are used.

There is need for men to know that, their family leaders did not want to know more quality of women and they are supposed to know that, not to be at the end of the family's end, because human being and couples are supposed to marry each other.
