Zitto Kabwe to attend the session of UKAWA during this time it is a big offence.

Yesterday at the CCM's parliamentary candidate, Zitto Kabwe stopped the parliament and talked to him that the meeting of UKAWA last night was to Zitto Kabwe as the chairman of the committee whose argument is being debated during the session of UKAWA which is going on well, especially during this time.

Zitto Kabwe, he would like to explain the surprise of the political parties because in passing the recommendations of his committee who need to support the members of parliament of all the parties including not less in UKAWA.

Zitto didn't be able to listen to a goalless draw in UKAWA this time when his committee has been given a great opportunity to ferry over the nation in this scandal, without favoring any position for personal interests to build politics, this is the way of bribery, which will enable Tanzania Private Sector Foundation.

However, he did not know that, he did not remember a lot and he arrived at the Quran not saying that Zitto has taken her part and he is using his position as the deputy chairperson, he would know that he is important for the life of the opposition in the country.

Zitto has succeeded to show that he is important in UKAWA, but he has also used his opportunity to vie for the chairperson of PAC, something that made him to parliament in making a decision to parties fanaticism instead of wisdom.
