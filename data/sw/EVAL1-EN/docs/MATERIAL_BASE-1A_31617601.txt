CHADEMA is facing issues.
October 30th, 2014.

The Party for Democracy and Development (CHADEMA) has still not brought the registrar of political parties for the party that brought together with the office of the controller and auditor general of the government (CAG) as the law is supposed to be known.

Recently, CHADEMA came out to journalists the report of the inspection that was done by the CAG which is not satisfactory, but on a report of the registrar, they were not able to take it as required by the law.

The report of the registrar of political parties that was presented yesterday at the Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC) that took place in Dar es Salaam has shown that it's only six political parties here in the country, that are all presented their reports.

The parties has been mentioned to fulfill those legal requirements are APT development, Revolutionary Party (CCM), National Examination for Change (NLD), Union for Democratic Change (ADC) and Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CUF) and the Citizens Party (CUF).

According to the law of political parties, all parties are required to submit the report of their inspection that was done by the CAG at the registrar's office so as to take place in place them in government newspaper.

However, the report of the office of the registrar has explained that CHADEMA and other parties that have been presented their accounts inspected, they are supposed to do so by October 31st this year.
