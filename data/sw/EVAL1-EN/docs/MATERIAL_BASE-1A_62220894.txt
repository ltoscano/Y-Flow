The Secretary General of the Revolutionary Party (CCM) in Mufindi district, Iringa province, David Yasin, has denied claims that he has three companies of harvesting forest that have been given permits for harvesting forest harvesters in that district.
While speaking to Good Citizen in this city at the end of last week, Yasin said that he was not following all legal procedures and were given 200 meters for harvesting forest without using any company.
I am given a permit for my name and not by using any other ways that are not legal and I have no experience with this activities and therefore I don't have a company even one of the news reports are saying, "he said.
Yasin said that the news of him is alleged to have given those permits by making sure they have praised all the procedures as usual and it is an entrepreneur known for those activities.
In recent days, they have emerged the reports of corruption and informing them in the provision of those permits in the forest market where some of the top leaders of the government and CCM have been facing.
