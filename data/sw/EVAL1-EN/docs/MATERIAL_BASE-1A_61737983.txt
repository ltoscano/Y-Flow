The government will work on the policies of supplying electricity to farmers by involving personal investors in the program.
That step will lead the government to get into the procedure of buying and spreading it, due to what it said is to get in a situation where it seems to be a personal businessman.
According to the chief adviser of the President Uhuru Kenyatta, about food to the country Mister James Nyoro, farmers will be buying those equipment from private companies.
In a letter to the Minister for Agriculture, Mister Felix Khajida Kopa, Mister Nyanga, has advised the ministry to continue with relocating the report to its officers of the lake region about those changes so that they can help the farmers to understand and how to benefit from.
"At the moment, the government is implementing its responsibilities of importation of criminal activities and then put it up until it was coming from next year, we want to resolve the partners in the private sector," he said.
He said that the implementation of that policies will be completed in the next year.
For now the government is spreading 100 tons of cancer.
