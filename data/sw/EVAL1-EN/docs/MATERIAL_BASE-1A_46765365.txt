Diana Edward, recently at the mother for another time, if it is called for six money they must be avoided.
Let me follow me, I will help him to increase the speed on education.
The technical bench.
First.
I will continue to thank God together but not in general.
I would like to talk about it is the technical profession all our youths when they went to learn or join technical education because the cost is high.
The first studies only did we have for there here among them.
It is one university for one institution and every one being capital, therefore, they have a great cost and we won to join because we the youth have no income to join because it's a very high cost now, then I request for the government.
In addition to different organizations that can help us to build many universities in the province of Mwenge to play in Nyamkazi Primary School, so as to fulfill our youth so that we can join and be reduced, we have ever made the studies of technical profession now then for all the ones they have found in their technical school.
For this period I request that you can help you and today I've heard the end of the chairman.
He knows it.
