After Wema reminded me of mobile phone and Huawei does not loose the market?

That is thinking that Wema is not good, Wema is everything by switching off the fees that are in Dar es Salaam after removing the phone that does not use Huawei and the many people now did not give them again.

I have my brothers who is a modern shop in Kariakoo, he was surprised by customers' words, especially the mother saying they will give any kind of phone but not when she didn't know!

I have believe that it's a big companies like Airtel to use because it has a extra thing.

Inside it should not have a business that is an order?

Wema will go to see you forever and!
