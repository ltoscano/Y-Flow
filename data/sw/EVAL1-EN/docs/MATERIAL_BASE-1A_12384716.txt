The silence of the president's saga is inspiring.

It is a surprising thing, an indication that when you go into this Saturday, JK has not said anything about the Escrow scandal that she recorded at Airport.

However, he told BBC that he did not know this issue despite parliamentary plans to prove that the money for Public SACCOS, Virgil Hoja, has not been shocked and told me (there's no statement from statehouse.

Although 321 billion has been identified by hooligans in its country, today the third day since the recommendations have been called but JK is silent, and asked for statehouse.

Even to give a press in the time of condemning that act, we have failed or has started a new investigation if I am not happy to address the first countries of the month.

For a president and with a problem with his country on Monday, we have already announced to capture the pregnant women that did this issue according to the parliamentary team, recently, it is still asking yourself what is this one, the country is Auto FGM?

Honorable president we did not understand that we won weeks.
