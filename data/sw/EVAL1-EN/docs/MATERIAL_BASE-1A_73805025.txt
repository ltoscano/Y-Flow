Citizens have been urged to be awarded that warning and counterfeit products conducted in the country and urged them to report to fruit juices.
While speaking in Nyansalwa Primary School in the country during the launch of that convoy which they visited different places in the Mount Kilimanjaro area to encourage citizens about dairy products, the Deputy Director of the National Housing Corporation, Miss Agnes Karumuna said that those products are not only a threat to the economy of the country and also in reproductive health.
Miss Karineli said 70 billion shillings were lost every year in Kenya and cut off the economy of the country.
"Statistics show that industries and legal business is losing 50 billion shillings every year, while the government has lost 19 billion shillings due to lack of paying tax that is caused by the selling of fake products," said Mrs Karineli.
He said the fake products are the ones conducted further despite that those products are supposed to involve fire accidents and destruction of at home.
Medicine, smoking, and even pens are some of the products that have been able to prevent them which are sold in plenty.
The director of fighting with fake products said the campaign they are doing which is called "Fedes fake" is intending to encourage the citizens about fake products and how to identify themselves and effects that come from its use.
