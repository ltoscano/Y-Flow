Tunduru District farmers wants the provision of licenses so as to be taken.
By Francis Dande.
The union of Pickup, (Para) yesterday urged the government to speed up the provision of production of that farming to personal farmers and said that the step will improve the sector.
According to that union, five foreign farmers have already sent a request to be given those licenses but it has taken a long time to be released.
Chairman of Para, Justus Monda, said the donation of those licenses will cause competition in the agricultural sector to strengthen that product.
"We know that the Minister for Agriculture, Felix Kona has shown an effort to revive this sector but because we have no control of two seasons to enable them to reduce time to be given licenses," said Monda.
