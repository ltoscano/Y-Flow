There is a big destruction of students in the creation of public servants, that is for buses to arrive in Dar es Salaam city again for the poor children even to the road safety and to know what a child is called a player, he knows there in one way to another, for example to the transport sector of the bus.
You find you in the bus you will be able to pay for a bus without getting into the vehicle, you find the driver, he sees this student is small or they know that there have been a lot of things you see the drivers and Makunga in my car.

Recent motorbikes have been done to the police.
They are looking for you, you find the student is expected to be under the age of age.

From Europe a student are attained nine years sitting behind the motorcycle that was because there I think of losing a student, the one can get married to me, he can leave each other from the wind of motorbike riders, you find the drivers of the motorcycle that were affected by those students.
All the three or four.
When you enter into the motorbikes because it is dangerous.
They can fight to play with your eyes on a very high level or small, therefore you can't get an accident on Sunday all Tanzanians can just be in other parts or even in the traffic issues you come from.
Tanzania is going on.
