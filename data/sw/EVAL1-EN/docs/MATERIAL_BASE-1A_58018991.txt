The fate of the shop?
By Luteni Selemani Semunyu.
The fate of ownership of most shops in the country will be known on July 17 after the High Court wanted the evidence to be done on that day.
Judge Aidan Bahama said that his children late Peter Kaguo has said their children can also be in court and explained how the wealth of the country is owned and displayed available.
Previously, New York Kaguo has said that in the allocation of those property, he requested the court to answer all the evidence since his name was removed from all inheritors of their father.
Saying their father was the former chairperson of the country, Mister Kaguo said his brother Simon Gola used that company using another name and therefore forced him to inherit the father of her father.
But Mister Grisham has apologized to the case saying he has enough evidence to show that he is personal property, and not the family's family.
Judge Emenalo about the brothers saying their behavior has dropped to Kenya the opportunity to attract investors from the conflict that made Massao from South Africa to withdraw.
Previously Massao had requested an opportunity to buy 51 percent of the country so as to enable them to expand the shops in East Africa.
But Mister Kaguta receiving the court and opposing that plan saying he had been thrown out of her brother.
