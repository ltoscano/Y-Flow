The draft of the constitution depends on our weakness.
Frode Dyrdal of 28, 2013.

Article 75 and 117 shows the new constitution draft, together with other things, it gives the reputation of vying for presidential positions through article 75 (1) it has set aside 40 years as one criterion for someone to be allowed to vie for the parliamentary seat in the United Republic of Tanzania.

The age of age as a criterion or reputation of being a leader has a lot of time in the political debate here in Tanzania, this issue was renovated and some of the politicians have been unable to have involved their views and their intention to vie for the presidency in the year 2015.
There are some of the politicians who want them to see those youths as leaders with giving up and who want big things to vie for the presidency, but I remember them in one point to encourage people who want to vie for the presidency on January Makamba when he got a chance to contribute to the presidency on January Makamba when he got a chance to contribute to the presidency on January Makamba when he got a chance to contribute to the presidency on January Makamba when he got a chance to contribute to the presidential candidate.

I have not read the views of Mzee Butiku for a more-inch width due to his position as a member of the Constitution commission which he refused to agree with his interest in order to enable the president.

One of the ways that have been emphasized in the third round of the draft is to oppose the age of discrimination, unfortunately, this year is under the age of 25 years since it is under the age of 18 years since it is expected to be accepted by any political party and that is facing a democratic system in its administration.
