Kenya think you to learn from us.
The death of President Michael Sata of Zambia being stolen from England has brought a new awareness in Africa.
Awareness which has shown the history since the year 1990, where the second president in Africa has been closed down in South Africa.
Even though the news of the death of Mister Nguji, was received there was worried about if Mister Guy Scott, former white, will be accepted to be the first president, finally citizens and politicians from Zambia have agreed.
Mister Scott is also a citizen of Zambia and was the vice president under Mister Rwegashora, but his origin is a white.
To be accepted, it has shown that people from Zambia are supposed to respect the constitution of their country and also the right to every citizen to have an opportunity to lead.
Considering that in the past, it's a percentage that it cannot go ten in that country, here Kenya is Scott, can be compared to someone from the community like self-doers and even Eliona.
To take the authority in the country with more than 100 percent, there is a sign of mature adults in politics of that nation, which Kenya is ending to be behind development and even democracy.
Here, Kenya, apart from good education and every kind of development, every day we promote politics and policies of discrimination on foundations of areas, tribe or even the throat cancer.
Our politics and our political parties have had a chapter of switching off when you will see for example the ODM Party is in Nyanza, Ford, Kenya is the western part of the Association and Wiwa is Uknga region.
If a person known as Mohammed Abdullah popularly known, people want to know that she is a child of who how many of them will not contribute to victory and so these these are politics that are outdated, Mwokozi, which has shown the history.
