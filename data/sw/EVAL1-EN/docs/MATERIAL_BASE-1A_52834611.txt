By Lawrence Mafuru.
The countries of the African continent have been advised to follow the example of Rwanda, as the criterion of following human rights.
Professor Pangamawe, said that many leaders in the African continent have been unable to connect their citizens together.
He gave an example of South Sudan, Congo and Central Africa, like countries that promote social war with an aim that will be able to distribute the citizens for their benefit.
A scholar gave those views at the Mount Meru College on Friday, Thika, when he was invited to address the students about different issues that are facing the whole African continent.
Professor Lumumba said that in the time the African Continent will be buried and the idea while waiting for everyone to be the eyes of the leaders, with the aim of going to the community.
In that event, Rwanda's ambassador in Kenya, Miss Youngsevier Msuya explained that it is tired of the way Rwanda has lifted itself from their evil deeds that they get to 20 years ago.
He mentioned the way the government used all the citizens, in the conference held in conjunction with the issues of the public and cooperate with them.
