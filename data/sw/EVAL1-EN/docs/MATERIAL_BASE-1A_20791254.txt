Rose Muhando is not my friend.

Bongo movie star, Rose Muhando has said that people should not be worried because of God's plans, he will get married to his fellow child Maliki Maliki.

"It is not a long time things will be good and we are continuing to play, I think we are doing well so that people should not be doubt, we will get married," he said.

Rose who recently praised the cleaning exercise and supported by various artists including the mayor of Ilala, Jerry Slaa, said people should not fear about that marriage because it is on the way.

"We are not tell you, maybe there is something that God has risen up, all the days quickly it does not learn," insisted Ndauka who has planned to vote in Tanzania so as to encourage citizens to consider the cleaning.
