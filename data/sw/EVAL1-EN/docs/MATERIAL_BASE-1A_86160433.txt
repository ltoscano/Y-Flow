A group of people are recorded because of doing the killings in Nzega District in Tabora Province to pay between 50,000 and 300,000 shillings, it has been noted.

This has been noted by the head of Nzega District, Godfrey Ngupula, during a meeting of a person that took place at the Anglican Church Grounds in that district that was done by the bishop of Tabora region, Mystica Mapunda Elias Maguri.
He said there are people who are believed to be involved with the killing of being paid for their employment, an act that is against the law of the country and disgusting to God.
He added that the fifth term government is keenly following up on acts of breach of peace and that's endangering the life of eternal peace, says that stern legal action will be released without caring for his position.
Moreover, he urged the servants of God to pray for the nation by giving the great importance of peace and love among the community so that the same time, the same time, the head of Tabora Province, Aggrey Mwanri, has urged religious leaders to prevent people involved in helping female children who are marrying them without following the law.
The directive was issued when he was addressing thousands of Muslims in Tabora province in celebrating the Eid holiday which took place at the Public Service College hall in that province.
Moreover, he congratulated the efforts of religious leaders of Islam of wanting to start a system of training on religious education countrywide by visiting every school to ensure ethics and fear of God is being among the community.
However, he urged the district heads, directors and heads of the department of education to take stern legal action against all those found through one way or another to weaken the education in that province.
