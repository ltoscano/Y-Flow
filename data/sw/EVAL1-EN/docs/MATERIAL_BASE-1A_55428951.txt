Thank you Ali Kiba for good?
Looking at Manufacturing Company, ask you to be known as a new song to the veteran rapper Professor Jay in his former song, Ndeki. That's why his work will understand more that event.
It's a very few people who remember to watch the headlines because they came from and asking for those who allowed them when they are and the veteran artist of Bongo Flavor music, AT is one of them and this is after talking to Bongo Flavor star, Ali Kiba.
AT is looking at the way he can be able to give him a message of thanks to Ali Kiba for a lot that he made as an artist and she did not want to write a long letter on an albino as they did not want to write a long letter on an unusual thing, because there is a foolish thing after scoring their photos.
"Kakingo said, it has been a panel of people not to remember a question and I request me to let me feel that, we thank you for much my work and I will see me if I was the guest of honor to the city and even when it was also the guest of parliament.
However, I've told me that I have left music, that decided to say you are ready to give your money in the pocket does not understand that I will succeed in a long letter where he spoke to a lot of things and several events that he helped with Ali Kiba.
If you put aside his conflict with Diamond, AlAli Kiba is the one who was surprised and loved by many not to live in Bongo, apart from East Africa in general, this is due to his personal behavior, working hard by most people and big artists.
