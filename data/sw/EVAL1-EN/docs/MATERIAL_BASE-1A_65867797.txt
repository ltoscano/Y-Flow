The driver, the child has been released on 1 million shillings.
The driver of the lorry that caused the death of nine months and injured four passengers at the Thika road was set free yesterday on a bond of 1 million shillings.
Mister Edom Mwansansu said, the letter denied the charges before the senior lawyer Method Kimomogoro made the court of the mountains in Nairobi.
Mister Toba was accused by causing the death of James Kabende or who was competing with her father Mister John Lukuwi.
The accident happened at the junction of Thika and Outsourcing Limited in the morning at a lorry that was caused by three points where four passengers were also injured.
That game ended up with nine charges of causing the death of that child and injured by four passengers for running the vehicle.
