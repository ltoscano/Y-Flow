The cabinet of President Kikwete will be divided on May 31, 2012.

After the committee headed by the Retired President Ali Hassan Mwinyi speaking to the members of parliament of the Revolutionary Party and the ones that were involved with conflicts, ignorance, and abusive language at the meeting, it has been noted that a division is only among the members of parliament but has already moved closer to the council of ministers and distributing those ministers.
The investigation of Raia Mwema, following a talks with some members of parliament and ministers, has revealed that a division in the ministers' council on a certain level will take a different chapters by the one of the members of parliament of CCM.
In the council of ministers, the situation is different from several days after the meeting of Mwinyi, Dodoma, there are ministers who started to select their ministers, but also some of the ministers who started moving to their ministers, a situation that is mentioned to have moved closer to the directors of the ministry and eventually distributing all executives.
But also in those talks of Raia Mwema, it has also been noted that there are some ministries with the ministers that see the view of one group in that division, a situation that is mentioned to be a tension like other senior officials in the ministry will have opposition parties.
In that division, its source is mentioned to be a scandal of Richmond Development, especially the involvement of the former prime minister Edward Lowassa in that scandal where ministers and ministers alleged to be close to them have continued to defend his skills and even to see their colleagues who are marrying them.
One of those ministers are Sophia Simba, who now is not only said it's impossible for some of his fellow ministers, but also CCM has started causing some of the accusations that he made to some people in his efforts to defend those suspects. Simba is alleged to say that a businessman Reginald Mengi, is not a member of the party.
More reports indicate that among the 26 ministers who are present is the prime minister, 10 have been claimed to have a similar position with some of the members of parliament of corruption they had been found, while four other ministers face in the defense group.
Ministers alleged to have the stand of fighting corruption including Richmond Development, John Magufuli, the Minister of Industry, Trade and Marketing, Doctor Mary Nagu, the Minister of Water and Irrigation, Professor Mark Mwandosya and the minister of the country, the Office of the Prime Minister of Parliament, Philip Mpango.
Others are the minister of health, Professor David Mwakyusa who is reported to have the top position under the minister of regional administration and local governments, CKraehenbuehl, the East African Minister's Minister, Dietric Mkenyi and the minister of community development, Miss Margareth Sitta.
Ministers who are alleged to be their stand did not exercised in scandal of Richmond Development, Minister for Security and Defense, Doctor Hussein Mwinyi, the minister of infrastructure, Doctor Shukuru Kawambwa, minister of law and law Mathias Chikawe and the Minister for Agriculture, Stephen Wasira.

However, it was said that the group of ministers with great stand who want to be taken against those suspects, many of them have had a good record working compared to the defending champions of the suspects.
Some of the members of parliament who talked with his fellow citizens have claimed that four other ministers have failed to be revealed directly from the existence of every group.
In the last meeting of parliament, the implementation of a safe journey in the Maziku of the Parliament about Richmond Development was supposed to be released by the government but it was not that, without the open reasons.
The long time investigation of Good Citizen in parliament has also revealed that the effects of groups on a certain level have seen the Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda, who was appointed by President after Lowassa's resignation.
The investigation has revealed that during the 16th meeting of parliament and some of the sessions of the 17 meeting which had already started, when he was giving a motion or answer questions there and the defense of the government is part of few ministers who have been congratulating him by campaigning for him and others were in their talks.
As a result of that situation, one of the members of parliament has claimed that there are ministers not to give him a chance of honor and put the necessary efforts to the prime minister, Pinda and that they have continued to have great efforts in their group than to the prime minister.
The ministry that have reduced to be a minister of defense, for Lowassa and other suspects are the ministry of state, the office of the president and good governance led by Sophia Simba.
Other ministries which have been revealed to have ministers in groups of groups are together with the Ministry of Labor, Employment and Youth Development, led by Professor Juma Kapuya, and his Deputy, Doctor Makongoro Mahanga.
Kapuya was mentioned by one group in that division that it is one of the people that are supposed to be taken against Lowassa for the cost of other politicians including the speaker of parliament, Samuel Sitta and his assistant, Makongoro Nyerere who also entered with Lowassa during the meeting.
Some of the members of parliament are also looking at the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the country that is being led by leaders with groups of groups, although it was alleged that the deputy minister Khamis Mkotya, has failed in a long time to resolve his differences with his minister, Lawurence Museru who is alleged to be the group of Lowassa.
In another step, some of the members of parliament who spoke to Good Citizen from all groups have condemned the expectations that arise but just after the completion of the meeting between them and the Committee of Mwinyi.
While one side continue to insisted that the suspects who were involved in the ruling party seems to be released, their colleagues have had a different stand.
However, the group of members of parliament who want their colleagues have been directed to have more strength even before the citizens and different institutions including higher education in the country as it has been written by some of the newspapers in the country.
On the other side, the condition of the presence of what is explained as a tension may not be a result of those symptoms occur and continuing to resolve the conflict between the speaker of parliament, Samuel Sitta and some of the politicians of that group, Samuel Sitta and some of the politicians in that group.

It is said that Kingunge Ngombale Mwiru came back to his stand during the meeting of Mwinyi but showing responsibility for that position, the speaker of parliament while speaking in parliament for a short time before the national assembly was evident that his parliament has still teeth.
Sitta answered, "this is a parliament with teeth" while explaining the decision to consider the members of parliament to go to the Loliondo area where the conflict between the citizens and the investor, the conflict between the government through the Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism, ackson Shamenda, presented his report from the committee through the minister of natural resources and tourism, ackson Shamenda, presented his report from the committee through the minister of natural resources and tourism, Shamhuna, Mhagama, presented his report from the committee through the minister of natural resources and tourism, ackson Shamenda, presented his report from the committee through the minister of natural resources and tourism, Shamhuna, Mhagama, presented his report from the committee through the minister of natural resources and tourism, ackson Shamenda, presented his report from the committee through the minister of natural resources and tourism, Shamhuna, Mhagama, presented his report from the committee through the minister of natural resources and tourism, ackson Shamenda, presented his report from the committee through the minister of natural resources and tourism, Shamhuna, Mhagama, presented his report from the committee through the minister of natural resources and tourism, ackson Shamenda, presented his report from the committee through the minister of natural resources and tourism, Shamhuna, Mhagama, presented his report from the committee through the minister of natural resources and tourism, ackson Shamenda, presented his report from the committee through
That report of Mwangi have been accepted by the parliament after the prime minister explained that there was no human rights while citizens were affected when their rights were misled, being together with their residence and Karimjee in other places including acts of embarrassing women.
Previously, before the speaker entered Parliament in parliament, was being led by the chairperson, Job Ndugai, who is a member of parliament for Simanjiro constituency, Christopher Ole Sendeka to stop and explained the parliament that in a big part of Prime Minister Mwangi, who is false and therefore asked the speaker for the speaker for giving a decision that will help the interests of the citizens.
As a result of that decision, Ndugai said that he will give that issue to the speaker who attended the decision and when it arrived at the evening a day before yesterday, the speaker gave out the stand that he would leave the team of parliamentarians at Loliondo Town, a step that without doubt in the government without caring about the interests of the citizens or not.
The report of Hassan Mwinyi's report is expected to be presented at the general meeting of NEC-CCM without doubt after going through the hands of President Jakaya Kikwete, who is the chairman of that party.
For a long time, there have been a call of wanting the secretary general of CCM, Yusuf Makamba who came back to that position as a result of various accusations including going to groups of the CCM party, Nape Nnauye, who came out in public and claimed that the construction contract at the CCM's youth union (UVCCM) arrived in Dar es Salaam city is of theft and warned that community.
In those accusations, Nape wanted some of the leaders of the Executive Council of UVCCM, including Edward Lowassa who was the former prime minister and resignation of Proin Promotion Company, Doctor Emmanuel Nchimbi.
However, that issue was taken to NEC-CCM and the decision was brought to the creation of committee to investigate and as required to implement that agreement, the committee made great changes in some of the leaders who did not want to be in his group inside CCM.
