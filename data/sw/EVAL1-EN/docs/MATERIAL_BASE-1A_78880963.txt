The agricultural sector is the sector that causes many people here in Tanzania, and it involves more than 80 percent of them, it means that there is a very few countries like agriculture, therefore, there is a very few countries like agriculture, therefore, there is a very few countries like agriculture, therefore, it is like a very long time.

By bad luck, it's not just that town where many people see agriculture is like a certain way, I remember that there is a long time when I went to study agriculture, at the University of Sokoine (SUA) in Morogoro, some of the brothers have lost their views, but when I believe there is one day, you will sell their views to them and me that I will be the catalyst to the changes in the thoughts.
Other issues that are building here is that we have been the source of doing badly in our farming because we have forgotten that farming is business and production which we have reduced, therefore there are many companies that produce technology in farming because we have discovered that agriculture is better and production so as to ensure medicine is growing and quality.
But the question of asking, they started where until when they arrived there?
This topic, political steps to increase production that are not so as to reach Achievement.
We learn from this is that we will not need billions of money to reach, when we reached our colleagues, so we don't know that every year we are expecting to change, but we don't think that we can invest in minerals and other big businesses, but if we saw it, where we can invest in minerals and other big businesses, but when we saw it.
Conclusion, I say only I would like to recognize the efforts of people who have begun to wake up and they've already allowed us to do everything in agriculture. I request many Tanzanians to meet your views in agriculture.
