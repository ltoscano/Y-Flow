We thank the TBS by releasing those involved in Melbourne City.

Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) has announced a ban on the ban of Melisa John, from being involved in the country through a clean way while having no standards of standards.
Already the cargo of those bricks had been denied the port after it was revealed that they did not meet their standards while the procedures of taking place were taken from India.

While those procedures are being presented to the officers of the organization, they discovered that there will be an eye of the type shop, thus they were forced to go back to the port being satisfied with its officers, that was found in the port, a situation that made that organization through the acting director, Mister Leberata Mulamula wants the citizens to stop using those phones since it is not safe.

According to the technical information officer of TBS, the ones that were put up with water takes place and put into climate change before reaching the required levels, a situation that shows that they were used for problems, a situation that helps them get married and get married.

For this, we have every reason to congratulate the TBS officers so as to identify the existence of those accusations that were put in the country before the procedure of inspecting products especially the AIDS virus (HIV) and it is not true that we are required to protect themselves from TBS because they are required to be the security guards.

On that basis, we request for the citizens and the business people in general to make sure that the people are distributed to the market at this time when efforts are taking place so as to identify the actor that will involve those bricks so that they can be taken against them.

We believe that time has come now for now, we will enable them to avoid the meaning of support new products while we do not have sure if they will not meet the quality of products which have already been discovered that its quality and experts of TBS have already been discovered that its quality and experts of TBS have already been put in the country again through a reduction.

In this, we have seen the importance of the presence of laboratories in the villages and the professionals who have helped to identify those companies and give information that will help reduce the effects of Tanzania without fake products and it is possible for all stakeholders to cooperate to follow it since its effects are big.
