Politicians are using tribalism as a weapon to fight for the leadership of Kenya Otieno Kinoo-Nairobi, many times, ethal has been taken as a bad thing, someone is involved with them.
Frequently we are given a message from the various sectors that we shouldn't have been abila.
I would have to be fired why to be proud of the diversity of the mila of our different tribe should not be wise instead of being the issue of dividing as Kenyans.
Politicians especially have assume this issue of tribalism as a weapon of competing for political leadership by kutupumbaof that they are defending "tribe" their or our.
Kenya, and the whole world, there are only two types of tribe.
The rich and the poor.
Their problems like the whole world regardless of the issue of skin color or tribe.
Therefore, if Kenyans are suitable for us three times before they agreed to be separated from the principle of ndimi that we are talking to our different mila.
We will celebrate our tribe and its different differences then we will be able to respect our colleagues.
The youth should not kill the war with perception, but they will be engamane for caring about their destiny in the near future.
