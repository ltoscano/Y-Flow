Ponography is the source of the collapse of the values many people have been watching the sex pictures without knowing that they are affected psychologically.
Apart from young people who have been supporting those photos including a young age, there are adults who have been abducted by those pictures.
I think that this shame has contributed to a certain level that they are in and evil that have been akishuhudiwa in the community and even conflicts in marriage.
Because it has been easy to get these photos from the development of technology, there is a need for people to prevent checking because can disrupt the life of a person.
If action will not be taken then humans will be the same as an animal who cannot not differentiate good and bad.
