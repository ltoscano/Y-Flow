The education officer in Shinyanga province, Mohamed Kahundi, has advised parents to educate their children and not kuwakatting their studies to marry them so that they can get livestock, because they are denying the right to get an education and build poverty.

Kahundi said on the current world education is everything in building a child life, so it is good for parents in Shinyanga province to change their attitude and focus on investing education for their children who will come to help them in life later.
"If you omesha the child is the same as saving your own future when you will be hit and rented the strength to work, because he is the one who will come to turned out to be your guardian and he will bring them well with the education," he said.
Furthermore, he added that it is good now parents in humu, they left to appreciate livestock than a person's personality, but they should go education and educate their children so that later they come to those fruits of education and to have a better life and eradicate poverty.
Chairman of the board of that school, Peter Kuguru, urged parents to build a culture to follow up on the development of their children in school and to enable them all needs, so as to avoid sexual temptations that have been denied their dreams.
The principal of that school, Mwita Warioba said that students who graduated from the form four students are 144, girls with 84 boys.
