Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA) and the road safety squad in the special region of Dar es Salaam have been urged not to turn an eye on the drivers who are denied ruti and therefore causing disturbance to passengers.

In addition, passengers have been urged to be the stars and give information when they see drivers and makonda when they do, because it is against the law and procedures.
The statement was made by Temeke District Commissioner Felix Lyaniva while speaking to this newspaper at the peak of the commemoration of the week safely on the road safety of the special region of Dar es Salaam that took place at the Mwembeyanga grounds.
Lyaniva said some of the drivers and conductors of them have had a habit of giving out and not getting the end of the car as their licenses they were given by Sumatra are directed.
"This is a big problem, passengers have been getting a lot of trouble.
The example this problem is so much in the Kilwa road, you found a car written Temeke-Tuangoma but it ends in Mbagala, this is unacceptable, "said Lyaniva.
