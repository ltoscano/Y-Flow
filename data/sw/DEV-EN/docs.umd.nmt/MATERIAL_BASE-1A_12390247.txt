Zanzibar party members of Zanzibar (ZFA), the nation has said it will send the patriotic teachers to teach their national teams of Zanzibar.
That statement was given the day before yesterday by the president of that party, ravia Idarous during the occasion to hand over the license certificates B to 26 coaches who finished the training last month.
He said that the national teams will be taught by the people of Zanzibar themselves, who have the licenses of the African Football Federation (CAF) who were present.
"We have many teachers who are qualified to be able to teach our teams, so we cannot and we don't see the need to use the teachers from outside to come to coaching our teams," he said.
However, he urged those teachers to be ready to work their licenses, which they have acquired in order to reach those who were intended.
"Working well and get a certificate is one, but the second is to release that profession that you have got and to the targeted intended," he said.
In addition, he said that they have many teachers with a license B Zanzibar is not a bit and others already have a license A because that made work as required.
He said according to the regulation that they have put, any teacher who will not follow the rules in place they will be not in addition to him.
