The Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar (SMZ) has set aside the Saateni area that is in the area of Unguja town for the purpose of being used by small business people where all the important infrastructure is complete.

That was said by the Minister of State, Office of the President, Regional Administration and Local Government, Haji Omar Kheir when he was answering a question of the representative of the region of Mwera, Mihayo Juma Nhunga wanted to know why small businessmen are oppressed in doing their work in Darajani areas.
Responding to that question, Kheir said there is no abuse of any kind done by the government to business people so far, except the problem is there for some of those business people fail to follow the procedures and regulations.
He said that the government has built the Saateni area for the small business people to do their work well and transferred Darajani and Mwanakwerekwe.
However, he said that there are traders who benefit the order and continue doing those businesses in those areas which in the city's map have been set aside for building modern business buildings.
"The Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar is emphasizing that there is no kind of oppression being done by small business people in Zanzibar, we have not ended Darajani and Mwanakwerekwe and we have allocated the area in Saateni," he said.
He said Darajani area is currently in the map of enhance business including construction of modern shops.
