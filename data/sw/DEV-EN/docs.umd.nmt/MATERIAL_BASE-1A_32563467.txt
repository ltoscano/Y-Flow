The referees of the First Level League have been known, an editor there have been hustle of scored the referees who officiated the premier league matches.
The truth is that there is every reason to follow up even the matches of the lower level that there are things are happening you cannot harm.
I think there is every reason to start following these referees.
The first level league is that gives the premier league teams, its results teams are crowded with bad camps and come up while they are not jamvi of visitors, this problem of the referees to be left in the only Premier League, even the league bridges.
I believe TFF and the supervisors of the league will be careful for this I am saying and bring changes in the chezeshaji.
