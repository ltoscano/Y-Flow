Ummy Mwalimu and advice to the men in Dodoma.
Enyi men I didn't make a good advice from the minister of health, community development, gender, elderly and children, Ummy Mwalimu.
If you are being heard, Ummy is that he has not banned men to walk or have a romantic relationship with women.
Okay, let me sell what happened when in parliament and especially statements from the kinywani to this leader about love.
It is right, "men do not have a female children who are studying and instead if you need those things I go on in the streets women are there."
I don't know if the local women will agree with this mother's statement, because it is like he is interested in the wild dogs with hunger.
But on the second part some of the women can see a happy thing for them, because the students have now been beaten. "
What are the streets?
How are they found it?
And they will be the identity in which time?
Those were not my thoughts, he is there for me to let you know how to take care of us to ask him to deliver the answers.
