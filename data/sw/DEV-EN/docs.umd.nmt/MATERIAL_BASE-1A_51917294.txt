The SMS of love was giving a desire from her since when I got to you, I was a aunt.
I am 38 years old and I have oa.
The day before yesterday I got the SMS of love on my wife's phone and since that day my romantic feelings for him have been terrifying.
What should I do?
Through SMS will depend on who is the former who wrote the message.
If it's him then there are words.
If it is a man, you do not put a mistake your wife because it is normal for women to be led and perhaps even does not have a function with him.
Speaking with him about the message so you should know the action to take.
The medicine has been sacked, the aunt I was timamu in things up to my friend, ponidanganya may take medicine.
Since that time I have been helpless I can't do anything.
Now the mother children is while I have a plan along.
What should I do in order to come back to my previous situation?
Through SMS is wrong to use any drugs without the instructions of the doctor.
My advice is that the doctor's one that you tell me the same thing as he will help.
