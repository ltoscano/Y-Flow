The Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA) has said that now the doors is open to a bigger ship to dock at the port of Dar es Salaam, because the technology of modern ships allows them.

Apart from the technology that was used to make the ship, the authority has improved its coaches skills after taking them in South African countries, Denmark and France to get training on how to bring in the same type ships at the port.
The executive director of that authority, Deusdedit Kakoko said that after the coaches of the authority managed to bring in a bigger ship in the history of Dar es Salaam port with a length of 261 meters.
That ship called MV Hammonia Grenada which has the ability to carry out 4,256 shillings has been forced to dock at the port of Dar es Salaam and lowering 483 and kupakia 656 before heading to Thailand.
Kakoko said the port of Dar es Salaam has the ability to serve the ship with that size in its four dock, which is the dock number eight, nine, 10 and 11 which have a length of 11 meters.
He said that the arrival of the ship is enough evidence that the port has the ability to receive a big ship of that kind, which previously were taking the port of Mombasa only.
Previously, TPA was not ever involved in another big boat with 250 meters and later it brought another ship with a length of 255 meters.
According to the Captain kunatokana amno, the ships with 261 meters, most of the time threatens the port of Mombasa due to the UDOGO of the entrance but the arrival of this ship has officially opened the commercial doors.
