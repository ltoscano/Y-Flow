My husband has not been betrayed by the aunt?
I have been married and we have two children.
This time I have the pregnancy of the third child.
My husband ponioa I gave him and the child born with another woman and I agreed to bring him up.
Surprising thing is that the day before yesterday, I paid him and another woman and I have chafing the soul I want to leave.
I ask for your advice.
Through SMS state as that is always difficult to decide.
You and your husband have already been having two children and is expected to be a third child.
When you stop you will be able to raise those children without their father?
If he just explained it and that is not his behavior, try to speak to him as he looks about his act.
Asking for forgiveness and guarantee that we will not return to forgive him in order to maintain your marriage.
I'm wise to find all the methods to resolve the problems before thinking of breaking married.
