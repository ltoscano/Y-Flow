Speaking on the phone yesterday, the coach whose player Felix Simbu, has finished the fifth of Rio said yesterday on the phone that he did not expect to vie for since he had already led in a great position of RT.
"I don't plan to contest for it since I already participated in the top position of the leadership of athletics here in the country, so I will ask for a position when the presidency is the highest position, I will make the price," said Francis.
He wanted the president who will be chosen in that election to give them responsibilities to his members of the executive committee if he wants to work well and to promote the game here in the country.
He said many delegates of the executive committee of RT after being elected they are not involved in the activities of the game and just stay in the president and only the secretary of them wakijiput on the edge.
