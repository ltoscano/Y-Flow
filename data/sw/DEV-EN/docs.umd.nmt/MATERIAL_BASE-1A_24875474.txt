The Indians and the bicycle culture, we are rushing for private vehicles when we are competing to go to work with the vehicles of bad prices, our colleagues are coming at work and bicycle.
Here is Ede, Holland.
The bicycle is the popular transport.
This thing is not normal.
Imagine, the first year student of the University do not know his professor, a bicycle to go to college.
Certainly it is something you are able to be delivered in Dar es Salaam.

In this environment where everyone is secret development by looking at things, and in the environment that everyone is ready to be seen and he is even if ikibidi on loan, almuradi aendeshe a car, it is hard to get a solution to 'permanent problem of the queue in Dar es Salaam city.
Everyone thinks to solve this problem by increasing the vehicle on the road.

Just thinks if people would decide to use public transport, this one that is there, vehicles that will leave the road?
Other hours, it is funny.
40 vehicles that are struggling with the release of Ubungo can be carrying passengers between 40-42!
Every car, one person!
All that if you decide to climb a bicycle or use public transport, the queue will continue to be right?

The other problems are just a view.
Development is more than owning a car.
I have learned.

It has been written by it.
