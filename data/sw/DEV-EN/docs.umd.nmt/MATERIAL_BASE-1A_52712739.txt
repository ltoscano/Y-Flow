The TV stations of Kenya and Uganda have privileged Sana to Lowassa, Kwanini?

I have always been through briefly reports of the news of the TV stations of Kenya and Uganda.

Stations like WBS, NTV, Citizen TV, K24, KTN etc.
Cannot pass two days in their international news report without showing Lowassa and his campaigns.

A question.

1 - the one.
Why do they stand up with the one of Magufuli and his CCM?

2.
Those pictures of the video take over that they will be or waandishi wa habari they are field in the convoy of the president Lowassa?

3.
What is the goal especially to give him a privileged to endorse one and not all?

4.
It means that Magufuli has no international respect even here A / east?

5.
Although my wife (son CCM) has always told me that Kenya and Uganda will not come to vote, those are just entertaining.
Is it the right concept?
