The grounds of CCM, the infrastructure of the best infrastructure editor several weeks ago I heard the minister of information, Nape Nnauye saying the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) has a responsibility to sit with stakeholders including the owners of plots, to look at the procedure of setting up modern equipment on the fields that are used to the premier league games so that it should be easier to serve the players when they have encountered problems in the field.
Nape gave that advice in Mwanza town, during the preparation of a special game that was organized for making a family of a player Ismail Halfan liyepoteza life for a heart attack at the end of last year.
The editor, the advice of the minister Nape is good but it is good that he would direct the Revolutionary Party that is the owners of many fields used in the Premier League.
CCM is the owners of the grounds as CCM Kirumba, Sokoine, Majimaji, Nangwanda Sijaona, Jamhuri Morogoro and Dodoma and Samora.
Being the owner of the grounds, CCM has a duty to set up the necessary health care for the players.
Mwanzagi Chunya, Msambweni.
