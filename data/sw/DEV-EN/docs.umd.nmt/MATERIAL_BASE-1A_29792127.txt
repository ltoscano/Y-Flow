The government previons against murder going on the editor we are used to our country to be a peaceful island.
We live a pass and worry or fear about our lives.
But now, it is not so, we live like people that do not have confidence of tomorrow due to the murder going on in the country.
Dear editor this is going on now in the country it's not a normal killing.
Actually, has reached a point of a Tanzanian to assess his fellow Tanzanian as an animal without mercy?
Where our country is going to be?
Even if someone has been wrong there are the relevant authorities to make him, but it's not a person to assume the law in hand and to make the brutality like that.
We request the state agencies and the relevant authorities to take quick warnings.
This seeds that are planted now will come to be a big bomb later in our community.
God bless Tanzania.
The Mzalendo of truth.
