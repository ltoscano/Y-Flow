The government of Dar es Salaam Province has decided to educate form four students who will perform well in science studies and elected to continue with form five and six.

For now, grade four students are continuing to make their examinations to finish education at that level.
The Provincial Commissioner, Paul Makonda (pictured) explained about that decision when receiving a donation of 200 desks worth 20 million shillings from Almuntazir in that town.
He said his office has seen it good to start by educating those students in order to increase the number of science experts in various sectors in the country.
He said that the teachers who teach those students will be given cash to two million shillings each and to be taken to tourists in the animals and wife or the husband of the concerned teacher.
Speaking about the conflict of some of the parents of that school, Makonda urged them to use the procedures of taking the complaints required by starting from the district education officers and province and not to go directly to the ministry.
Also, he advised ministers not to work the complaints that are taken directly to them.
Chairman of the board of the Kargument Shia Ithand Asheri Jamaa (KSIJ), Imtiaz Lalji, which owns those schools said they are congratulate President John Magufuli for his efforts to promote the education sector in the country.
"It was a great shame for the country with big forest to transport the magogo out of the country while the children should grow into the dust afu in the search of education," he said.
