After Tanzania conceded 7 without Algeria, Shaffih Dauda Ahide badly TFF, claimed they are doing efforts of lies in Tanzania.

From the Desk Of Shaffih Dauda: One of the major problems of us Tanzanians are not accepting when there is someone he has continues.
Most of the time we are usually adharor the one that has what is, an example person has a good gali they will say that the one being led or kaiba.
We don't accept the reality or the success of the person in order to give me a challenge at least as I did not achieve or if I had been successful in the success of the one who went ahead.

I mean that the efforts of uhongo that were done by TFF to prove to Tanzanians that we can score Algeria something that is very false.
That is why I am from the beginning I was opposed to more than 100 percent about the issue of scoring against Algeria.
That is why since the beginning I made a promise that if Algeria was given by Tanzania then I will go to prison, I would like to change that is why I was sure that the issue would not have been possible.

The ball you don't have a short cut is the plans that there is clear, TFF played with psychology of people after they failed their basic job to manage the investment of soccer.
They are blessed with Algeria, they formed a committee that was a way to refees and to prove to Tanzanians that it is possible easily beating Algeria.

I did not deny this results but on the other hand I am happy.
This should be a lesson for leaders who have thoughts of a supporter instead of managing and creating a consistent foundation of developing our soccer, they are left to develop propaganda to satisfy Tanzanians.
