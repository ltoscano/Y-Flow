Dharam Singh Hanspaul which makes the board of tourism vehicles in the city, has set aside millions of money for various development activities of the residents of that city and its neighborhoods.

It is said that that is one of the ways to support the efforts of the fifth phase government of caring for the citizens of the lower state.
Speaking at the launch of the bridge to connect with Moshono County and Engutoto in Arusha, that was built by the company at the cost of more than 67 million shillings, the owner of the company, Hans Paul said his company is in hand with the government in Arusha province for caring for the citizens of the lower state.
Paul said the bridge is a savior and support to many citizens who were getting a huge trouble to cross especially during the rain due to lack of a reliable ferry and that was previously revealing the high risk of the children, the elderly, motorcycle riders, committed to all the legs and more there is no vehicle that had been able to pass there.
He said that apart from building the bridge, also the company has built three classrooms in Engutoto Ward for the cost of more than 50 million shillings, being one of the ways of wanting students while they are learning in class and staying in desks.
The owner said together with building and providing donations, also the company has employed more than 500 employees in three different companies that he owns, being one of the ways to solve the employment problem in Arusha province and here in the country as a whole.
