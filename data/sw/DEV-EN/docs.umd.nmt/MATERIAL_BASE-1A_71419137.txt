The Toto Africans soccer team in the city yesterday was unable to use it well at his home stadium in CCM Kirumba after losing 1-0 and Ndanda.

Ndanda got that goal in the ninth minute scored by Omary Mponda after playing the Ramadhan Malima of Toto and they will fill in the net.
Malima has been a bad luck since yesterday he played his first match of his team and caused a team wrapped.
That is the second match Toto is losing home, the other is against Mbeya City that was played last week.
After that match, the fans of Toto walimvamia their coach Rogassian Kaijage, accusing him to destroy their team thus they want to return.
However, the police stopped those violence and the fans of that team started singing "the best Tegete (John-coach of the former Toto) than Kaijage."
Speaking to this newspaper after that match, Coach Kaijage said he is preparing to resign any time.
"I don't have to say but I am prepared to resign any time from now on."
