The trash will advise you in Dodoma.
These members of parliament seem to like they don't plan to discuss what is going on to the mjengoni, but they have their different issues.
It's just my thoughts.
Since a lot of time they seem to talk about things relating to the election and how to make a campaign and win.
Let me come even if he is a professor of those things.... Maana their style for whatever is the campaign and their luck deputy speaker has not discovered that they are doing a campaign when they see them, he must not be living with them.
It is Hawa Ghasia, Peter Serukamba and Stephen Ngonyani (Maji Marefu), because the day before yesterday sat down a very long time at the corner of the building I think they had planned on how to start attacks.
All members of parliament are asking for the position of the delegation of the Executive Council of the Revolutionary Party (CCM) through a group of 10 members of parliament.
However, apart from being seen as they connect the power of wanting to take the campaign, their colleague, Livingston Lusinde seems to have an amazing speed in his campaigns that he does not have his own.
