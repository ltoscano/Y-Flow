Acts of theft, robbery have grown up in Mbagala Abdul Fumba, Mbagala car, Noah Noah led to a special vehicle after kugonga houses in Tabata Dampo area Dar es Salaam the day before yesterday, due to the vifusi that poured on the road without being distributed.
Picture by Salim Shao editor, Natoa this plea to the police force to take action quickly because we residents of Mbagala, Temeke District now has been normal to hear the bullets are complaining.
Although it is hard to know that they are happening those events, but we have witnessed several people being attacked, stolen from being injured by being shot.
I feel there is a shipment of weapons that are owned by people or groups and used in these events.
An example two weeks ago people who were not known were heard they were throwing shot seven times.
It is heading to these people from Chamazi and shots showed that they were walking on the road and in threatening people every time they were fighting in the air, maybe so that they should not follow them or not to come out in the areas they go.
I think that if the police will do a search in collaboration with a citizen they can't have seized those weapons because these people do not live in heaven but it is not here in the world.
