Luoga has urged all stakeholders to participate in ending the problem of mutilation in that district.

Every stakeholder fulfilling his responsibility, we will end the problem of GM Tarime, "said Luoga in that meeting which was attended by religious leaders, traditional elders and government officers who are responsible for the issues of the protection of the child.
He has said that he has ordered the police force to be in the state of caution in preventing acts of genital mutilation and urged the citizens to give enough cooperation.
"After getting information that the schedule is coming out, we have done a session and we have collaborated with the traditional elders, but I have also instructed OCD to make sure that we are blocking the female children to be addressed," said Luoga.
The Executive Director of CDF, Koshuma Mtengeti used the opportunity to introduce a new project which aims to strengthen the protection of a female child in three wards of Tarime district which are Turof, Bomani and Nyamisangura.
