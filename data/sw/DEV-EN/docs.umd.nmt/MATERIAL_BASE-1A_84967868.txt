"It is true we have arrested five vehicles of TFF and those vehicles have been seized as part of a continuation of being able to get revenue generated from the tax debt that TFF have not paid.

"So far we are demanding Bilioni 1.118 which is a mixed tax from 2010 to 2015.
It should be remembered that behind we arrested their account because the debt was to be bilioni 1.6 and we had been able to reduce part of the debt but it still didn't have the reason to capture those five vehicles. "
