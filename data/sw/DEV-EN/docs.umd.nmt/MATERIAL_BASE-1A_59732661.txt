P Square WAMUUMBUA DIAMOND PLATNAM!
This is the ones that have said that they are not saying that.

The musician of P square, Peter Okoye has been shown to be surprised by the report that the Bongo Flavor musician, Naseeb Abdul attended his wedding recently in Nigeria and attended by various stars in the country, the leadership of the purpose of honor Hoham Hotspurs Adebayor.

Previously through various blogs, there were reports that Dimond was the only musician in East Africa who was invited to the ceremony that was attended by one rich number Africa, Aliko Dangote.

Those blogs were gone far by kumpamba Diamond for an amazing surprise, including Michael Jackson of Africa east something that caused many to overonda.

Being interviewed by EATV station just after arriving in Dar es Salaam city for a show that was played at the Leaders Club grounds, Okoye was announced by the reports of Dimond to attend in his wedding.

Okoye was responding to the question that you won with the broadcaster of the Hotmix, Adrian Hilary about Diamond to attend the wedding where he expressed surprised by the name and question Diamond is?

I am surprised there by meaning despite Diamond to chezesha in front of Okoye on the wedding of his wedding but the musician did not know the former akimzying the top of those who had been entertained.
