All the clubs that are participating in the league inayosimamiwa by the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) have been ordered to employ coaches who are qualified according to the regulations.

The report of the Chief Executive Officer of the league board, Boniface Wambura to go to the chief president of the premier league clubs, the first division league and the second one is reminding them to employ coaches who are qualified because it has been noted some have employed or continue to employ coaches who have no qualifications.
That report says the regulation of 72 to all league has aligned the qualifications of coaches who are supposed to lead the technical bench thus going against the regulations is violating the guidelines in the professional area.
According to those principles, the team coach that is participating in the Premier League is supposed to have a license for starting a bridge B of the African Football Federation (CAF) and the assistant coach is supposed to have a license C of CAF.
For the first league league and the second level of the qualified coaches have been closed against because the head coach is supposed to have a form of CAF C and the assistant is supposed to have a certificate of the central level of coaching.
According to those principles, coaches who don't qualify will be removed to teach the team involved.
The legislation did work at the end of the first round of the Premier League where the coach of Toto Africans, John Tegete was removed from the bench due to lack of praise.
