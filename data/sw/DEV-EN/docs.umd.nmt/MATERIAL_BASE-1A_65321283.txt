The government has a great opportunity to stop murder, I will support the prime minister, Kassim Majaliwa that the religious leaders who emee murder because our country has entered into the matwearing of killing, which the past years didn't have ever happened.
We have witnessed the killing of people to be slaughtered like Mwanza, Tanga and Kigamboni (Dar es Salaam).
These incidents didn't demonstrate to the theft of property but it indicates it is tolerance.
If a human being of today will stop falling on the law when it is surrounding hatred between them, these killings will be reduced.
In addition to that, Majaliwa I am asking to understand that the government has a great opportunity to deal with this because it has a dollar like police and military.
There are people who are in mosques with churches, but they don't listen to their leaders because they have their stand.
These even being asked how they are still able to implement their hatred.
II will not be there others do not love the church or when you feel it.
Therefore the government prevails to tackle this.
God A, Arusha, Arusha.
