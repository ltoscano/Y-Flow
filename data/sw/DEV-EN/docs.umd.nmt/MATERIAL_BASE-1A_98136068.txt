The parents to fight in front of children is indiscipline Ingawa every community has its culture, I believe in every community there is no parents who see us proud to quarrel with each other than throwing Makonde in front of their children.
Even if parents have always been angry how it is not the Taarab starting to disagree with clothes while you will give severe words in front of small children.
It is possible today as well as it is a big problem, but any child who has lived witnessing parents being fighting are affected in a certain way in the growth of his child.
The worst thing is to be reached when they even children with their marriages found themselves feel fighting is normal culture, because they have lived in find their mother when he is beaten and locked out of the house or jikoni.
These actions have also made some of the girls not to hate their father and watching them are people who don't have mercy.
Nzugule, Itpoem anda.
