Zitto Kabwe Awajibu Chadema Walio Mtaccusing to corruption through LekaDutigite areas.

I am disappointed that in the state that I have that you have to nursing my mother and are brought into the sewerage politics.

LekaDutigite is owned by the artists.
Gombe Advisors is a company that doesn't make profit (Company limited by guarantee) and does not have any business interests.

Kigoma artists have worked with TANAPA and NSSF, jobs that are known and are there.

Today you call any worker of NSSF will hear the work of those artists.
In any way this is a sign of lack of human beings because they said they know I don't have any financial benefit today or tomorrow by LekaDutigite and Gombe Mshauri.

The period that my mother is in critical condition, again a member of the main committee of their party, the pole I am given that is that.

There's no way to miss the ubinaadamu more than this.
