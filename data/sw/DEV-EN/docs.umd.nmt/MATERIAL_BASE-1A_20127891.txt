E speed of Magufuli and his executive officials in the beginning of dictatorship?
Or is the speed required in the nation this?

Mwalimu Nyerere mara once said that if I wanted to be dicteta I could have been able to.

Why I say he said, let's go together and if you are ongotongo kanawe, and if you have eza viroba sit apart from this post, ONLY great thinkers.

1 - the one.
Threats and HOFU accept or ukatae magufuli now he is afraid of fear of citizens especially employees and business people.

2.
Having been broken by the rights of BINADAMU. right now, you can put the police without kushtakiwa, a tynanny of Paul Makonda to put him a person that was given in the court without taking him to the court is a break of private rights.

3.VUNJWA to the rule of law.
There is a break of the law to open while citizens have been implemented. The itakuelewa utawala wa sheria maana yake ni nini?
Ok just laugh and enjoy but it will b

4.UBABE and arrogance.
You will be visiting the leaders of the leaders now have made a dominance and arrogance which are the reputation of supported, we don't need the leaders, we want the systems that are open from the neighborhood until wilayan kilometers is not a nation.
The person that supports to cancel the holiday of a servant which is his right km so the nanny and dominance nothing else can say.

Conclusion.
I ask you to look at the system of leadership and the administration of the country yetuthan magufuli to chase people every day, the problem is not the people, I am embracing the new constitution for it to start sending it.
Magufuli does not sign the check n balance and the main committee believe m atakuwa a dictator.
