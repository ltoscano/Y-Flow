The Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa has requested all religious leaders to use the homes of worship, to encourage their believers the importance of protecting and maintaining peace and stability in the country. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. He has emphasized that the government will maintain peace and stability in the country with all the strength to enable Tanzania to be sure of continuing to work on their income and bring productivity. The prime minister said that while speaking to the believers of the Muslim religion after finishing the Idd el Haji grounds at the Mwembe Fields, Yanga, Temeke, Dar es Salaam yesterday. Speaking at the Idd council said; "the government will continue to strengthen security in all areas in the country. My call to religious leaders tell us about the protection of peace as well as denounce evil actions so that the nation can move forward. " Majaliwa insisted that the citizens continue to pray for the pilgrims in Makka and Madina in Saudi Arabia, continuing with the Hajj service to get safe. Also the prime minister used that opportunity, to request the citizens to help them in the situation and property of people who were affected by the earthquake in Kagera province, where a total of 16 people died, others were injured and thousands of citizens lack shelter after 840 houses fell by another 1,264 houses to get a crack, including 44 buildings of various public institutions. Previously, while reading the Idd field speech at the field, the international lecturer, Sheikh Nurdin Kishki said Islam is a peace religion, therefore he has requested the Muslims to refrain from acts of breach including the killing of people who are not guilty. Sheikh Kishki said it is important for people to protect peace, as it comes, it is difficult to get it. He gave an example of Libya and Egypt, which until now has failed to restore. He said any person who is involved in the acts of bloodshed, lied to the property of people and a break of his colleagues, he will be stormed, therefore he urged the residents of Temeke especially the residents of Temeke to avoid them. "Temeke is now leading in the events of murder, they killed up to guards. The police have been convicted, this is so painful. The people who were working to protect citizens and their properties are being convicted, "he spoke with sadness and requested the citizens of Tanzania to prevent them from the same actions. Also, Sheikh Mbiki congratulated the fifth term government for showing the commitment to serve the citizens and bring development, therefore he urged the citizens to be on the forefront to cooperate so that the nation can be able to move forward. "My brothers have been given great honor today to pray for Idd and the prime minister, again he has come here at the Mwembe Fields, Yanga, this shows the closeness of our heads to their citizens especially the low level," he said. Bakwata, alia and professionalism of leaders in another step, the Supreme Council of Muslims Tanzania (Bakwata), has urged the Muslims to change by doing things according to the profession so as to avoid leaders with erosion of ethics and not knowing. The Mufti of Tanzania, Sheikh Abubakar Zuberi made the remarks yesterday after Idd prayer at the headquarters of the council, Kinondoni, which was followed by the Idd council that was attended by various government officials. The Mufti said that the time has come for Muslims to change, because they are working against their professions. He also said that the council is expected to open the centers of providing education to increase knowledge 'housing', the aim being to increase skills and knowledge of religious education in the community and the country. "The presence of these facilities will help to provide ignorance and have good leaders from the education of certain positions that read and know to live with people, previously Bakwata has never ever had its religious centers that depend on," he said. In addition, the Mufti urged Muslims in the country to start teaching centers of religion and other subjects like language, technical. He said it is good for every Tanzanian to have bitterness for his country and to discover themselves by working with the ones that brought them by refusing the evil and tolerance so as to bring development. "We are ordered for integrity to do good if there will be no luck in the country, we will enable them to do a service and work... God likes," he said. Moreover, he used that opportunity to pray for those who had a disaster of the earthquake that happened in the provinces of Kagera, Mara and Mwanza recently. On his part, the retired president of the second phase, Ali Hassan Mwinyi said it is good to change and build new Bakwata since the Mufti has shown intentions. "I want my brothers we change us to start with this that he talked of Mufti to show Bakwata, what will it do and it will do what we help because one finger doesn't think this is good," said Mwinyi. He said that every new thing begins with weakness, everyone is supposed to add strength so as to bring change. Shein was concerned with the conflicts of Muslims President of Zanzibar, Doctor Ali Mohamed Shein, speaking at the Idd council, he urged the citizens of Zanzibar to maintain peace and calmness and so as to give an opportunity to the government to implement development plans that in the second phase of its implementation has started well. He said that at the Mkanyageni Secondary School Hall in Pemba, in a speech by the council of Iddi. He said in the next five years, the government is in a step to strengthen community services and development projects, including clean and safe water which for now its implementation has reached 80 percent. He said more emphasis on the availability of that service has been set in the villages, whereby by the year 2020, the service can reach residents by 97 percent. He said that the implementation of clean and safe water projects is going well due to the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar to be supported by international organizations and financial institutions. "My call to the citizens of Unguja and Pemba is to strengthen peace and stability of the country and to love each other so as to give an opportunity to the government to implement its various projects of community services and development... we have started well by using our local energy together with the support of the country's partners of development," he said. He said that great success have been reached in the health sector. On the side of Pemba Island, 27 health centers are in the last stage to be completed including the huge construction of Abdalla Mzee Hospital located in Pemba Province. He said the construction of that hospital being done in great partnership with the government of China, is in the last steps to be completed and make the citizens of Pemba to get all health services in Pemba, without traveling to the island. He Said the hospital has qualified for the referral hospital. On the side of small health centers, he mentioned new stations that will be built to be Ndagoni, Toni, Vienna and Chake-Chake in Pemba Province. "We are committed to ensuring the health sector services are better and reach all citizens including rural areas... we do not want to see a citizen is forced to go to Unguja to look for treatment at a high cost," he said. Furthermore, he said the construction work of the road is going on in Pemba Island and its aim to ease transportation to the villages to strengthen the agricultural sector. He mentioned the roads of Mgagadu to Kiwani with a length of 7.6 kilometers, Kengeja to Ole with a length of 35 tons as well as the road of the class to Ksky has been completed at the rubble. He said all the development will succeed, if the issue of peace and stability will be given priority to the citizens to obey the law together with leaders of political parties. Doctor Shein reminded citizens that among the great training, which is found to Muslims during the Idd el Haj holiday is unity and solidarity. He said that the vigil has caused millions of Muslims, to gather together in the Arafat stadium without caring for their financial capability or glory in their tribes. The Idd issue together with the council was attended by various leaders of the party and the government, including the second Vice President Ambassador Seif Ali Iddi, the minister of state, office of the president and the chairperson of the Revolutionary Council Issa Haji Ussi, the speaker of the House of Representatives Sir Ali Maulid and Knowledge of Zanzibar Khamis Haji.

Written by Lucy Ngowi "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Published: 07 December 2016 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. December every year is a month where many families are united, because many workers tend to take a holiday and students go to school for a long holiday. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. As a result of that reason, many families tend to travel to different areas to change the environment. In the past, the hosts of Kilimanjaro Province had a culture that by this month they must go to their home to celebrate Christmas and New Year holidays. But in recent years, this situation has spread across all provinces of Tanzania, where families may celebrate the holidays with parents or their families in the villages. As a result of this culture, it was built up in many families in the country for this month of December, the bus owners in the provinces have been seeing that is the only area of being sent quickly by increasing the fare for buses. The fare rises every year from 15th this month, due to People travelling in numbers. The program owners increase the fare every day according to the population is increasing. The ones with buses pass the season to be a grace or the harvest because they impose huge fare, because they understand it must get passengers. The fare in fact has been a great pain for many passengers, especially those with low income. For example the years ago, the fare to go to Kilimanjaro or Arusha was between 20,000 and 30,000 shillings, but when it comes to this period of "harvest," rises up to 50,000 to 70,000 shillings. For those who travel this month of December, they will agree with me about the fare, as I explained above, it has been a tradition for people from all provinces to celebrate the holiday in where they were born. A good example is at the central bus station of Ubungo in Dar es Salaam city, where in the period from December 15 to 24, most of the buses have already been completed, that is the passengers have already paid tickets early. But there has also been a dirty game to some of the people who call themselves the bus agents. They have been buying those tickets early with the aim of selling them at high prices. And this period the passengers are usually many in that bus station because they lack the transportation of going to where we are headed. This thing we have been witnessing for all the years, although three years ago the Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA), has been able to act by beating all the fines that increase the price, a step that has reduced the little to them. I am saying Summer has reduced the problem because when they inspected the fares of those buses, they are showing that they have been sold at the normal price, but many citizens are complaining to be sold by those agents at high prices. My request to SUMATRA is to ensure that it will control this situation to happen this year. It will use all the tactics to arrest a few clever people who hurt the citizens by switching off the tickets in this festive season, who they call the season of harvest. In order to stop this situation, it is good for passengers to give information early when they meet the trouble, although others feel it's okay because they have been prepared to travel and they have the ability to pay any fare. I am sure if citizens will cooperate well with the state agencies, there will be no haphazard increase in fare in this Christmas season and the new year. "But I'm not Going to do it.

Despite that directive, he has also ordered the Roads Agency (TANROADS) and the supervisors of that project to inspect the quality of the bridge if it has the required standards before starting to be used. He gave that directive after the citizens of that area to complain about the delay of the project that was mentioned in the year 2013. After those complaints, Makonda asked the member of parliament of Segerea, Bonna Kaluwa, as he once arrived at the bridge to inspect the construction where he admitted and joined the citizens accusing the contractor for delaying the construction of that bridge. "I am here five times and the contractor told me this bridge would have been completed within four days since April 2016 but until now it has not been completed and my citizens are continuing to suffer," said Bonna. The answer made Makonda wanting Masatu to put open the contract of that bridge was signed when he answered that the contract was signed on March 30th, 2015 and started on June 30, 2015. However, the representative of the Texas Company, Musiba denied the construction reports to start in the year 2013 and claimed that it took place on April 29 this year. "This bridge is under the agency of roads (TANROADS), therefore we are waiting to get a permit to demolish some of the areas that are reviewed by this project from Ilala Municipality," he said. Makonda said that if the construction will not end in that period, he will not be given any tender in Dar es Salaam. In another step, Makonda instructed the police commander of Kipolisi, Ilala, Salum Hamlow to arrest the chairman of Bonyoby, Solomon Kagaruki, on accusations of not implementing its responsibilities including taking bribes, threatening citizens and also alleged to take 10 percent of the price of the plots that are sold.

" (Philosopher David Hume) Kuna while traveling to Finland. There he was very surprised to see a lot of tractors have been placed on one farm. I asked my host; where? "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. I felt that it is a culture of farmers in that country. Every year I have a farming competition for sectors. The farmers of one area may be in their colleague's farm and made those competitions; they are looking for who has been above his colleagues in making the lyrics, growing rapidly, and so on. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Only in Finland, I understood, that the culture started since the era of hydrogen. The tractors were in farming, it happened to one farmer, prompting his colleague; "do your tractor is the same as the strength of many horses? It is in that environment, even the measure of horses will begin to be used; horse Power, it means the horse is used even today in testing the energy of various machines. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. I will speak about the importance of social capital (Social Capital) and civil society (Civil courage) so as to uplift the economy of one person and eventually lift the economy of the country. For the society and the country in general, it needs to have this important capital. The growth of social cooperation in various activities, be sad or celebration, it is an example of the existence of a good foundation of social capital. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. This concept of social and social capital may be new to some of us. However, it is something that we witnessing every day. We see different social groups increasing. Today we have examples of the communities that are denied, we have the communities of lending and many others. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Let us take this example of the community with cooperation in celebration, for instance, wedding. In the meantime, entertainment spots is no surprise you meet with people who are in the session of the organizing committee of the wedding. It is these committees with planning to make a wedding. Sometimes regarded even what is called a "wedding day!." "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The wedding committee will meet even twice a month. And often they meet for luxury spots after hours of work. The committee will air strategies to make the wedding as other members of the committee without beer. And even when they make a wedding, they will meet again as a special committee for "breaking" the committee. They will quickly eat, they will fill it. A Fungu of doing that is also planned in the wedding budget! "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. While our colleagues in Finland are competing in development activities, we, together with our poverty, we are still competing in doing a great luxury. We use millions of shillings to do the wedding of "dying people" while there are people who died in poverty. They are dying because the road from their villages up to the districts of the districts are not used! There are people who die for lack of money to buy drugs for their diseases. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Let you recognize it closely this concept of social and social capital by checking the writings of Professor Robert Putnam in his book; Making Democracy Work (make Democracy work). Professor Putnam, an American, gave his book in 1993. He and his colleagues did research by checking two areas of Italy; north and south. This was 70 years old. The two parts of Italy have been with the economic development that is different from this today. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Italy's Southern is poor, compared to Italy in northern Italy. Professor Putnam through the study notes, that this is coming from Italy in South Africa missing what Italy has an issue. The people of Italy in the north for many years have had a culture of joining together in different communities of the things that they like; there are a community of choir members, communities of fishermen, the communities of going to watch the plane. There is also a community or different sports clubs. In general, there are many communities of people from their privilege. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. But the primary thing he saw Professor Putnam is the fact that participants in these communities are out of checking their personal interests and the community. It begins to look at the interests of the whole community in the meaning of the nation. This is when it comes to the concept of civil society. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The civil society is the state of a person to discover themselves as a citizen in the country, and that if a citizen has a responsibility to put the interests of the country he was born and registered his citizenship. He has a responsibility to participate in building his country. The capital of social, civil society and trust is three radical things that according to Professor Putnam, have fun to grow to the economy of the region or the concerned country. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Professor Putnam and his colleagues are revealing that Italy in South Africa has maintained its development because of its people to look more than personal interests and those of the families around them. It is in South Italy where until today we heard there are groups of fund as the famous Mafia district. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. When we get rid of scientific explanations and professionals more than this Professor, let's look at the situation in our country. Indeed, this social capital is established in our society, Tanzania as a country can make steps of development. We look like these wedding committees and the burial sites that are planning and using millions of shillings for the "wedding of people" and preparing a burial, perhaps for "people to come!" They would put the power too in looking for family activities. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. That for the same procedure they would have formed an infrastructure committee for our streets. They should have been making strategies to ensure that money is driven by people are encouraged to make holes on the local roads, with dirty water that is being raised. That should be the "dying person." Locks, neighborhoods, districts and provinces by involving citizens competing for such activities of construction of the nation. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Let it reach a place also, those who have put the selfish feel better in the community. They are not given the qualifications to put their selfishness and even by sabotage the public property. Today in our country, the leader is proud to drop in the public car and allow the driver to continue to fly the vehicle engines until he came back to the big work. The car can stand up with the engines being sent even for the whole hour! Destroy the oil and tax of citizens. That big one when he is with his driver in his private car, she's turned out when the driver is unable to shut down the engines while he has gone down to make the purchase at the store. Then he will see the pain of the fuel that is planned for free. He thought about the cost of fuel with his pocket. But with a public car, he does not see the pain of the oil, he destroys the government! That is where the lack of civilian casualties. Lack of patriotism. It is examples of the actions that are entertaining behind development. This debate will continue. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

When we have organized we can improve our towns yesterday we published news about the Kinondoni Municipality plan in Dar es Salaam city, to demolish all the random houses and then put it in a modern shape. Speaking to Mwananchi in a special interview, the mayor of that municipality, Benjamin Sitta said the plan is expected to start in the year 2018, is part of the development strategies of the municipality. For starting, he said they have planned to breathing a popular village in Tandale and to build in a special modern system. This is a step of being added because that is in Kinondoni is a sign of the situation in many areas in the country. Primarily, many areas in the country are hooded and this is a result of not getting urban towns early or the absence of effective management in areas that at least be remembered for the existence of urban planning. The effects of having towns that are built in all we see. For example, areas where the map of urban planning are being targeted or because of sports grounds or holidays, school expansion or hospitals or government buildings, we have witnessed being attacked and built houses to live and others for business activities. Also, we have witnessed those who have money taking away and build houses in areas of road reserve and maybe above the water pipes and fuel. What's worse, there are some who in the nanny of money they dare to even fill the gutter that stop dirty water and thus causing a big problem to other residents as sewerage is careless especially during rains. We added that Kinondoni Municipality for a one that is supposed to be followed by other parts of the country. However, we want to ensure that this plan becomes sustainable and to organize themselves to implement its ability. We are saying that especially considering that our country has built a period of years and go back to having many plans, but only a few if it is implemented and many are threatening them in the office of executives. We have a good example of developing a park near the Kinondoni District offices. Since it was announced that the area will be improved and have a unique attraction several years ago, until now nothing is going on. Outside Kinondoni, there are many examples of strategies to develop towns, but so far it is not understandable. A good example is the modern towns of Kigamboni and Luguruni. We don't believe that Mayor Sitta wants to make popularity, it should be remembered that this is a big project and if you will succeed in Kinondoni in a unique chapter in the country, therefore, it is a must for the municipality to prepare because its process will need many resources. To plan is to choose, if we have chosen to improve our towns, we must have a concrete and true commitment, in the start of our local resources. We are not aware of anywhere like every day we will have plans and strategies while depending on the extent of the support of resources especially money from donors or foreign donors. Together with that, we are saying the plan of Kinondoni Municipality, you should give us other areas in the country. Ugandans want to see better and modern towns, not Kinondoni alone, but every corner of the country. When we have organized that, the era of our areas are complete, they will have reached the day.

Walk while there is no queue "Car remains in the queue, so the vehicle will play down and therefore use a lot of fuel," said the National Institute of Transportation. Kyando said the queue is one of the biggest reasons why fuel is used in large numbers and therefore it is important for people walking while there are no traffic vehicles. He said apart from using large numbers, vehicles also use a lot of fuel in queue due to the use of air conditioning. He said it is important to shut down the air conditioning in the queue so as to protect oil, "If there is a lot of queues and vehicles have been standing, it is good to find AC and a car. If the queues is going on, don't use AC, set up screens, because in the queues using more fuel if it will leave AC if it is Shia. " Such comments were made by taxi driver in Buguruni in Dar es Salaam city, Issa Minister Burhan who is keen in using fuel to make sure he gets profit. "AC is something I'm looking very much because I use a lot of oil while standing in the queue. Air conditioning causes the engines to use a lot of energy, but if the speed is not using a lot of fuel, it's okay and if you do not call it. My benefit is due to the preservation of oil, "said Burhan who made that work for eight years now. For a long journey, use air conditioning, when it causes oil to be lost in the queues, air conditioning is important for a long journey. Engineer Kyando said that the casings are open to the wind to be flooded and there were in the past and causing a car to use a big force to go ahead, something that causes many fuel. Many drivers tend to stop screens during the long journey, believing that sleep is lost when the wind comes to the face. The drivers' habit, another reason for the loss of oil is the habit of drivers of running a vehicle at a fast speed without the reason and taking over the fuel without a order. "When you add a speed at the accelations, it is going to the procedures according to the needs of your vehicle at the same time," said Hussein Khalfan, senior director of the AMC who are agents of Nissan. He said the competitions of the competition takes a lot of fuel due to the drivers taking over the fuel for violence so as to ensure they are using a short time. "The vehicles of the competition can use a lot of fuel until the whole bank for two hours when the fuel can be used for a journey of 700 kilometers," he said and advised drivers to step down the fuel as the journey continues instead of taking over the violence. He said in the areas like you, the driver does not need to step down the fuel. The care of the vehicle Experts also said that the care of the vehicle, which is together with working on service will avoid the big use of oil. "The creator or the owner is required to do a car to check the engines every period that was outlined in a kilometer. He is supposed to change the weather because if the air did not know well, it will cause disaster to the engines because it will not have a force and if they force them to regain them, "said Engineer Kyando. Khalfan said the regular inspection helps make the vehicle stop using a lot of fuel. "Due to the engines of the vehicle using oxygen (oxygen) to burn oil, it is important to inspect oxygen sensor, air filter which can be completely surrounded by causing dirty oxygen to get into combustion Chamber (where petrol is set to produce the power of crack shaft). Clean air is very important. Kagan air cleaner, "said Khalfan. He said the old vehicles were using carctor but modern vehicles are using Fuel injector so it is good to be elected. The structure of the vehicle, the vehicle is also important in dealing with the ecause of oil, but that would happen before the owner bought it. "It is a must that the owner to consider the elections of a broad vehicle in front to avoid the wind power that causes them to use a lot of strength to go ahead," said Engineer Kyando. "It is required a vehicle when it is running the wind back then without being blocked by the car because there was blocking, they have forced it to use a big force to go ahead and therefore use a lot of fuel." The heavy cargo of cargo also causes a car to use a big force walking and therefore using a lot of fuel. He also adds to fuel until it is another reason that makes a car to use a lot of fuel without reasons. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

On November 25, this year, we started 16 days of opposing gender violence. 16 days of opposing gender violence is an international campaign that started at the first meeting of the Women's Global Leadership Institute (Women's Global Leadership Institute), sponsored by the Association of Women's Global Leadership Center (Center for Women's Global Leadership), in 1991. Participants chose on November 25, International Day Against Women Against Women, and December 10, World Human Rights Day, in order to involve violence against women and human rights as well as encouraging that violence as violation of human rights. The 16-Day period is also looking for another important Day, including November 29, which is the Day for Human Rights Defenders, December first, World AIDS Day and December 6, a Memorial for Montreal. Violence against women is a violation of human rights, it's a humanitarian crisis in society and a barrier to reach equality, development, security and peace. The words "violence against women" and "gender violence" are used to meaning the sequence of violence taking place against women, resulting from lack of gender equality and the minimum of women in society compared to men. In 1993, the United Nations Declaration on eradicate violence against women as: "Any act of sexual violence that causes or can cause pain or physical abuse, sexual or mental pain for women, including threats, forced or being denied freedom taking place in the community or in personal life." It is estimated that one of the three women in the world will face certain types of gender violence in his life. Therefore it is very clear that against gender violence is women, although it is not a must that this violence is done by the only men. The goal of these 16 days is against gender violence, but many days have been taken to protest against violence against women. And a limited view is violence by men to women. But the real situation and events of the day and especially here in Tanzania show very different, to the extent of making gender violence to be a uncertainty. Even if you look at the international human rights contracts and the resolutions reached within the United Nations to deal with violence against women and that need the government to take action against women, including the agreement to eradicate types of crimes against women (CEDAW, 1979), the agreement to eradicate violence against women, including the agreement to eradicate drugs against women (CEDAW, 1979), an agreement to eradicate violence against women, including the agreement to eradicate those groups of women, peace and security (2000) and other others. A big wave of oppress the domestic workers that a big percentage are girls that makes a lot of a t-shirt the whole concept of gender violence. Harassment is largely implemented by women. Although at some point, these domestic workers are oppressed and sexually assaulted by men, like sexually harassing or selling small houses, but severe pain against their personality and their freedom are loved by women. But, in a certain amount is run by women. Those who bring young girls in one place and especially in big towns and using them sexually, it is a certain kind of culture in Mara province, where women are married with the aim of having girls using them sexually and earning children. This culture is known as Nyumbantobu. In this culture, a girl who is married to a woman, has no freedom of any kind and his body or with the children that he is doing. This is the type of gender violence, who although they are being treated for women, but not the violence of men. "The number of men arriving at the police station complaining of being beaten and their wives began growing rapidly in Dar es Salaam city," that was said by the acting police officer, Adolphina Chialo, when he was speaking at a meeting of the commemoration of 16 days of opposing gender violence, coordinated by women organization in law and development (WiLDAF).

By our writer, Dar es Salaam despite the presence of women in the aviation industry to be small, the ability to be leaders in air travel is no taboo. Speaking to this newspaper, the first woman to lead a plane of Airbus A380 owned by Fastjet Tanzania, pilot Anne-Marie Lewis says women in Africa should not fear being part of this growing sector in the continent. He says it is not a hard work for a woman to be the pilot and that he is confident and he has no fear in any matter that is why he is trusted and got an opportunity to wait for that plane in the provinces of Tanzania and other neighboring countries. "Women should understand that there is no type of work that is meant for men alone, but women will bring in the air travel sector their ability to work hard, raising their skills of better supervision," he says. According to Lewis, African women need to understand that their intentions and decision will remove fear or economic losses. He says that their ability to do anything, where they will put their thoughts on what they want to do will be the inspiration of their goals. He notes that he started down completely but his intention to get into this field that was dominated by men and for the regular help from his father was the foundation of the success that he has got until now.

The secretary general of the National Sports Council (BMT) has wanted the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) to change and stop using a lot of time to discuss the issues of the coach they left instead of discussing how they can help the development of Tanzanian soccer. That issue has been troubled by many stakeholders because the officials of that federation have been discussing the salary issues of the former coach of the Taifa stars Charles Mkwasa instead of knowing the plans they have through the interim coach to take the national team. He said that TFF should stop continuing to discuss the news of the coach who was left and instead he has urged them to focus on the right way of running the Tanzanian soccer and eventually doing well at the international levels. He said that many leaders have been running things in practice and find themselves working on the sidelines, the situation that makes Tanzania soccer to be lower as the days will continue to move forward. "I don't see if there is a need to call the media and feel to pay the coach because there is no benefit in the sports world because there is no benefit in the sports world because there is nothing they can learn under football leaders more than to continue to promote conflicts," said Kiganja. On his side, Lucas Mponela said that TFF has been the best to talk about Mkwasa's salary and to stop the important issues of conflicts of players and finding a solution to the problem that bothers them. He said there are many charges that had been taken by different clubs and complain about their rights but TFF have been fired without working on their grievances and find problems every day due to following their rights for a long time. He added that the issue of paying the salary Mkwasa was a secret of two sides, therefore there was no reason for TFF to put open those issues, something that showed losing time in doing so many basic issues. Mkwasa was sentenced to his contract with TFF a few days ago with his contract with his contract with a period of three months to train the national team and his position was taken by the interim coach, Salum Mayanga who has already started his work.

Possible things to attract a man on their wives - 2 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. We saw in the previous article that a man needs a lot of recognition. You have no reason to tell the man you love her. The language of love that he is understood is to be commended. In line with this first, we saw a man she has a hungry man. Respect is to tell him even when he is in the face of language, words and behavior. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Photo: Citifmonline.com "But I'm not Going to do it.

Freedom and privacy is certainly the opposite of what women need as we will see in the future. But for a man, the truth is that he needs to feel a person with freedom to do things that he is happy without being told another of the differences should do. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. For example, if your husband loves the ball, the truth is that he desires for the cooperation. It is able to try to enjoy the ball will highlight his heart in a different way. Whatever he wouldn't want to make your husband during his extra time, he has Never been given a chance to be with him without showing him except when it is a must. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. If he has the things that we love and do not destroy your life, join him. It is possible, he has Never been freedom of loving his things. You don't have a reason, for example, to make him stop with his friends if they do not affect your relationship. You have no reason to make him stop going to the areas that he would like to do so doesn't bring harm. Never have a chance to be Independent. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Likewise, freedom goes hand in hand with requiring privacy. Basically, if a woman, sometimes you desire to understand everything he is doing in your husband. You need to know his communication, he has talked to who, he has divorced and who has known him and if possible to know every point of his thoughts. Maybe you can even be convinced to investigate in secret. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. However, for many men, this is not funny. Men are peaceful to have a chance to do their things without being investigated. They don't like to see how they were done to be private. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. If you are interested to have a relationship that has come up in the foundation of trust, do not believe in order for his will to allow him to interfere with his private life.

A individuals who are impressed by the body "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Although human beings have a selfishness in the origin, but the selfishness of a man continues to be a woman. But the men feel More aware of him and his needs. Sometimes even in the times that you think about himself, it is easy for a man to put him. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. This kind of disappointing himself first, has a relationship with his own. God has set up a man in his eyes. Greed is emphasized on a man's knowledge, normally, selfishness is born. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Except in the environment that a man has changed his soul, he says he loves you often thinking about his physical needs. He is thinking about your physical qualifications that can meet its greed. This is a difference to women. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. If you want to convince a man, ensure it continues to attract physically. Consciousness is impressed and you want to place in the way he is expecting. The big offence makes many women forget when they get married. When you hear of them as much as it was before marriage, you trigger a man's selfish. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Don't make sense. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. As a continuation of the authority we saw as an epicenter, a normal man wants to feel that he is still needed. A man wishes to feel that things are not going on without him. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The men are growing up by the community, age friends and sometimes through their own father's actions that they will be able to reduce problems. And how does this belief in the mind of a man's mind, we say a man believes is a maid of the problems we don't know in the authenticity. The man likes to be the answer to all things. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Any attempt to show a man that even if you do not have anything, even if you do not give any idea, there is nothing that will make him make 'sabotage' relationships. To make sense, there is affecting its own stance (ego) and may be the beginning of the problems. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

Every human being does not like to feel there is someone where he has a plan to change. Many times when we feel we are transformed, we are heard to lie. As a defensive effort, often the relationship with that is trying to change the affected. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. For a man, a feeling of feeling when a partner wants to change is very big. For a man it is a criminal offence when he discovered there is his folks. When a man is aware you changed us, he sees himself as a person who lost his authority. He didn't accept it easily. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. It is true that there are things that you think is important to change. For example, friends pointed out his time that he could use it with the family, maybe he does not have inspiration and faith, maybe it is the work he does or certain behaviors. I tried to show the interest in changing. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

I have given an example of how the families of the critics are determined to invest in their children's education. Even if it is a family that brought together the father and mother who loved a luxury in their first youth (before they give birth) the couple will not change when they are faced with the issue of raising their children and give them everything that will assure them good upbringing and life of efficiency. This means that they will make sure that children get a good place to get to the right, clean housing, good accommodation, food and adequate nutrition, the protection of the disease, testing of their health frequently, and the quality of behavior that will enable them to be good in their lives. Then, education. Education is together with the good upbringing that they are getting children in their home, in the community that they left, in the village or street and also in school. The school has been an agent of the family and the community of the village or estate in the activities of developing a child education where parents can't go forward in the borders of the family and the village community or the street cannot be advanced in its borders. Parents and family members are fulfilling their responsibility until their limit. The community of the village and street communities are fulfilling their responsibilities until they are studying, and the child is going to school where the responsibility of the continuation of education and child care is received by the teachers and other servants of that institution of education. From the family, village, street to school and college, all of this is a continuation of the main activity of bringing and creating a community community who will be beneficial to him, for his family, in his village or its neighborhood, and for the whole nation and even a wide range of international community and the whole world. That is how they found teachers with qualifications, they are hically, public servants who have improved, leaders who leave their points in the community, the defending of every good thing by opponents of all the evil in the world. They all take a look at the steps I've seen above. If you read biographical (stories of life) of people like Mafate Gandhi, Jawaharlal Neil, Julius Nyerere, Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr and others, we get an image of the people who were exposed through all the steps to reach their youth of good work in the world. The most important is that they were taken care of the care of justice, equality and dignity. Their actions with young people have shown the qualifications that were caused by the way they were coming from childhood. (By who wants to follow this, there are many biographical books here in the country and in neighboring countries, Europe, the United States and Asia that show how senior leaders were raised and educated. Now here in the country, it is found in the book of a youth at edinburgh University, Thomas Molony, who writes about the life of childhood and youth of Julius Nyerere: Nyerere, the Every years. Molony is getting into a more sensitive environment that grew up Nyerere, a culture that brought up, training from mother and other family members, the content of his initial education, and later in secondary school, and also to the University of edinburgh, Uskochi. Parents, close relatives, the village of the village, the teachers who met with them in school and in colleges, both were one of the knowledge, skills, education, and not stole them in Kambarage and became the same to his death). Contrary, you are visible from the qualifications that are contrary to those that I mentioned by. Many children who were born and tortured in the families of thieves and who were not lucky to get tired of the village communities or the street, they are crying in theft and finally, they will be big thieves, criminals and corrupt, because that is the knowledge they got, and that is the education they got. Silika of theft will make it sometimes to be his own assets if he has lost a person to marry him. The same for a child who is born and raised in the environment of conflict and conflicts in the family or street and in the village. Wherever he is and the fight will go, and without a fight he will make it. When we say that a child can't know, that's what it means. There are true stories of human children being raised by animals like fox and babe, and they were found with the behavior of those guardians. So it is very important for the upbringing of the children of any nation prepared, supervised, coordinated and controlled so that it can be possible for education and training, behavior and behavior of the people of this nation to conform to and those that are not big so that the country should not have a strong character. I've got to ask, and until now I ask: This is what is introducing the national football of Tanzania? It's hospitality? 'It's gentle.' He's a weak defense? Is it credibility and truth? What is the quality of education for our children? Is it patriotism that makes love for the country and its people? Is it the defense of the weak and hatred against injustice and oppression? Or is the violence to the weak? Is it lies, fraud, tension, tension and hypocrisy? "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_64528237 Yanga, have not received the secretary that suit them? Dec 04, 2014 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. There is a time I had to say through one of my newspaper in this newspaper that, so as to be a leader in the Simba and Yanga clubs, you need to have certain behaviors. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. I see some of those behaviors such as a whip and a person to give numerous promises when you want to contest for various positions, even if you see that there is no friendly environment for enable you to implement those promises. But it should also be a person to withstand conflicts and violence in the country and there from the members of those clubs. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. This situation was there in those old clubs, there is now and will continue to be there if the whole system of leading Simba and Yanga will not change. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The big problem in these clubs is leaning towards the decision that has often been done by members, or through the sessions and official meetings or informal meetings. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. There is a time it seems that some of the members of these clubs are there for their interests and not for the interests of those clubs. For example, it has been a group of groups in these clubs whose days come up during conflicts and not during the development plans. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. This system of these clubs who have been nominated, there is a possibility of taking them to the clubs more than here in the country. History shows that Simba and Yanga clubs have been blamed for a long time in the premier league and to show jokes that has caused those teams to have many lovers. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. There is no foundation that took place on the side of investment in the soccer of this country more than different leaders who have been getting into power to have ghost plans. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Perhaps this may be allocated by some of the members of those clubs with ideas of looking closely and not far. The majority of these clubs are raising regular disputes from members to the leadership. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. At the end of the week there were reports of the former secretary general of Yanga, Beno Njovu to release the level, but more reports say that he has finished his term, according to the contract he had with that club. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. There is no one who refused that Njovu has not finished his term, but the way he used to release the stairs for the announcement through the media is the ones that they were in. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Njovu, who came to power in January this year, taking the position of Lawrence Mwalukasa, has been leaving office in that style that he received Mwalukasa. For Now accounts, Yanga has made changes to three secretaries within 15 months. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Before Mwalukasa was there, Celestine Mwesigwa, who is currently the secretary general of Tanzania Football Federation (TFF). Yanga has also ever brought the secretary general from Kenya, Patrick Nagi, the elders of Yanga accused him because he is not a member of Yanga. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. We are back there that some members have a decision without knowing what it means. They have forgotten that that is an opportunity to be employed and neither the position of members to vote as they do with the chairman and other leaders. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The secretary is a key leader in any institution. He is a leader who is supposed to be responsible in broad in his institution. This means that he is responsible for a long-term plans and for a short time. As I had previously said previously, which has ruled the ball in our big club are members who sometimes fail to recognize their positions. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. At the same time, the secretaries were elected, they were sitting in power for a long time. And after the secretary came to power he was trying to create a certain group that if there will be any problem to be ready to defend him. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. These days have changed after those positions are being announced and people are employed by their professional qualifications. There are several things to consider for at least the secretaries who are employed in these clubs to be able to sit for a long time so as to implement the plans they made for the sake of development. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. What is seen for now the position of the secretary for Simba club and Yanga is as the registration of a player. It means that the leadership can build a difficult environment due to personal reasons he hate his employment and he decided to release his level. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. As it is for some of the leaders to intervene in the office of their coaches in various decisions including registration, that is how it is for the leaders to interfere with the responsibilities of their secretaries. The current secretaries for our old clubs have turned out to be the departments, because of the leadership of the club wanting to do everything. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. In this ongoing situation in the Yanga club to change the secretaries, it is a must for members and leaders to look at afresh while knowing that the problem is in that club. If not to the members is for leadership. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. There is a certain disorder to some people wanting what they are saying without being opposed. But for the position of the secretary general, he is supposed to be given a chance to do his work without interference without the basic reasons. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Perhaps Yanga were supposed to be hopeful for depending on this style of making a look for depend on "Sterling one, and they are continuing to build themselves by making their plans to end up in the words and papers, to benefit a few clever. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Without changing in this, things will be those that are inside Yanga club. His translations may be as a dictatorship. Or is it saying that Yanga have not got the secretary that suit them until now that is why they have been employed every after a short time? "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

The union of youths of the Revolutionary Party (UVCCM) have said that it is a shame to the leaders that have ever been given higher bail and the government to lead the administration of the administration and fail, to start criticizing their colleagues on non-basis accusations.

The acting secretary general of UVCCM, Shaka Hamdu Shaka, gave the statement in this province yesterday when he visited the water distribution project and inspected new wells of clean and safe water that are used to distribute water in Kiniha Ward in Biharamulo district in this province. He said it is surprising to listen to the leader and the politician especially Lowassa who once served as the minister of water and livestock later that the prime minister was unable to solve the water problem until he resigned from the Richmond scandal. Undoubtedly he said it is not good for someone with the opposition to denounce even the good things that are done by the government. "Lowassa is denounced and criticize because he is against President Doctor. Magufuli, a person who wants to give a bamboo eye on your colleague's eye, he should remember him he was a minister with a bond of water, but he also failed, "insisted Shaka. The acting secretary general of UVCCM urged the government officials and the district council to continue their partnership and to recognize that they have a bond of serving the citizens and solve the problems that they are facing. He urged the government leaders at the concerned level to understand that there is no need to listen to accusations or criticisms that are provided by the opponents because their work is to say every day and the work of the government is to act and demonstrate in actions. "I am happy to see the leaders in the DC office to work together and in collaboration with the district council, we all are in an effort to build a stable house, therefore there is no need for the management of the CCM manifesto of 2015-2020, the President has said that you are making your ability in actions," said Shaka.

Here I would like to remind of also the famous saying that you are saying; "the child you know." " When he saw his family continues to expansion and his parents are still living in a big house, prompting her father that it is good for him to each other with his parents, because they are only two, then they live a small house of a servant. According to the story, that is where his father ran out and took action. What he did is to pay her child house for six months and accusing them that during that period he will repair a big house together with the sleeping house of a servant and then they will return to those houses to live. Therefore, the young man agreed as he said his elder. In that period, the father was forced to reduce the use of his child and putting them into business so that he does not continue being dependent on everything. Before a period of six months ended, the father will sell his house and moving to another area without his son to know. When it came back to their house he found another house and remained open. The efforts to repeat of his father told him that he does not even have money to pay for a house without being told it is his responsibility to preserve his family and not otherwise. What follows is a cry and grinding teeth for being faced with the thick darkness of life. This story is enough for the young people who come from the authority and power of their parents are vulnerable to them as they have positions and power like that. There are children of directors, provincial heads and districts and even popular business people who have seen that they do not need to work for their lives because they have not seen them having power and those properties as they are their parents. They think that they don't need to feel looking for their property. This is a misconception and the youth must change. This is possible that we should stop being complacuated by the property that are not yours. Look for your name because they are rushed, they say "a lot of charities are poor."

Some women have been concerns not only for men, but even to their fellow women around them. Equally important to write this topic, this is the habit of some of these women not following their bodies and decided to wear their empty clothes publicly. Some have been doing that on the excuse of going to and when, despite me, they are still in mind. Now in those they have gone ahead and make a joke even in the house of worship. Guys in the fashion issue is good to know that, every place there is his approach to the whites that call him 'dress code'. The office's clothes is not the same as the one that is born in the bury, or the sbury is not the same as the one that is born in the celebration. The teachers' clothing is not the same as the doctor. These things are not limited there, as they go to the homes of worship. In recent years, there has been a new fashion to make houses for worship as part of the beauty competition especially for women. Worse, you are putting your children clothing that do not go with a Tanzanian culture. What the naked clothes you are going on, that is what I want to sign up with the children. Again in the place of worship. I Don't know exactly what I want to make it there. We should be sure that each of us is supposed to be clean in front of God but this cleaning does not live to wear trousers, to stop some sensitive areas outside or wearing a short clothes! I know that all of you are aware of the special clothing to wear in the house of worship and instead you are intentional. I think this is us with us and not otherwise. I understand it is not many who are aware of the dangers of crucking clothes, especially when you go to the holy place like in the habahu of God. And you don't know you don't dare even one day to wear those clothes. When I talk about madineahu I think everyone is aware that it is religion especially when I aim. Among those effects first is to build children who were worried about their creator. For them, they will follow how you do what you are doing and therefore wear those that are not wrong in the church. And normally the children will not end there. Because the action of entering and evaluate the church will take a young man, an issue that will bring the hope to them. In that logic, there will be no ideas of God again, except that the rule of the devil. Let me say the truth from my heart that, in this I have no problem with the believers of all religious denominations. Because they are aware of how to wear while in their places of worship. They do not know exactly like religious books. And because they don't have the process of confusion during this service, it is still not a big problem. In these things that are not wrong, I would like to beat him with a couples especially female. What I understand me is that you have got different types of training for a period not less than a week before marriage. A class on good clothing that is good on the day of marriage is one of those trainings. Surprisingly, on the day of the marriage service, you are coming to him on the shoulder. Is it forgetting or arrogant? Let's be afraid of your God. They have not stopped the house of worship. When you are not part of the dressing room, it is a personality to meet your imagination with your God. Therefore, it is not badly getting ready to get in that environment. Wearing what is acceptable to your God and not otherwise. This issue of trapped 'fashion Police' on the doors of churches is a shame to the believers and the church in general. Because it does not tell you in mind, you are your colleague instead of praying, and go on the door to inspect who is wearing a bikini? Badilla! You are not afraid of your God, tell you as it was ordered in your religious books, if you need to examples with the workers of the church or masista as they wear, that is the right answer for the dressing room that should be born in your own homes.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_93115278 We what we want is to remove CCM only "Aug 19, 2015 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. As I had promised in the past article, this week I continues with my analysis on the general elections expected to take place on October 25th this year. And as it was in the past few posts, my analysis will be in the race for the presidential position. While in the past article I discussed the opportunity and obstacles to the candidates "two heads, that is Doctor. John Magufuli of CCM and Edward Lowassa of Chadema / UKAWA this week I will come in more details, with the aim being to use this article to make an analysis to one candidate, and the next week's article will look at the other candidate. Let me start with Lowassa of Chadema / UKAWA. Between the past article and this, it is not a secret that the worst news is what is called "flood of Lowassa." All the activities that involve the politician in that period has protested by a huge crowd of people, from when he took the forms of vying for the presidency in Dar es Salaam to the meetings that was introduced in Mbeya, Arusha and Mwanza. The numbers of people who are coming out in the activities of Lowassa, whether it is by protesting or attending meetings, it has made great hopes that the way the former prime minister heading to the State House is white. In line with the big attendance, several members of CCM have left the ruling party and joined Chadema. But the big one is to move to some of the leaders "who had names" inside CCM. That protests and meetings are urging many people, that has no debate. That the upcoming events of the politician will continue to fill people, it is also not an issue of discussion. Likewise, there are members and more CCM leaders to follow Lowassa in Chadema as a surprise. We should not allow us to conclude by sure this time is if you have shifted from that of some of the members of CCM and their leaders to follow them, that Chadema will be interpreted in victory in the next general elections on October 25, approximately two months from now. Despite the presence of great inspiration about registration in the voter register that has been improved by the technology to store a record on computer (Biometric Voter register (short BVR), until this time the National Electoral Commission has not given the full number of those who registered themselves. But despite that, there are already signs of errors in BVR's issue where they have been released several reports of those who registered to see their names while doing sure. The size or the smallness of the errors has not been known as the National Electoral Commission (NEC) has not comment on the issue. Here I will join those two issues above, that is the majority of the people who are coming out in Lowassa's activities and registration exercise BVR. It comes out to conclude that in large numbers of people who are coming out in the activities of that politician can have its benefit from his party in general, then the first majority of those people, if not all, must be registered to vote. However, their numbers will remain a history. But in the experience we have many, registering voting is one issue, succeeding to vote is another issue, and to vote for a certain candidate and the vote to help him is another matter. I have been talking about the previous articles that one of the biggest benefits to CCM is a biased relationship between him and various public institutions. And I expect most of your relatives, you have heard the cries of opposition politicians roughly since the start of a multi-party system that those who vote for their votes are punished by the ruling party for the support of public institutions. " Although all the accusations have continued to remain the allegations, the environmental evidence is heading to signing those accusations. Personally, I have been following up on the general elections online, particularly on social media. Recently, I warned Lowassa's fans about their joy as a result of the audience in the public activities that involve that politician. I reminded me about the previous elections, especially "the speed of (itus Lyatonga) Mrema," the former presidential candidate in the general elections of 1995 through the NCCR-Evolution party, how he used to be popular to fill the mass of people in his meetings, but threatened to have been dropped by the CCM candidate, Benjamin Mkapa. I also reminded me about the numbers of People that came to the Doctor's campaign meetings. Doctor Willibrod Slaa, the former presidential candidate on Chadema ticket in the last general elections, in the year 2010, but he fails to meet the CCM candidate, Jakaya Kikwete.

"But I'm not Going to do it. While the premier league starts, the oldest player, Ugandan, Emmanuel Okwi has been one of the most useful viewers. Did Yanga have gone to 'a enge' in his registration?. This could be a question that his answers are clear. First, Okwi is the Etoile du Salehe, the Tunisian player who bought him from Simba team. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Why is Yanga?. He was playing for SC Villa of their home in Uganda for a loan agreement of six months from Etoile. Narre again, he was playing for Villa on loan. FIFA allowed Okwi to play in Villa for a while in three cases that allows the Ugandan to be impressed with you. Okwi on his side claims that the Tunisians broke the contract by failing to pay his money as it is needed. Simba also demand their payment from Etoile. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Okwi was allowed to play for Villa in order to protect his level, and he was not a player he will face with that team. He was blocked to play for the national team of Uganda in the ongoing African Nations tournament for the players of the internal league, CHAN, because he was Villa on loan from overseas teams. Though, it is Villa that is the ones who are said to sell Okwi for Yanga team. With what authority?. Up here, Yanga will have been arrested. Because Okwi is the Etoile player is not Villa. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Yanga have signed Okwi claiming that they are right. They believe Okwi is a free player or the Villa. Though, he was supposed to play in Villa for six months, but he spent less than two months and was bought. CAF, Confederation of African Football have arrested Okwi to play for Yanga. The committee of law and status of the players has blocked its use until when they get a clarification from FIFA, the Federation of soccer in the world. Yes, they are right because FIFA, yes, who said that player will play the Villa for six months while his cases were dealing with. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. FIFA, they can allow Okwi to play for Yanga for his talent. Though, they can also block him if they know that this player has violated their previous instructions which they told him to eze Villa. It is possible that the player was seen taped, by punching Yanga when knowing that his contract is in Etoile. There are players who won the war like Okwi, but there are also those who joined the FIFA rubble. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Perhaps Yanga has accused Okwi using Okwi on the front days, but for now it is the validity of that player. If, Etoile will continue to hold their stand that they don't know their player wherever he is, Okwi will face it. If Okwi will be seen as legitimate claims he can be paid by Etoile, but the trouble is where Villa got a permit to sell Okwi for Yanga team? "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Each other side has its lawyers. Oh!. But Okwi's lawyer can be a little more, with a lot of mind, by being able to get signed by Yanga's radio for his explanation while campaigning for his client that he does not have a problem. If the law was put to end, and if the contracts all the days can improve, Yanga will use Okwi, but we should not be surprised by FIFA, saying that the player's assets of Etoile. Yanga bought where Emmanuel Okwi? Maybe here is a basic argument. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_26151133 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Christianity is surprised by Van Persie, you'll see Kiprotich Aug 22, 2012 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The big news of the games last week, was the issue of transfer of a player Robin Van Persie to Manchester United from Arsenal. The media have written that the salary of that player for a week will be about 500 million shillings in Tanzania. 'It's a lot of money, most of them. However, in a neighboring country of us, Uganda, our colleague has been rich because of a one-day job. Called Stephen Kiprotich, the National scientist who won gold medals in the Marathon race of the Olympic championships this year. Until yesterday, I hear that he had been contributed by stakeholders and various companies an amount of approximately 500 million shillings in Tanzania. In short, the amount that Van Persie will take a sweat in the whole week, Kiprotich has got it for one day. Again, he was just running away. She is ganged. She is "unbeaten" by fans and more, he has got the money serving his nation and not a club where it is working is not in love but simply for livelihood. Next week, Van Persie will take over 500 million shillings. Kiprotich will have to ASUBIRI to other competitions. If he succeeded, already President Yoweri Museveni has promised that his government will be giving 400,000 dollars to every player who will bring development to his country in a big tournament. The point that I want to protect you today is that there is a lot of money in the sports sector like each one of us implementing its responsibilities. If our nation has ended up in the Olympic championships, the reasons for failing that cannot be Filbert Bayi or the National Olympic Committee (TOC) only. That cause cannot be Selemani Nyambui and the Athletics Association of Tanzania. The reason cannot Makore a poet with the Tanzania Boxing Federation. Even our media is also part of the problem. I do not believe in Tanzania to miss one writer in the Olympic championships that took place in London, England this year. Even if Tanzania had only seven athletes in the tournament, it was still at least one vessel to report what is going on and can also learn why Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda have left away from games while they were behind our past. Our media remain online. And that's why, I was surprised that one day the journalist asked the question Bayi a question that why the team is doing in Kibaha in summer when Britain is cold. It showed clear that the writer, again a great writer, did not know that this is during the summer in Europe and that is even the Olympic tournament was recognized as the summer Olympics. But, if the writer has never been travelling or not taken to the competition, will they identify these things? This is the geography but it is a must to be better. Today, our media does not report about the money he is in Kiprotich. The way he was sleeping and woke up rich because of doing well in athletics. Youths who want to be athletes are inspired by the success of Kiprotich. The fact that contributions for this scientist was created and driven by the Ugandan government newspaper of New Vision. I haven't seen our media reporting that this year, a scientist who brought a lot of money in the world is the Jamaica artist, Usain Bolt. That until he died last year, Kenyan blogger, Samuel Wanjiru, had already got a gift of more than one million and a half dollars (approximately two and a half billion shillings), in a period of three years! All of us are talking about big salaries of the only ones. We forget that people can be angry for playing many other games. Manny Pacquiao (Pacman) has changed the street that he left in Manila, Philipines, because of the money he got in the boxing game. It is impossible that Tanzania has threatened athletes. This is a nation that has created high level athletes such as Bayi, Nyambui, Titus Simba, Habib Kinyogoli, Mwinga Mwanjala, Nzaeli Kyomo and others. I have faith that are there, so many. The problem is that we all want to criticize or we would like to be in the blame position but not to take appropriate measures. Our government is threatening to give a flag when the team wants to leave the gains. Uganda have promised to give 600 million shillings for every medal. We are just a flag! It is a must for the government to appreciate and make enough investment in sports. It is a must that all the games that can be played here in the country to be played by children to stop. Three weeks ago, Uganda has got its first champion in the Chess game since it got Uhuru. Who plays for Chess here in Tanzania? Anatoly Kasparov, a former champion in the World, made a lot of money because of the game only. We are here being cursed by Chess is not known. Our nation has remained only soccer. Every day soccer. Every week soccer. Every year soccer. We cannot go to this way but it is a must for the government to take appropriate measures to keep the same sector. When we got the protich, Bolt, Wanjiru, and Pacman, our country will change. These wealthy people and the economy will go round. And those living because of the strength of the economy of these athletes, they will respect sports. Bayan is accused of everyone because of doing badly for our Nation. But, I request to ask, what is another person who uses a lot of time in promoting athletics here in Tanzania more? How does the government do to get better athletes? How do the media do to make people get more than soccer games? If the journalist doesn't know that this tournament is Summer Olympics, he will give you a normal boy to go to be a scientist? If Bayi and Nyambui argue as if they are the biggest sports problem here in the country, who would want to be a scientist? "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

I know you like to look at the ball on good television and it was shocked but sometimes... and makes it really a way to solve the problem? After all the years? Eniwei, I don't want to even think that, let me continue with it. And why is Ulimban and it's not Olympic. Or is it because we have us with us. I am not a scientist but really we can do a two-week practice so that we should let us do for two years? Our pot and sardines can compete with a special diet of athletes there? Or we see that the number of police officers will decide the number of medal. The officers! Don't have a lover. However, I was in the competition together with the details of the life of the players. I was surprised to see how they come out for succeeding. But after being punished, I think the problem is not only preparations. Even the way we look for people has no errors. One guy brought him a proposal that he wanted the boss to give him to the minister of walks and games. Since I was left alone at home, I got an opportunity to take it after reading and handouts. Let's give your thoughts here. Honorable Minister, after checking the participation of our athletes in Ulimbiki, I request to give my contribution of ideas on how to improve our participation and to ensure that our athletes go back with a medal instead of being alive. Again, Honorable Minister believe that it is easy. Look at what kind of games and ask ourselves if our people can't play this games. Give us candles. We do not have that kind of people? It's not that we are our traditional ethnic groups. When we get those champions in their home and give them lessons they can't get into Ulimbiki and from a medal? Here, there are water games. Competitions of using different types of churches. Mador and carriers. Our fishing experts do not tell us here? Can they go so far and it will be very small, if you give them modern hand, who will be able to compete with them? Targeting the target. Where are our soldiers where they are unable to get even one to target the target at the international level? Now the enemy smoking, want? This without forgetting running. Who has never seen Haile Gebreselassie? His hand has come up with a result of carrying his books when he fled to school. Now he became the world champion from that exercise. We have many children who are still running a kilometer up to school? Potting apart do not have books to carry but carry a brick, or firewood for the teachers. Here is no even one to compete with Kenyans and bloggers? This and do not forget the talents of our sisters. The day before yesterday I look at one on her head. The technique used is the same way to raise the weight in Ulimbiki. We cannot start a bucket competition until we find our champions to go there? And the youth that increase sacks in the buses or to carry the market, or who are smoking in the market, do not have the muscles to compete? Not finished Honorable Minister. These teenagers, and a bicycle carrying ten times of their own weight, given little training to compete in a bicycle race? You don't know that your ethnic group is to jump... now. And without forgetting that our aggression were discovered. I tell you Usain Bolt does not discriminate in front of these. Even before not standing for those who have finished the race. He will not have no reason to save it again and he will be a model for the aggression. They are in the love of sports and the construction of a nation Basi, I found this mind because I loved his thoughts, then I went back to the bathroom. Again I heard the boss's car, however, I had to run as Bolt so that the letter should stop before he was confiscated. And you know the boss did? He stopped his eyes and then aked it up and bowled. "Pumbaf! Who will work to look for these if they are not given all the allowances for finishing all the money provided for sports? Who is ready to leave the tradition of "our white football games" and bring in our homosexual behavior in the national competitions. The gentle. The lifting of buckets. Competition from the canoe. Competition for winding and so on. Wants tweets? Other people sir. Photograph: Let's put my memories! " Then even when the guy came back to know the fate of his letter, the boss told him to go to the ministry of the walk then he described the boss as he broke up until he was buried. But how do you have a lover? She has no good idea. The problem is that we don't appreciate our people. We're still struggling with the people of another country then saying we are the poor country that is why... what poverty is we have the rich people? That is every day we ignore the human resources, and to value the resources that is why the number of officers are competing in the number of players themselves. But it is also in all our plans. In the villages who appreciate the villager's ideas? We have seen many plans as many as you are coming back to us because they are coming up with them without knowing that the fool of our environment is ourselves? Please even the Bible because the orders were ten, those who have a command, and the project is devastating us, we don't know what we don't know. Destroy it. Otherwise, if we cannot identify good people for the Ulimbos, then we should start our country and the games we know us different from that of the world. I suggest the following competition: The laundering. The one who snatched more quickly gets a medal. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The opposition for a long time during the parliament. And also, the ability to give a speech for a long time. Without forgetting our village colleagues and the youth. The ability to sit in half a brick without being intimidated. The ability to spend a piece of centuries. I know things like that can be enough for viewers but potentially. We will get our Heroes.

Reminding me so that not to forget. Asking for more knowledge. To take it more so as to fill the treasure of knowledge, skills and techniques. Seeking to remain professional. December 2016 was a month to help or enable the Citizen Communications Limited (MCL) to prepare for a lot of work and better for the year 2017. This time, that led the preparation of the journalists was MCL Relations Manager. In the middle of December, before many don't have to go to "eat the holiday," he tweeted and handed over to every writer. It was this: You received a writing. Sign a sign that has got. You leave it. You need to read carefully and use its content to prepare news by considering the criteria and conditions. Write this is a list of instructions, and at the same time, the criteria for testing the work of the writer to write and edit what he wants to be a news. This list is important to the writer. He can use asking questions, research and react. It is this list which the relations manager of MCL, refused to journalists so that everyone should have the same instructions about finding information and respect them so that they can be news. Given instructions and evaluation during the last holidays and the beginning of the year; they aim to tell the journalists not to forget them in celebration and forget them; but remain at work, imagination and testing their minds and their hands. Let's look at the list they were given to the journalists. Here he will not follow the flow of numbers. We shall go through punch. Andry wants a writer to ask whether the reports have come with weight and the value of being the news. Not enough, then continue to collect information and organizing the news. What the writer has written and it's called, it is answering all important questions - what is happening or has happened, about who or what, where, where and why? Andlive wants you to show the importance of what you write and give answers to the high profile questions; for example, about the main characters, who benefit, the poor benefit from what they report. The writer is supposed to ensure that what he has written in a special context and its history is understandable so that the readers can be able to unite the events even to predicted the following. All of this involve the writer and journalism. If there is a place where the writer is not putting it; then do not specify it or give me a writer to me; or not to wait for the recovery of the necessary information to make it news. The list of instructions and criteria is asking if it has shown all the information to prove what you write; it is asking if it has shown a list of the sources of information - people or control and if you have struggled to ask the perpetrators or all stakeholders in the issue that they reported. For many years there has been a problem of journalists to say and believe that there are two sides in everything; every issue. This is not true. Neither is there four sides "like the world." Each issue has a lot of sides as it is looking for the information he produces. The husband was in trouble with his wife, not only those involved in the fight. There is a neighbor who decided; the wanjia who witnessed the fight started; a child who remember the fight started yesterday or the day before yesterday; a delegate who remembers him in front of him in the street office and one of them broke the offense; the neighbors who go to sleep with noise-related noise. It is not enough to ask two people and put in the pocket that the work is over. There are many sides. The list of instructions and criteria that are celebrating daily, is one of the guidelines for the media that are under Nation Media Group (NMG) including MC. Stay away: You have mentioned other sources of information so that you write to be misunderstood? How have you put your story to a special audience and it is not a jumper?

He said there are some drivers and conductors of the buses have had a habit of filling passengers to continue the number of seats, a situation that contributes to passengers to miss their rights by failing to be paid for compensation. "So that the passengers can be paid compensation and the insurance company when it comes to road accidents, it is a must the owner of the vessel to give a report to the insurance company that he got in his bus within 24 to 48 hours and more than that, the right will be lost, therefore the passengers failed to be paid compensation and insurance and that responsibility remained with a person," he said. He said because Sumatran CCC is the vessel with the responsibility of defending the buses, it should be understood that the law is not allowed the owner, the driver or the conductor to stop the passengers on the bus and who will take a legal action to be eaten against him. In addition, he said the road safety law that is used is for a long time since 1973, therefore, there is a need for the government to be using the appeal so that it can go hand in line with the current situation in line with enabling them to punish passengers who will be found in the bus, the owner will allow his car to stop passengers and the driver and the conductor who will be in that bus.

It will be a budget that makes the previous budget before President Kikwete to leave power according to the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania. But this will also be the second budget for the second term of President Kikwete. In all the past six budgets, as usual, they have been successful and it can be explained to have been contributed to the weaknesses that have emerged in the management of those budgets. It is possible, the weaknesses or stability in the previous budget has been contributed in a certain way by ministers of the concerned funds or even some of the government officials and sponsors of the budget. It is our expectations that, the vulnerability in the past six budget will be used as a class to learn and strengthen the seventh budget which will be the first budget for the new finance minister, Doctor. William Mgimwa But on the other hand, the strength of the previous budget in some areas of implementation will be used as a criterion to continue improving this budget. It is our expectations, this budget will give solutions to many non-economic problems in the country. It is our expectations, the budget that will promote new revenue sources and will reduce tax exemptions too. The biggest one is that, we hope that this budget will put strategies to control the inflation of important products in the country. Meaning, it will be a budget for the citizens. On the other hand, we expect this budget to focus on the advice of the executive council of the Revolutionary Party (CCM) wanting the value added tax (VAT) to be withdrawn from food. Furthermore, we hope the budget will focus on another advice with the interests of the nation from other political parties and other private institutions in the country. Basically, we are expecting a budget with satisfactory answers about the problems that make the economy of our country. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

The invitation was born or Uyole, 03, as explained professionally, it is a type of beans in Mbeya province, but to the citizens of Lsupported village in Mbozi district, it is a name that is treated for livestock and even their houses to live. The wave of the villagers to give livestock and their houses the name of that type of beans are coming from some of them buying cows or building houses due to the money they got after selling those beans. The popularity of the beans, the type of beans has emerged as a sudden after the recovery of a reliable market in South Africa where the farmers of the French county through their groups have gone into a contract with one company from that country that requires the beans. The needs of the company from South Africa is 5,000 tons of beans for the year and according to the chairman of the Association of Cooperatives (AMCOS) of that village, those needs have resulted from the company being given a tender with their government to feed the school in that country. The market of the beans has been found through a special program to connect farmers and markets of beans and maize which is known in short of Sapphire. Sapphire is one of the programs that are implemented under the project of developing maize and Maharage using a way that does not involve the soil and markets in Mbeya Region, being implemented through the sponsorship of the African Revolution (AGRA- Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa). The program which in English is known as "Intensifying maize and beans Production Through improved soil health and marketing in Mbeya Region," it is also involved with good farming for maize and beans, including the use of good seeds to the area, the correct use of input, time to climb and consider the position. According to the project manager, who is also a researcher from the Uyole Agricultural Research Institute (Uyole), Mmari William, the needs of that type of beans in South Africa, comes from its main reputation of not making acids. It is stated that the type of beans were taken to South Africa and Tanzania, who were working in mines in the country, to attract more citizens from there due to the reputation of the acids (acid) together with his good flavor. However, it was not easy for those farmers to accept to get into the farming of a contract with the aim of producing in large numbers of beans due to their experiences about agricultural production projects. The farmers still have memories of the crops like pivica, which they have been encouraged to grow in large numbers where there is a reliable market but it was not so. "The farmers agreed later, after the buyer gave 18 tons of seeds for the beans," says Mmari. The harvest of the beans in the month of March, this year was motivation to the farmers of that village of French as well as neighboring villages to enter with more strength in the farming of the beans, being after the buyer bought all the farmers who have been smoking a different money and it was before getting into the contract with the buyer. Joseph Mungai is adorned with one of the farmers who benefited through the farming of the beans, who also after completing the construction of his house has given the name of the beans, Mwasipenjele. The victim says he started the beans in December last year after he was convinced by the experts of that soil health project, and after hesitation tried to tried. "This year I have seen that the beans are business, they said that they have its market and actually I got the market," says the farmer then adds; "you are behind the market was Mlowo, and you will meet with it there is that, I have got a lot of that day then it is 5,000 shillings for a plastic bucket of 20 kilograms." The farmer notes that the price that they agreed with the buyer from South Africa is 800 shillings for kilograms, thus in the capacity of a plastic bucket from the market in that district, it means he is leaving 16,000 shillings again without the cost of transportation instead of 5,000 shillings while being forced to travel more than twenty kilometers to follow the market. "This time, I have attracted me, the guys who follow him here," he is adorned with the analysis of the use of the money he had received due to the sale of beans saying, "I have finished my house that you see here, I have bought for a child and the rest of 101,300 shillings we used for local use."

The first day all of these people in the farm that they were farmers now have left agriculture, they have called the two-day bonanza no these are people who were chatting also there where they came from where they came from where they came from.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_90126881 Simba "yalia" and the referee "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Written by Vicky Kimaro "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Published: 03 October 2016 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The leadership of Simba Club today is expected to officially submit his complaints to the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) and the League Board (TLB) in order to make the referee for their match against Yanga, Martin Saanya. Simba and Yanga met at the National Stadium at the end of the week and drew 1-1 in the match that was full of violence. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The violence emerged from the leading goal of Yanga that was scored by Amisi Tambwe, which was reported because before he scored, the player wondered the ball with the hand that caused the violence to the fans of Simba because earlier Ibrahim Ajibu scored against Simba the goal that was rejected by the referee for claims he had lost. The fans went far from holding the chairs of the stadium and shut down the pitch. "With great sadness the Simba club has been very disappointed by the actions made by some of our fans to break the section of the National Stadium, an act that happened yesterday (the day before yesterday) in our premier league game against Yanga team..." We believe the evil actions made by our fans were caused by the decision that was caused by those referees especially Martin Saanya, "said Manara. "It was unclear how the referee used to accept the 'ball of the ring' of Yanga striker, Amisi Tambwe and refused the legitimate goal of our striker Ibrahim Ajibu. In that game the big violence broke out and caused the police to use extra strength by using bombs to stop the violence that some people were hurt. Moreover, Manara has apologized for the action of their fans to throw chairs and said they will communicate with the concerned authorities to pay them. "We apologize for this case and the club has agreed to pay for the cost of this destruction. The club will talk with the owners of this stadium to see how they get those costs, I hope that this will not come out again. " "However, we have already been surprised by the action of giving a red card to our captain, Jonas Mkude, this situation as the captain followed him to go to him who complained to his action of accepting the 'dirty' goal of Tambwe and all of us have seen Saanya was taking the while he returns behind and falling, and then got up and gave a red card to Mkude..." we believe this time TFF and the league board will give a stern warning to these referees to be a lesson for the wrong decisions of this type. "Also the club has complained about the action of our rooms for changing clothes that were given drugs that had the intention to affect our players before the match started, we requested the authorities to make a thorough investigation to determine this act that is not certain that is believed to be done by our opponents. "We know their mission is to make our players butoke, but our team of scientists took the right steps to make our players be able to finish the ninety minutes of the game with the ability and professionalism," he said. That is the second match to referee Saanya being reported by the goal of that kind which last season in the FA match between Yanga and Coast Union that took place at the Mkwakwani Tanga Stadium and Yanga won 2-1, the game broke down after the heavy chaos broke. In that game, Saanya was forced to break the game after Yanga's goalkeeper Deogratius Munish (Dida), being attacked by Coast fans while defender Oscar Joshua was beaten by bottles at the head. In that game, Tambwe entered the position of Donald Ngoma gave Yanga the second goal in the Simba's goal of the day before yesterday and Coast to complain about that goal being of support.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_38858000 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. National debate on death penalty "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Written by Lucy Lyatuire "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Published: 24 October 2016 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Last week, the Legal and Human Rights Center (LHRC) organized a forum for the purpose of discussing the existence of the death penalty in the country, it wants to be abolished and ended on claims that it is against human rights as the constitution explains the existence of the right to live. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. In that conference, it brought together various stakeholders for the purpose of discussing and expressing their thoughts on the presence of that punishment in the country and its importance. LHRC says, the right to live is the most basic right and the existence of death penalty is the right example of the violation of that right to live. Speaking at the conference, which was part of the commemorations to protest the punishment, the Director of LHRC, Doctor Hellen Kijo Bisimba, says the right to live is protected under Article 14 of the constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania of the year 1977, however, their defense and the constitution is not right. The death penalty in the country could affect anyone who will be found guilty of treason under the 39 and 197 provisions of the law of punishment and so as to be implemented in that punishment, it is until the President has signed a certificate of implementation of the punishment given by the court. The constitution gives the right protection of living under Article 14 but has also been a defense of non-humanitarian punishment, brutal and intolerance under Article 13 (6) (e). The death penalty is violating the right to live, a way for the execution of the punishment by hanging is a brutal, non-humanitarian situation and it is capable of humanity. Moreover, that station is believed that the punishment is conflicting with the constitution of the country by anti-article 14 which provides broader protection against the death penalty, but it is 20 years where the punishment has not been implemented here in the country. Apart from that LHRC offers reasons for wanting that punishment to be in the country, it reached the time of the existence of a national debate on its presence and implementation of that punishment so that both sides can be revealed in legitimacy. I am saying that because in the conference organized by LHRC, the sides agreed to continue the existence of that punishment, they went further to be even in religious books they produce the opportunity to be implemented in that punishment for everyone who is faced with that kind of crime. For example, the Islamic religion explains that some of the faces in the holy book of the Quran, the death is the right to a person who killed him for manslaughter, his right to deny him is not okay. Furthermore, the other hand explained that continuing to implement the law and when the death penalty will be taken to ensure it is implemented. It is due to the existence of the situation to have the importance of the existence of a national debate which you will be able to ensure that you finish the issue of death penalty and every side will be able to give them to the community, there are people who do brutal incidents to the extent that the punishment is legitimate for them. It's on that logic, to be reached when various civil society organizations, to use their time by educating the community to avoid making mistakes that in one way can help them reach a place to face the death penalty. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

Mi have the kids reading and there are some who are also present at the moment the donation gets in that we know. Twitter lt; hes tgt; also as initially said or first, I don't know where it has given birth to another business, it is Home I don't know where the farm is a long time. That if you are doing business will be able to sell another business for you business to respect it now. Of course, things are encouraging, he will be a person who is wondering what is making any way because the only reason is it. In every successful sister I didn't think there are challenges in different ways But when I see it seems if you have all the challenges that we meet are there. There are nothing like you said the achievements that do not have challenges, although at a little level Let's tell me the challenges that he met with the challenges that you meet there are local farmers who die still young. As I was yet to be given, it is still a bit traumatic in the crossing. It's because they need great temperatures But with needing temperatures when you do not be careful you can find. There was maybe that you have benefited or summer has become a small window, they will die with another challenge that is facing, it remains a solution is that my production has been young because I don't have a machine of not given up to their home, but they don't have to go more than five hundred feet. Ehler is a little Little bit. So when I get the machine I believe that the challenge I will be finished now Because sometimes the old and eggs want to offer you to vote for someone who has organizations for a car in the morning from next week, we have to do what the reproductive eggs should be used We would like to know that and I think a big level of rearing is so much about the challenge, one of the people you have is to get the machine of given priority. There is what you do with that machine right now and he will be hoped if I hoped to create a very good machine that I will do with it for a while it is very clear that we continue with my work, Isaiah's trauma, so it is still a friend to get a good machine and we have been shown in some of those programs that do not benefit from those services and its support is very close to we are happy to speak up to identify them so that they can help. Ohh apart from that challenge, there are a lot of challenges I look for okay every person is not there is no big challenge than the comfort because because they choose. They don't have accommodation, if you will suffer from dying in there and something like that, where the medicine needs to really need medicine. But just by saying that, I request you to give a note to the viewers because we have been told that someone is telling you that he needs medicine then they are going to get the way he can. Maybe he may be no social welfare not to take it well, they will decide to use Twitter lt; hes' gt; I didn't say that for those drugs then I'll find out what I can find. The love of Fid Q in the state of dirt will be you have got a lot of cuts that will find themselves as a new thing, they should not be taught that it will be cleaned well as the way to rear those with other bags, you should be suffering but if you go for a cleanup when they don't need any medicine if you remove the responsibilities and even if you don't need it, but we are looking for a lot of medicine for you if you need to forgive you because they need a few but if you look at a normal state since they are required. When it remains a young man so as to bring strength that led to water only and I'm out of a little to get a force then we will end three days they don't need any medicine and they are very fast because it is milk and entertaining about seven years we have been looking for the eggs when all eight weeks have confusing the beloved country. I desire that starting to hear the news of the money that come and those using food are using food to MAS like food for chicken, they are using the toilet that has also been shared more than the big ones who don't want to be messy because their little is small that food that is good. So much so he can't hear but the pain we have bought it, you are bought by AHH food often is the tradition of myself and my family actually make you take a machine or you go to the machine, I tell me I don't know it. Congratulations again And now sister Suzan true Pina ask us to talk about money You know that there are small business entrepreneurs in the seated are waiting because they are delaying them.

So after that I was surprised when I was surprised at the market when I remember the ones I was giving them a lot of hope to see the changes he announced now. So now the market has become so high that even I can't. Completely, you know we are now telling me on Monday as I start reminding the construction I want to breed that we are together but Now if you look at the price in the eggs of kwale people that sell between one thousand shillings directly to one hundred and five hundred thousand shillings for the purpose of the border to come up to the years and while it sucks it to make sure that it is a hundred of seven reasons.

Our country is in sadness of the conflict between doctors and the government. It is the sorrow and worry. Suluhu's fighting has not been found. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. It is sad, because, this is our country, they read it is our doctors and that is criticized is our government. It is the citizens of this country who are concerned and even lost their lives due to this strike. This is very sad. It is something that supports our country. Behind there, we insisted, and here I started to insist on my stand as a Tanzanian who loves my country, that there is no other way to end this conflict but it is through a brotherly relationship and friendly talks. The characters have to sit on the table as a tweet and recipe for this crisis for the benefit of our country and its People. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. For now, every side you see a colleague is the one who is wrong. Therefore, each side has run handles and develop a "war of fighting." The truth, in the war, there will be no winner, because, as a nation, we all have failed. And we continue to fail More, because our People are dying for lack of reliable treatment. Basically the claims of doctors is basic and that's not about. And the government's concerns are fundamental and that will talk about. Therefore, both sides can talk to the right direction. It is not a wisdom for now for doctors to continue with their strike when the doors of the conversation has not been given a bronze medal, and not wisdom as well as the government "to boycott" talk to doctors on the pretext that the issue is in court. I join religious leaders who urged the government to cancel the case and strengthen this case at the table of talks. It is good and it is wise now for doctors to announce, for the benefit of our country, to postpone their strike immediately and go back to work to serve the customers with all heart. They do that even in the difficult environment they have, while the efforts to reach the right time and the government continues. I mean, any strike is a loss. Every day that goes with the strike means a loss to the country and its people. He's a loss of money and survival. That is why all the two sides are supposed to ensure they meet and find solutions to fighting hands. And in this twist, if there will be a situation of disagreement between the government and doctors, then, the Association of doctors to start now think the good way to run strikes different from this current. For instance, in accusing the government we could not have a strike to one hospital and not the whole country. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. It can also not be for a whole hospital but several units while services in other units continue. However, it could defend the disturbance and reach the government to discuss with doctors in improving their interests. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. But this is "Wild strike" because of the nationwide strike has a "health risk" to the nation. Let it reach a place to contribute to our own country to go through cracking on strikes. I have been able to write, that it is true, to be almost every Tanzanian who woke up in the morning, or it is a patient or he has relatives, relatives or a patient. Therefore, there are millions of people from Tanzania with different kinds of diseases. It is a Tanzanian who depend on the medical services that are given by our doctors. And in our countries, the doctor is a very important friend of a citizen. It is a very bad thing, when the government comes to conflict with doctors. If you go to the conflict with the friends of the citizens. There is no place anywhere in the world, the citizens came out to hate doctors. Therefore, it is a tragedy when the government is unable to finish his differences with the citizens of the citizens through the way of talks and even reach the point of doctors who refused. In our countries, the medical surgeon who was shown to the money of paying taxes and for many years is needed. Assistant medical officer is needed. And even if he was to be the assistant physician of the medical officer, he would be much needed. Similarly, the midwives and assistants, senior nurses and their assistants. They are all needed. In our countries, the government should not supposed to reach a step to threaten and even fire the doctors. That's an end to happen only when all other ways of finishing different ways to resolve conflicts and doctors will have been denied. And why are competed for? Well, all of Tanzania would like to see this fight between the government and the doctors to be resolved quickly for the search of hands. Nash again, the biggest for now, is for both sides in this conflict to recognize that for now the tension is going on will not give a winner, it is because, in what happened and what is happening right now, all of us, as a nation, we have failed. This is time to put it wise and wisdom. We should do all, but, the Arabs of the Arabs of the conflict is now a conversation in the atmosphere of torture, then. God bless Tanzania, God bless Africa.

He said, "for now the area is being attacked by citizens and that situation can cause an investor to give up." It is stated that the investor has shown good intentions to build houses for teachers and servants in the health sector, therefore it is good that the area is measured by having documents. He said that yesterday after Gambo visited the clinic area and saw the real situation of infrastructure, including the way the investor has sacrificed for the purpose of helping the hospital services together with the construction of houses for teachers and modern nurses. He said that in that health center, he is expecting to bring a machine to shine and that the existing challenges are lack of electricity. He asked Gambo to help them so that the electricity will go to that center and eventually the citizens can benefit from investors because some of the tourists are at the center to see how citizens get treatment. On his part, Gambo congratulated Chambulo in helping the community as an investor in tourism and ordered the lands officer of Longido district together with his fellow experts to arrive at the area on Monday so that they were ime.

Many areas of Dar es Salaam for now is not safe to live. It is not safe because criminal acts conducted by various criminal groups are growing significantly. The week does not live without hearing incidents of robbery in the areas of Dar es Salaam. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Those actions have done people to live in fear because there is no incident that the police have tried to catch up or even stop it before. Apart from that robbery using fire weapons, but there are also groups driven by mouse Road, Wolves and Black Americans and many others have been a big threat to the residents of Dar es Salaam as a result of doing criminal acts without even having any fear against the state agencies. Since May this year, these groups use traditional weapons like gays, machetes and knives have been a big threat in the areas of the outskirts of Dar es Salaam and despite the looting, they have also attacked people who are attacked by swords and knives. An example of the day before yesterday in Mbagala, it was reported that one of those groups made a Little one of the officers of the Defence Force (TPDF), Jerald Malilo who got serious injuries in the head and forced to be admitted at Lugalo Army Hospital. Malilo was injured while entertaining at work during the morning, despite the soldier but also many citizens have already discovered that one way of getting income is to make the people who have ever worked early in the morning. The day before yesterday in Dar es Salaam, such groups stormed people's homes and killed two people and made looting. Such events when police arrive in these areas have already been killed or injured badly and looting have been done. But there are other groups that are running the looting at night in different areas. These have been stormed even in bars for the project to get anything to believe that people who go to bars are those who have money. There are also other groups doing their crime at night, they feel that most of them wear people's homes. They are searching for homeless people may be interested in getting any amount of money, mobile phones, non-cell phones and laptop computers. These youth groups have already confessed because they are doing looting or invading people's homes, the behavior of the people of Dar es Salaam for fear of giving support they have contributed to the groups to be good. But also the lack of security including one of the community police in many areas have encouraged those youths to do their crime for more freedom. Many areas of the city of Dar es Salaam have no police stations and for example residents of Dar claim that the police service is available at the Stuari station which is far from that area. My advice is that the area like Kitunda, which has more than two wards, that is Kitunda Ward in Dar es Salaam and Msepwa is good for the police to be in custody for 24 hours than it is now in Kitunda Ward being supported at 4 o'clock in the evening. This is dangerous and provides an opportunity for these groups to do their crime for more freedom. Even other areas outside the city like Mbweni and it does not have a police station depending on the idea, something that is very dangerous. In the previous years, the community seemed to help a lot in strengthening defense. The chairmanship will be present at that time, Said Mwema, by recognizing the least the police seemed to afford that area and the crime has significantly reduced. But the departure of IGP Mwema should be like he left with participatory security. I suggest that controlling these criminal groups must be a stable security. The police are interested in participatory security in our neighborhoods so as to get people to cooperate with the police in making security of citizens. "But I'm not Going to do it.

Now that is the minister or secretary in the ministry of health Doctor Mpoki Ulisubisya Speaking about the issue and how the government of President Kohn alcohol Magufuli It is dealing with last year the Sea of medicine in Tanzania is known as Hemed. It was reported by various media outlets in the country to stop the delivery of drugs Which is important for the government's health institutions until when the debt of ninety billion shillings would be paid by those institutions but the spokesperson of the Sea of medicine in that country, Etty Kusiluka Holding that despite the complaints of lack of medicine, it has enough medicine, Etty Kusiluka lets tell us now this lack in some of the hospital centers continues to be talked about? Medicine is not a hospital not to end the medicine no medicine Medical stores, there are drugs that have started to enter and requested the medical stations when they start asking the video And how long will it take to all hospitals and institutions require A three-day job to buy medicine to protect and distribute for helosi are spreading drugs due to the application that they voted for. The request for all the hospitals that have brought in prayers Going on the drugs that are being spread and taken to those in the world We have been rumors that if one year passed, it said that those who maybe have not paid. The money that they were. They are supposed to pay they will not get those drugs, there is a fact that those rumors are being waited is to ensure that a Tanzanian citizen gets treatment and that is why even if you hear those who had no weapons were given medicine for the exercise and take medicine to them. It continues as usual, other issues of paying debts that I have left us we are doing with communication They pay those minerals from the time and when they get the money who say that they do not get medicine, maybe it is just a time but this issue will be opened here recently when you go to the concerned hospital, there is no medicine to ask where the area also requested and asked them that they gave them drugs. Unless otherwise If it has been forced to see how it is to see how it gets to us when it comes to it. Hospital lack of medicine does not mean that in a medical store there is no medicine where the government or those hospitals have no money to bring some medicine to be given by the minister maybe the situation is now. At war if a hospital doesn't make medicine has continued every government's health center and government hospitals. Which has continued to get money from the hospital where the university is being viewed as their accounts have money then given medicine but not that they are giving money to be buried about getting drugs that happens is that the government's budget and isolation and put on their accounts were given to jail but they also have other income sources that they can add to where it comes to. The other revenue, which include the spot-spot of the prosecutors. Basket Fund things like that they can add to where they feel that they have more medicine needs but hospitals like hospitals do not Direct to buy medicine has increased more than using money that are defended by the government So the money that they are getting extra which from other revenue sources can come to them and buy additional drugs We continue to give medicine to drugs not to bring that their accounts did not like enough. That is why I tell you that we are looking at more. Health, a citizen's health is not the same as something else or food or something that is health that is why even the people complaining, we need to live together and that even his account if a small number we wait but other things get missing, maybe therefore you are being called an unprecedented person and he is gay you to tell you go your account doesn't have money not to do so.

Before continuing to write what I intended to apologise to the girl who introduced himself by the name of Mercy on her. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. According to Mercy, his lover has given birth to his mother (mother of that girl). Mercy also has the pregnancy of the boy. The mother of Mercy has admitted that he has pregnant he was given by "her in-law." It is not normal in our community but that's the real situation, the guys "chewing up" mother and child. What happened to Mercy confirms that, the one that you love and believe him is the one who is able to thank him, to hurt and even destroy it. After that, I congratulate the parents of the child Rashed Al- Hajjawi (10) of Palestine by recognizing the talent of that child and develop it. I congratulate you because it is not many parents especially Tanzania who are doing efforts to recognize their children's talents, and some are aware but there is no effort to promote them. The child Rashed has the talent of playing soccer to an amount of being given the name of Messi of Palestine. That child has been born in Norway in the year 2006. Lionel Messi is a soccer player of Argentina, and he has been the best player of the world five times. For what they saw the video showing the talent of Rashed without doubt that they have accepted the ability of that child to play soccer an amount of compared to Messi. In that video, Rashed was playing soccer with his colleagues, but nobody was able to block him. He adds that how she wants, he has a great ability to own the ball, attacking, he is playing and annoying, and the great ability to follow the goal. Juventus club has discovered the talent of that child and has already signed, so after several years he will start doing his in Seria A in Italy. Perhaps there are Tanzanian children with different talents but it is sad that parents including youths do not have a culture of mentioning and developing. Children's talent is a treasure to them and if they are continued to use them in the coming years to get the money that happened to Messi, they are coming from Christiano Ronaldo, Marta Vieira da Silva, scientist Usain Bolt, basketball player (retired) Michael Jordan and musician Janeth Jackson.

December 2, 2014 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The union of local governments (ALAT) in Tanga province has announced the conflict with the central government claiming that some of the district commissioners have been blocking the servants, elected officials using the authority that they have to put in custody. The chairman of ALAT in that province, fre.Sadick Kallaghe, said that the day before yesterday at the meeting of that community that took place in Muheza town, while on the resolution of their session that took place in Pangani District, September 22, 2013. He said they are not ready to see any leader of the Central Government is blocking local government servants. He added that the main government has distributing power to local governments as an illusion because most of the money in every year's budget that are taken to the council especially the funds for development, are coming in delay or not completely. "The result, citizens lack faith in the leaders of the council including politicians... there is no good relationship between the central government and local government here in Tanga. "Some of our staff are oppressed when they implement their work, it has reached a step even the councilors are placed inside but because the issue of the councilor of Mswaha Ward, Korogwe district, Tesu Kipaku is in court, we cannot speak," he said. He said the local government is the full authority that was made legal as the executive director, chairman of the council, heads of departments, councilors and other servants. Kallaghe who is also the chairman of Korogwe district council and the councilor of Dindira Ward, said that he is one of the people that were harassed from his district and some of the members of the parliamentary committees who visited that province in the year 2013 because some of them have their agenda "pocket." "In the sessions of the leaders of the council and parliamentary committees, reports that are provided are not true, the member of parliament is standing and said that the council of Korogwe has got dirty documents, he asked where he got these data, my council has never got a dirty documents five years in a row," said Kallaghe. He added that another thing that deprives local government leaders is the main government to announce to the citizens that "it has given" billions of money to the council while it is money for salaries for servants and those of development projects. Kallaghe said that more than three months, the main government has not taken money to the council for the purpose of normal expenditure (OC), funds for development projects more than four months and those of compensation for sources which were canceled (GPG). "Apart from these funds not being given, it is still announced that there are many funds have been taken to the council, and we are confusing the citizens," said Kallaghe. And the local government officer in that province, Maggie Chande said the local governments don't have a lot of money as claimed by the central government, thus they are unable to implement many development projects instead of the local government servants have been called and put inside. "The leader can lead people to disperse or gather, we must use wisdom because we don't rule the animals... I have noted that the leaders are elected at the age of this age is a problem, the old man is elected at the age of more than 35 years," said Chande. And the Deputy Mayor of Tanga City, Mzamil Shemexit said some of the leaders are being given power where to put inside a servant, the executive of the village or the chairperson does not eliminate the problems but increase since it is cold. 24 January this year, Mister. Kipaku was placed inside the order of the head of Korogwe district, Mister. Mrisho Gambo is alleged to have called for the general meeting of the village on January 21 and urged the farmers to go to burn the path, a cow of breeders on January 22 this year. As a result of that situation, Mister. Kipaku announced the resignation of that position claiming to be assaulted by Mister. Gambo. Speaking to summer, Mister. Gambo said that politicians contribute towards the conflicts of farmers sometimes they are presenting to the campaigns when they get power they will provide breeders in the areas of farmers.

Parandesi of this week has been forced by the head of words I was appointed for this week's post: OBSIZO. As I explained at the end of last week's article, I fail to get a Swahili word that will explain to the concept of western word "obscurantism" or "obscurantist." In fact, there are a lot of concept that we know every day that has not been given an appropriate words in our language, and this is one of those. In the situation we have, then, I would dare to say that it is fit, occasionally, we should join us, let us go, let us go, let's go with new words from other languages. Isn't it all the languages, as well as Swahili, where?))) A man who is described as obscurantist (obscurantist) is the one who thought that he is knowing and he went on to her all his strength, and he was ready to even go to war to defend his "skills". It is a person who believes the things that can have been called and at the time, and the knowledge of the show is being found, but he does not want to hear or see the whole thing that can lead to its ignorance. The community can also be jailed and shackled. In fact, it is a community that goes on anti-anti-anti-anti-corruption systems, because the society is building its religious system for a long time, and put the systematic and mistaken procedures, including law, regulations and traditions that make sure every community community is taking a knee in front of religious beliefs, often by fear to be punished. All of us have been born in the communities with several faith that marched and instructions together with the publication. We have developed communities in faith, law, regulations and procedures, basically without having an opportunity to question the need to do so. In this way, even those instructions that are beneficial, or the prospect of benefits, we follow and view them without knowing what we are doing so. Many African communities don't allow children to ask a lot of questions, especially if the questions have a direction to highlight the basis of common faith. When a child wants to know more than he needs to know that he is going, or he will be told it is a rude or a tooor, he does not respect the older, and so on. The result is that, in many sectors, we have built our communities on the basis of old faith that don't have gays in today's world, and it is not surprising that development we are like. Our communities don't allow analysts, and without analysts, there are no progress. I will go back to this before the journey. This situation has a relationship with issues that I have discussed for some time now, especially better education and health services to our people. In understanding the problem of obesity and how to deal with the issues of education and health happen directly. Even in the atmosphere of extreme poverty, in the thick darkness of ignorance and pain, arise in a few light of light that even the power of anti-anti-torture cannot shut down, despite the end of a certain time. Eventually, they collect and unite the strength and then be a composite with a tight light that is seen everywhere. That in the University of obilisation as this can come out and eventually having a non-intolerance is due to the great pressure of the agents of change (Agency of change). There is no agent of a greater change than education, true education that aims to break the shacery of obesity, distraumsy and the light of the human mind. In this sense, investment in good education is investment in the fight against racism. We can be conflicting until When they go back home about that called better education (and better we are fighting instead of the leaders pretending to know on our behalf), but you are several things that cannot accept a long debate. For example, for those relating to the debate we have now, it is impossible to "better education" was the one that makes them get to believe that there are people going through a helicopter from Songea to Tanga. A person who went through the school to university and got this degree or one, and he still believes that we have Tanzanian people who are creating a helicopter ravuits, that he has gone to school, but education has given him along.

Written by Ikunda Erick "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Published: 03 November 2016 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The transport services of buses to different provinces in the country has increased due to the needs of that service. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. However, the needs are supposed to be done by having travel agencies that meet the criteria of road safety. Due to the presence of the buses that are making a long and short journey, it is required to be a thorough inspection of those organs of the regular fire, so as to be satisfied with the ability of those agencies especially buses to carry passengers and travel especially long distances. For several years now, we have witnessed the increase in road accidents that are caused by the laziness of drivers or poor condition of the fire equipment, a situation that cost the nation by losing their strength and also to stop the families having orphaned children and those with disabilities. Despite the road safety laws, some of the drivers have been broken deliberately. In addition, in ensuring that those buses are traveling are safe, the audit authorities, including the Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA), is supposed to handle them in detail then they should be given the consent of making a journey. I believe that the inspection will enable the removal of buses that are going to a long way though they are capable of going to a short way, therefore, to avoid passengers and accidents or threats that can be found in the journal, for example the spoiling of vehicles every time and forcing them to go on the way. There are buses that have been allowed to travel for a long distance, for example from Arusha to Dar es Salaam which is a distance of 600 kilometers, yet his ability is to travel a few kilometers away. There are some of the buses that are traveling to various provinces while it seems clear that they don't have that ability, a situation that has caused us and caused some to ask ourselves if the authorities concerned with the inspection of quality and the ability of those buses are responsible as required. It does not mean that those buses do not have the ability to do any journey, certainly, they are attractive to the short journey, thus being required to be given permits for making those trips and not long as those of 600 kilometers or more. That is important, that's why I insist on a comprehensive inspection. Other buses outside have good colors but the ability to make the journey were allocated are not, due to them. It is clear that travelers using those buses get a lot of trouble especially when it comes to them, their lives to be at risk and their property is also in danger, because most of the damaged areas are not safe. It has been normal to see the passenger bus that is supposed to travel for two or three hours taking six hours, because of getting spoilt after a long distance. The situation reveals that other buses or not being treated well or should be approved and do a long walk to be endured. This is dangerous. I advise the buses that the passengers are making comprehensive inspection so that they are not required to make a long journey to be short. Let's go on to provide services to a distance that doesn't deserve is to endanger the lives of passengers for accidents that can be avoided. Traffic police are doing their work well, the passengers also have a good opportunity to inform the drivers who know their lives by driving badly and they also have the responsibility of giving information about the whole trend of the bus, including informing the concerned authorities about poor conditions of the buses that they use to travel if it will be damaged on their way. The aim is to convince the audit authorities to do well before they allow them to do a short or long journey. I would like to be understood that, the inspection of the ability and the keenness of the drivers only is not enough to be tickets for the safety of passengers on the journey, but even the quality of the buses itself should be assured.

Employee is supposed to avoid dangerous environment at work, we have seen many times some of the workers implementing their responsibilities, in a difficult environment. Therefore, an employee is implementing its responsibilities in the environment that tells the procedures while others don't know that their environment affects their health. Together with that, many workers listen to a certain person, who was working in the factory or the company died there is no even one of the workers who took action against the cause of that death. Employee should be an employee or a task, it is his right to know about some of the chemicals that are in the industry, which are killed by causing various effects of cancer. Most workers circulate and die before their age, by thinking that the right is a sin and by thinking that the value of their personality is low because of poverty or because of lack of education. Some of the employers think they have the right to reduce the value of its workers, so that they can get a financial well. Several workers in the country have lost links or their lives, matched because of the haze of mining in mines. These effects are not only workers, but even the residents around the mines. There is a large number of employees who today are working in a difficult environment that is going on. Many people are exposed to their employers in an environment that has been surrounded by poison without caring, because they want to get great benefits. Today you pass through some industries and even some of the bloggers here in the country, you will discover people they are being toxic or explicit in believing that they have a small value or bigger than other human beings. This is known that people work in that kind of environment, simply because of wanting money and believing that they will live a hard life and their families leave. Some industries often find workers in the Environment to protect themselves AT risk, such as equipment to prevent dirty weather, special shoes, work clothing or cap when it is where the leader is visiting the factory. Leaving workers are told to be lazy and continue with work as it is their traditions. The employee who accepts this environment is that he has not recognized and do not know his rights. The workers remember that the environment is slower and often you are lying because you don't know your wives fall and die suddenly at work. But when they hear a certain person who was working at work he died, and did not even ask about the death of a fellow worker that was caused by what. The workers are suffering from knowing that chemical, dust and many others in industries are killed by giving them a slower disease. It is very important for the workers to know this issue that in this world where more people are continuing to give up and worry more, understand their rights. Most importantly, most of them are paid small salaries that don't meet their needs. Therefore, it will not receive even immediately, some employers are overseeing the safety of their employees at a high level, because by doing so, they should use additional costs so as to reduce profits. It is about the employee himself asking him about his safety in work. If there are signs of small security, it is good for the employee to try to look for the ways of suicide and finding other activities. There is difficulty in getting employment or changing activities, but if there are many workers think their children and others who depend on them will be affected.

The way the parents we live with its impact on the values of children in the life of parents involve words, actions, behavior and traditions of the parents that are used in running their daily lives in their families and the community that surround them in general. The relationship between parents, neighbors, relatives, relatives and friends and how it gets to visitors, etc. It all affects the growth of children's behavior in two different sectors; positive impact and negative consequences. We all know children significantly learn from their parents. What they see is doing a parent, they also work. A variety of psychology and growth of the child describes the mazon as a family leader (role model). He should be an example to be followed by the children, I respect especially when he is in front of the children by doing good deeds that are supposed to be followed by the children and the beautiful communities that surround them. To pick the words to speak ahead of her children especially when he is angry. Children are not born and abusive and saying, they get from the communities around them. Everyday life, small acts and words create a reflection on the children on life, language and relationships... "your words are your actions, your actions, your behavior, your behavior and traditions are your life," is the quote of a philosopher and father of India's nation, Mafate Gandhi. As a result of the words of this philosopher, then behavior, traditions and actions are the real picture of human life that is seen in front of the eyes of other people and this is based on the upbringing of his child. The brain of a human being has been forced to receive and keep in all the records that you received. Economic experts say the youngest child has a lot of potential to receive information, protecting and remembering what he saw at ease than even the whole person and this is because the child is thinking about the only time that is different from the whole person who thinks the behavior and traditions of parents in three times: The next year. This one in mind is used to help confusion of various challenges in life. Unlike it appears to be taken, the child's upbringing is not limited to giving an important needs like food, accommodation, housing, clothing, education and health, but it involves themselves to build the foundation of life that will ensure that for now and later, he has said or did not read the parent has a great opportunity to implement this important role in the child's upbringing. Birth is not work, work to raise. They killed early our hearts. A rare legacy gets a child from a parent is how to live with the world. Therefore, the parent has a great responsibility of implementing this. Let us start to live as parents because there is a wind to forget, continue to chatting with your friends and your friends as they use violent words in the ears of children including arguing in front of children, in this way it will destroy the whole future of the growth of their children. It will cost a lot of time to impose disciplinary action against the children who were raised in this environment. These children don't have answers to adults and usually have discipline problems while in school. Their relationship with teachers are not good and often do not get close support from the teachers and the end they are unable to continue well.

In the general elections of the year 2010, the Revolutionary Party (CCM) lost Mbeya town region in the same environment that caused the province to fall in the NCCR-Evolution Party, in the general elections of many parties in the year 1995. Polisya has emerged the winner in the 1995 election after defeating the CCM candidate, late Bruno Mpangala, while Joseph Mbilinyi emerge the winner in the 2010 General Election. In all the two elections are members of CCM who contributed to their party, being the result of groups resulting from the candidates, where members have been divided while each one is defending its candidate. Among the reasons mentioned to contribute to the anger of the candidates in that party is together with personal interests, many benefit from candidates, therefore the action of their candidate not to vote in opinion polls are usually only one reason, stop using the eating that they got from their candidate. However, there is another reason, it is a step by some of the leaders to have their people thus demanding the adoption of the excluded candidates by voters, a step that they get affordable when the "injuries" those political leaders are rated to the second side, the opposition. Different names are mentioned to vie for that constituency through that party in the year, some include the writer of Business Times, Charles Mwakipesile, who in recent years has been close to the politics of that party in Mbeya region. However, Mwakipesile refused to confirm that saying the time to announce yet and that right now he has focused on working with the party. "The time still, I am doing the work of the party," says Mwakipesile, when he was required to speak to him in the list of those who showed the intention of vying for that constituency which is currently one of the main strongholds of CHADEMA in the country. The member who was in charge of three positions in that party, including the member of the general meeting of CCM - the nation representing Mbeya province, a member of the executive council of CCM Mbeya Region and member of the political committee of that party, in this province. Others are the former chairman of CHADEMA in Mbeya Rural district and the parliamentary candidate twice in Mbeya Rural constituency, Sambwee Shitambala. In all the two elections he also participated, he was on the right of the current member of parliament of CCM, Pastor Lackson Mwanjali. The failure twice for Shitambala, while CHADEMA is believed to have the strength in that constituency against CCM and their candidate, they have caused the division within that party, with some of its leaders and members who accused him openly that he was bought so that he will be bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he was bought so that he However, Shitambala said he is not ready to put his intention openly saying the time is not appropriate to do so, saying; "I have never announced, I am MNEC, is a party leader, I supervise the ethics of the party." In addition to confirming, the member says the right time comes to people to know if he will pray for or not, but he cannot stop the citizens not mentioning his name and it is possible because of them (citizens) to believe that he can. Shitambala right now is a member of the executive council of CCM Mbeya Town, after joining from CHADEMA where he fled from CHADEMA, claiming he is tired of racist politics on the basis of the party's regions. Among the open discrimination that are outlined by that leader is together with the issue of special seats and how his former party has stopped the youths who are using to announce that party in Mbeya Rural district. Shitambala notes that he was tired of being affected by the way women in that province were done, and the behavior of hooliganism, violence and distrust. "The groom lives in a group that is like, I wasn't in the group," notes Shitambala being the first time to talk in detail that gave CHADEMA. He will not talk about the position of his party in the next general elections, especially in Mbeya town region they lost after he was defeated by CHADEMA in the previous elections. "Basically CCM is the ones that voted for CHADEMA candidate, I know that that took place, more than 75 percent of the votes came out of CCM," notes Shitambala. The description of Shitambala confirms the claims that the presence of leaders and party members of the party to participate in opposing their party being the anger of their candidate being defeated in the referendum. His explanation get more strength due to the fact that during that time he was the leader of CHADEMA and also their candidate for Mbeya Rural Constituency, it is clear he understands a lot and he knows many who participated in the party in the 2010 elections.

He has not reached the level of success of going to join form five and six studies, he is deciding that because I have followed up in form five and six months I can go to the teaching college to learn so I can get the job because he becomes a call for that mi nasoma but I would like to write in this teaching call. And then This call for teachers Four Being misled by some of the people that teaching is a hard work, therefore it has maintained some of the people who are not involved in it. Twitter so that it has been their great job but the people who actually fall within their hearts as mi I need to go to be a very few teachers. I am asking only to say that teaching work is a call like other calls but only. People are changing yesterday that teaching is a job like any other job, even trying to make sure that they can get his own interests and instead it is not that she needs to teach the children not to do with the group of people who do not know how to read about this issue in preparation for the students who started working in the past eight years, you find a lot of books but it's really difficult to prepare for students who were registered to do a national exams again, I think that's why they are given a lot of work so that it is very difficult to prepare the students that were registered to do a national exams again, I think that's why they are being given. And we know what should be done for breakfast that the level of education is not enough. What I see the government needs Whether it should place it as give permission to a few people, So every writer is required to start his book as a book of textbooks is used to be introduced to the whole country. And it's not that every school has its own book which can use because we look at the exam, it is the whole nation they are doing one exam and you are not even though you are coming from a book so that some of the students who are due to the changing of those books, I have used another book of maybe Oct reports the exams are supported in the company Limited so that the government is required to look at all journalists who are involved in organizing a book of textbooks not to be used by something that is something that is not the whole then to be understood. I see it here for the government to create a environment that is a friend For A environment that is a friend to teachers and student For the purpose to be able to overcome this problem is good for the government as it is looking at The problem is there. The environment for example, I consider there are many primary schools in there, you find maybe the day has launched and the wind That, as the class remains open for a long time, the government has not been renovated when the students and when it comes to seven hours, it needs that in the period and fail to stay in the classroom, a student needs to go home. In order to be a mystery now in Tabora, what should be done? First thing The government Do not have a good plan about the education sector First thing Like there? Minister that is heard of power I must look at first in the past followed, I don't know how to change it for example now there is a procedure This afternoon up to seven hours their partners with hiding It does not bother him The student skills because what will happen if the calculations Now in the AHH we don't have the way it seems to be doing So the answer should be found not now they are told to be hiding in the answer the money is given, is a student who is credited when he gets to learn what and you have heard about the scholars who are alleged to be teachers here in the country and be able to pass it down here. This is now an opportunity for my analysis to you, you know what will happen to raise the level. For me I see her.

Users know about Britain's withdrawal of foreign ministers from the founders of the EU, France, Germany, Belgium, Italy and Holland in a Joint session yesterday in Berlin to discuss the legacy of the union after Britain withdrew. Picture: AFP This is the first time for a country member to withdraw from the union since the establishment of London, England. As the European nations continues to reflect on the decision of Britain to vote to withdraw from the union, there has been a few concerns that are controversial. The main concerns that are being discussed is about what is called critical questions which have begun to be buried in order to determine what could happen in the relationship between England and 27 countries that have been caught in that union. Now the European Union is in shock and it comes to an area that hasn't done. There is no member who has ever returned since the establishment of that union and section 50 of the European contract provides a few details. The following are some of the details about the ongoing incident in the world. What is the meaning of "Brexit" is short of words that mean the possibility of England to withdraw from within 28 countries that are members of the European Union (EU). This is the first time for England to run the referendum. The word 'Brexit' was used as part of following an example of the word "Greater" that was used when Greece was close to the Euro. A question from the Voters were asked, "it is important that Britain continues to remain a member of the European Union or out of the union? The question was proposed by the British Electoral Commission and agreed with the Government and the country's Parliament. Why has happened now: The move was done to complete the requirements of the Confedative Party as promised by the British Prime Minister David Cameron who promised to make a referendum if he would be elected again in the 2015 general elections. Generally the members of Confedative who are now divided over the membership of the EU for approximately 40 years. The low-ranking system in general wish to leave the EU while others who alia wish to stay in the community. The importance of the people who suggest Britain's withdrawal believe will support Britain's independence from the regime that is blocking the success of the creation of employment and allowing the country to choose its laws and business friends. Pro-British membership activists in a community like any other country will help improve the influence of the world in the issues of army and economic security. Voters deserve a British citizen of over 18 years is the ones that voted. This includes citizens in England and in other nations of the Commonwealth. It will take time to leave the EU law number 50 explains that any country member can withdraw but with several conditions. One of those conditions is that any process of suicide is completed within two years since the first day of starting that process. In that period England will continue to be accepted by the contract with the EU laws, but it will not participate in any decision. The things that will be considered before the departure will start talking about the sections of his departure. Major issues including things like financial regulations which will still be in the city of London, tax for business and the rights of civilian groups in the European Union. What are the effects that are seen in Britain's withdrawal? Some believe his withdrawal will encourage other nations to follow the referendum on their areas. "But I'm not Going to do it.

The southern provinces has all the qualifications to be a special region in the southern region of Tanzania includes the provinces of Lindi and Mtwara which for many years was behind development due to bad infrastructure especially roads. In the 1990s and back behind it was not an incredible thing to use more than two weeks for road transport for a journey from Dar es Salaam to Lindi or Mtwara, while at the moment it is six to seven hours. That situation was caused by poor conditions of the road and the absence of a bridge and a reliable ferry in Rufiji district. The speed of development in that provinces was very small to the extent that for the civil servants who were relocated to the provinces they saw as if they are being given punishment by their employers. In recent years, especially from the year 2000, the provinces of Lindi and Mtwara, has been a great attraction for the purpose of living with investments in the agricultural sector, industries and business. Those from different provinces in the country have been moving quickly in this regions and involved in agriculture, rearing and business. For this period the government intends to sincerely build the economy of industries, it is good to look at how it can use the opportunities available in this area. Southern provinces have both features and opportunities to carry OUT the industrial economy to our Nation. Those things, first in the provinces of Lindi and Mtwara has a big land that will not be used in production activities. South Africa's land has no conflicts and it is fit for economic activities. In that situation then if it will be given special strategies is enough opportunity for investment in agriculture, livestock and industries. The presence of a big and powerful land, enough rain, tambarare is an attraction of modern farming, rearing and construction of industries for farming and livestock. Another opportunity is the port of Mtwara which has the longest natural gas. The port of Mtwara is enough opportunity for the importation of natural resources from Mtwara and also transportation of goods to the country. It can be used as a door to be able to go to industrial products from this provinces and also lead to various natural resources. The port of Mtwara has a big area which can be used for expansion and construction of infrastructure to improve. Natural gas is another opportunity to guarantee a source of reliable energy for the use of big industries, small and homes. Also additional gas of natural gas, manufactured by publication can be transported to outside the country through the port of Mtwara. It is easy to attract investors to come to start industries in the provinces of Lindi and Mtwara, where it is where the natural gas of generating electricity for the purpose of industries. It is also a way to be able to revive and build other industrialized industries to increase the value instead of being sold with crude in foreign countries. Other opportunities for this regions are production of cashew nuts, cooking and sunflower. The production of this produce is an enough impetus for the start of factories of destroying cashew nuts and to decide the oil and sunflower oil. Farmers can be encouraged to grow up in large numbers, sunflower and cashew nuts and then to make sure the reliable market and a good price for those crops. It is easy to revive cashew nuts in the provinces of Lindi, Mtwara and Tunduru District than starting to build new industries in those provinces or other provinces in the country. Geographical in the provinces of Lindi and Mtwara, it borders the neighboring country of Mozambique which has good relations with Tanzania and therefore the industrial products that will be produced in this regions will have a good market in the northern provinces of Mozambique. On that logic, then it is a clear thing that these provinces have all opportunities to be done to be the special region of the economy of industries here in Tanzania. It will be surprising if the government will continue to attract investors to continue building industries in Dar es Salaam while in the southern provinces there are all opportunities in Dar es Salaam. South African residents should take advantage of these economic opportunities. Joshua Mnuchin is an analyst for economic and Social issues.

"But I'm not Going to do it. In the first part of this article last week, we saw how the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defense at the time, Oscar Kambona, was able to convince the soldiers who were arrested on January 21, 1964, to return to the camp, with a promise to address their complaints. We saw how the father of the nation, Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere, he was able to escape the State House to avoid the misunderstanding of the rebels who went to look for him, he went to hide in a place known. The teacher came out suddenly two days later, holding back to power again. However, four days later, the police responded again. Why? Follow this second and last place to get the answer. The second day after his return to the camp, the rebels seemed happy to see English officers leaving them as promised and Kambona. But one out of them wasn't happy like others: Sajini Francis Higo Ilogi. During the funeral of two soldiers on the day, those killed in the street with one Arabs during the rebellion, Sajini Ilogi left the talk about the face. So, is it because they are not able to implement all he promised? Is it because he won't be promoted after leading a rebellion? That day was received reports that the second squad of the army that was in Tabora had been asi, after getting news that Colito's colleagues were asi. They were possible or they had not received reports that Colito had returned to the camp; or they were aware, but they wanted them to do several things in their squad. While the Tabora road is continuing with the rebellion, it was received by a text from Kambona, that he had appointed Captain Miranda Sam Hagai Sarat, to be the head of the squad. At the same time Saracas and other officers were arrested and detained. Sarkin was married, asked the phone to be sent in a voice; then he gave the order to stand up "the same leg," teach the benchers and shot down. And they filmed it. That night, Saracon made plans to fly the English officers to Dar es Salaam and finally their homes. The event of January 21, and that of Tabora together with the situation in Kenya, Uganda and Zanzibar, made the British government to take additional caution by taking over 2,000 soldiers in East Africa. So, the submarine called Rhy, in the coast of Dar es Salaam, and another Centaur; which carried the plane, arrived with 600 soldiers. The third day after the first squad of the first squad on Wednesday, January 23 in the morning, suddenly Nyerere escaped from an open car with Mama Nyerere and the Minister of Internal Affairs, Job Lusinde who visited every part of the city that was affected by rebellion. On Thursday, January 24, it was well; but on Friday, January 25, talks between the government and the rebels seemed to be broken, they ended again. Who was the leader of the second rebellion? Sergeant Higo Ilogi again? Unlike the January 21 rebellion, which does not involve politicians, nor have a political target, the new rebellion was blocked by his political prisoners. Security reports showed that the leaders of the council of workers were meeting with the police who were arrested at the Colito Camp, and that those parties had organized a strike at the end of the week to join the police. The second rebellion was infectious in Kenya and Uganda, as well as the same day, at the same time, and in the same manner. Jomo Kenyatta and Milton Obote heard the hashtags; they are preparing to call the British Army to shut down the rebellion. Nyerere did not want. He did not believe that his own force would not be prosecuted, he and his government. He started believing when security officers showed a list of prospective ministers, that was organized by the rebels. One of his close people went further to tell him that he had been asked to accept to be the vice president after the revolution. A teacher akaloof; we will believe those words, that his government was at risk. Then, about 11: 30 p.m. on the day, a teacher tweeted at State House, Deputy Ambassador of England, Mister F. Stephen Mills; prompting military support. And without delay, Mills took a report to London and replied that the requests were accepted. And Oscar Kambona, went to a race in the British Embassy to look for Bregedia Douglas who was hiding in the country for the whole week, asked for help. On the night of that day, Douglas and another officer, took it up to the submarine Centaur that was in the coast. Saturday; January 26; 12: 20 am, six helicopter from the submarine Centaur took 60 soldiers (including Bregedia Douglas) to a nearby Colito Camp. 10 minutes later, at 12: 30 p.m., the submarine, and another war ship, Twitter, which was waiting for the coast; it started attacks by tanks to threaten rebels. From the distance of 20 meters right now, and with the courage, Douglas escaped with a microphone, that he held his power again; he gave an order to all soldiers to leave the camp with "weapons above" and sit down on the road. After 10 minutes without seeing something, he started counting, "one, two.... ten," the English soldier fired a rocket to the camp. The rebels started to surrender. In the next 10 minutes, 150 soldiers surrendered, and 150 others after one hour. By 1: 30 p.m., all of them had surrendered; the rebellion was denied in an exercise where five police officers were killed, and five others injured. There is no English soldier out of 60 who led the fight, who was injured. And for the whole week of rebellion, at least 17 civilians were killed. While the army of the British Army controlling the rebels of Tanganyika, in Uganda and Kenya and the army had taken a similar step, time, hours and in the same style to the police who had a question (Uganda), and in the 11th squad of Bark-Lanet (Kenya). When the reasons given to Sajini Higo Ilogi was able to get out, he was seen in the morning at the International Monetary Fund (Expcoms), sending a written phone to the UN Secretary General (UN), U Thant, to ask for help. The phone reads: "Tanganyika's forces were abducted by unknown soldiers. Help quickly bring the UN forces. Lieutenant Colonel ILOGI, Chief of Force. " Please go back to our basic question: Who sparked our military coup in 1964? Oscar Kambona? John Okello? Kambona, was the minister responsible for security at the time, where the army was under his ministry. For this reason, his participation in the first phase, cannot be taken that he had shares or that he knows that plan. It is his courage that he sent him to deal with that situation. If you could have had bad intentions to the government; and by considering how he was controlling the situation and the police accused him, he would have come to coup the country where it was in the prison for two consecutive days?. Is it "Field Marshal" John Okello? No; he did not have that time, because for the whole period since the revolution of Zanzibar, he was in the documents to protect and strengthen his administration in the Islands due to the threat of his opponent who claimed they did not participate in the revolution. Okello led the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar for two months in a row before he was excluded. It is not surprising that the rebellion of these soldiers was able to be infected with their Kenyan counterparts and Uganda, considering that the three countries have been born by the British colonization of the country. So, for that period, and in the same time, their grievances got to make it credible for their rights and in a similar manner. I agree with the opinion of Ambassador Abbas Kleist Sykes (quoted in a place in 2001), that, "Tanganyika's rebellion Rifles (ech) earlier in 1964, resulted in a large extent and the delay of the Kizungu's commanders and to promote Africans," as it happened to the police force and other employees in the government. And that's how it was in Kenya's rebellion and Uganda. It is not surprising that, the leaders of the Workers Union joined the rebels in the second phase wanting to bring down the government, from the fact that, since the teacher passed the "African disappointing exercise" in January 1963, they had been not sleeping "until it is understood." As a result of the rebellion, the teacher removed the whole squad of first (Colito Barniks) and to fire 100 police officers of the second squad, Tabora. He concluded that 10 percent of the 5,000 police officers who were at the country were unable to implement their duties. More than 400 people were arrested and questioned, including party leaders; and 500 others were arrested under the Law to prevent danger, but many were released. And the Federation of Workers of Workers in the country (TFL) was canceled, instead it has been formed by the party of NUTA as the ruling party of the ruling party - Tanu. The Teacher appointed Miranda Sam Hagai as the new Head of the Army, and took the rank to Bregedia. At the beginning of April 1964, the British Army left, and his position was taken by the third squad of the Nigerian Army, under Lieutenant Colonel James Pam. Sajini Francis Higo Ilogi was found guilty of the Army and was jailed for 15 years, 13 allies were jailed for five to ten years. The Swahili said, "every bad thing has its blessings." Mwalimu added the minimum wage for soldiers, from 105 / = to 240 / = shillings per month. But the most important thing is that, the rebellion was helping to interrogate and understand the kind of military needed for our country.

After a long cry of love soccer in the country to be unable to see the English Premier League with many lovers in the country, TBC One will bring the liberation in showing directly to that league at least for some of the matches. Even if the matches we were shown did not involve each other for the themselves of Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool but we have seen one of the teams playing with others together with other intense matches that involve the four teams of England with many lovers in the country. For that we are saying very much to TBC One and not to go back. More than the English Premier League, TBC One have been showing the Spanish Premier League and various soccer competitions including inside and outside of our national team, JK Boys are playing with Taifa Stars when they are protected! For all that we say no to TBC One. Together with those sincere gratitude, I request to say I'm sorry for the television station by leaving him because of the suffering that they give us in the implementation of that good thing to show us different soccer matches directly. While announcing the English Premier League matches directly through their World Cup of Football, the BBC London's Swahili show have been trying to inform one week before they were the match which they would show directly. BBC continued to do that until the morning of the broadcasting day of that match within the period of this week. Contrary, TBC One have been doing a lot of secrets about the match to show directly for the relevant week. And when they announce, the announcement is usually given a few times when they see them feel lucky. I don't know why they are not surprising early and for enough time so that many know that maybe the match that will be shown is on Monday at 5.00 pm between Everton and Middlesbrough. The results of "privacy" is that many soccer lovers have lost the battle when they could see. Another thing we are requesting me to curse each other is an act of assured that they will show directly the competition whose schedule is very easy but not to fulfill that promise fully. For example, in the European Nations competitions of this year in Switzerland and Austria, TBC One assured they will show the tournament directly. We were very happy with our love and respect to them, they went very high. Suddenly, our love and respect to them have dropped quickly after just two days of the tournament. After showing us the first match between the hosts Switzerland and the Czech Republic, he mentioned the news report that was followed by a series of business advertisements. Those announcements got the time to start the second match between Portugal and Turkey that has been eagerly awaited by many Tanzanians than the first one! Sadly, that match was not shown by TBC One contrary to the promise of showing that competition! The second day of the competition is not the first match of host Austria and Croatia nor the second match of Germany and Poland seemed to TBC One! I'm sorry to tell them that the second day event was to build a hatred and a lot of love for many soccer lovers of this country to TBC One for them which took them. The hatred is built up to see TBC One is butting them and it is set up to see TBC One is devastating. You don't respect and respect what you hate and ignore us? That of inciting violence is more serious. I love these Tanzanian soccer to see what they are being given, but it can be tolerated but it is difficult for them to endure the lack of disapproval of those changes. That's the worst. TBC with TBC One television, TBC's national radio and TBC FM together with the closeness of news newspapers today and the Daily News failed to tell the citizens in the whole country why it has been unable to fulfill his promise fully, it is very arrogant to the citizens. There should be no reason for all the citizens to be educated than to keep quiet and seem like they say "because they will do what the service itself is free"! That is unacceptable on the basis of better service to the customer (Good Customer care). For these two days, the complaints in the street against TBC One have been very big. Many saying it is the right to show that the competition will be given another television station in the country, maybe TBC One have been given a load! "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

"But I'm not Going to do it. July 31, 2013 some of the business people in Kariakoo, Dar es Salaam, yesterday blocked their shops opposing the use of electronic machines that are used to provide sales receipt as they were required by the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA). Those shops were scored from the morning and held demonstrations in the streets claiming that those machines are a burden to business people with the aim of oppression. Speaking to sports, businessman Mister. Samson Ngowi who owns a clothes shop in Aggrey Estate, said their stand is to stop the business they are undertaking until TRA will listen to their cry for not using those machines. "Due to the commercial circulation, those machines are a burden to our business people, a big part of the profit, is used to pay taxes thus delaying our goals. "We have done talks with TRA we agreed until November 15th this year, we should not continue using these machines now the action of staying silent is a sign that there is nothing that is going on," he said. He insisted that it is important for the government to recognize the real environment that the traders who use and the influx of taxes collected and caused them to continue. Another businessman, Mister. Juma Tinyango who is owning three shops that are in Kongo- Aggrey, Mwananyamala, said those machines are not recognized as a business procedure between the big businessman, middle and low. He said the cost of those machines are big without considering the income of the businessman thus if the government has the intention of reaching an agreement, it should give those machines free to business people. "There are small business people (pepper) who have spread the various streets of Karimoo contrary to the law, the guards who have been given the job of removing them getting bribes and leaving those businesses are not available because they sell products outside our shops," said Mister. Tinyango. He said that the government has been unable to remove those people whose businesses are planning outside their shops and they don't pay taxes, an issue that contributes to the use of those machines. And Mister. Winston Hemba said it has come at the time of the government to speed up the discussions between them and TRA in line with the answer to ensure the pain, they are removed quickly. Some of the business people in that area were seen not to know anything after going to their business areas and found many shops have been closed and they are forced to enter the strike if they fear to undergo violence if they will open and appear. Different people who came to Kariakoo to look for different needs and found many shops have been closed, they requested the government through TRA, to see the importance of doing a joint meeting with business people so as to finish the different differences. Mr Trump Said. Lucas Matata, a resident of Kibaha, Coast Province, said the closure of some of those shops especially medicine is a violation of human rights. On his part, the acting director of services and education to the taxpayer of TRA, Diana Masalla, said they have had talks between them and government officials thus any time they will release a statement on the government's stand. The armed Police Force (FFU), strengthened security in many streets of Kariakoo with fire weapons and tear gas to strengthen security. The police commander of Kipolisi, Ilala Province when they were looking for him from the morning so as to talk about the whole issue of safety in Kariakoo estates, his phone was being received by his assistant who claimed that the commander speaks with another phone. In October this year, the business people in Mbeya province also held a protest to boycott the machines in which the situation resulted in huge violence. The police force in that province, which was forced to ban tear gas to prevent the traders not to make a meeting aimed at opposing the use of those machines. Such violence has also happened the day before yesterday in Songea in Ruvuma province where business people have opposed the machines and claimed that they disturb them and sold at a high price. The traders said they are not ready to use those machines because they are aiming to suppress them, stop them without basic reasons and want the old system to continue. "But I'm not Going to do it.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_25986909 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. TFF to put it clear the regulations of his competition last week, the issue of Simba player, Novert Lufunga took the position in the headlines after the police soccer team defeated the appeals after the team brought together in the list while he has a red card. The police blocked the appeals for Simba for what terms as it made Lufunga in the Federation Cup last week. In that game, Simba won 2-0 goals. In his appeal, the police wanted to win a victory due to the step of Simba sprayed the player. However, TFF has dismissed the police appeals for details that it did not meet the criteria because it did not have 300,000 shillings that are supposed to be accompanied by appeals. However, together with TFF to leave that appeal, there have been various complaints of the law, regulations and procedures of the competition for what is explained to be a big part of the FA Cup, will be supervised by the rules of the premier league. Basically, what is needed is for TFF to make regulations that will make every independent competition because they have its approach. Even if some of the regulations are similar, there are other areas that will go to each other. The regulations of the FA Cup should be different from the premier league so as to eliminate the controversy that can come out. The good example is the FA Cup regulations, as well as being used in the Premier League, yet the FA Cup is a knockout, therefore there are areas where they are arguing. We think it is good for TFF through its technical committee to look at how to create regulations for every competition because the position is there and it is possible to do so. Making it easier for having one regulation in a different competition brings controversy. A good example is the code of 16 (2) which is saying, the competition of the Azam Sports HD competition will be led by these regulations as well as the regulations of the league VPL, FDL & SDL. The TFF competition committee will have a responsibility to review, discuss and give a decision on all the events that are happening every round according to the regulations of this competition and the league (VPL, FDL & SDL). Another area has said, the competition of the Azam Sports Federation Cup is for elimination, the use of the league regulations involve the areas that allow the operations of the knockout competition. This is one of the regulations, because the premier league has no knockout competition. Another problem is the regulations that were given by the FA Cup which does not have a section that includes cards, be red or yellow. Due to a lot of mix, that is why we want TFF to be with the regulations of every competition and it should set it open early before the concerned games to start because every club is required to understand and be focusing on. But this event should be a lesson, not for Simba and TFF alone, but with other clubs of the premier league or participating in the competition with an official procedure to have units that will help to put records for the club. If there is a memory, Lufunga wouldn't have a chance. The leaders of Simba, TFF everyone would be aware and it would not happen and cause complaints. "But I'm not Going to do it.

He has mentioned the vaccine that are reduced to be for the purpose of opposing the disease of surua and rubella (Mr), tuberculosis (BCG), polio (GV) and pepper spray (TT). According to Ummy, those vaccines are used for the sake of children when they are born up to two years and pregnant women according to the vaccination guidelines, given by the ministry to stop those diseases.

In this financial year, the government has set aside 60 billion shillings for those vaccines. He has said that despite the shortage of vaccination, there are some of the district vaccine, one type does not exist while other districts are many. He wanted the chief physicians of all provinces, to verify the statistics of vaccination and to distribute the district to the district so as to ensure the stations get the existing vaccine.

The harvest of the plantations are being taken to shut down the dangers of lack of food in the past season, was being led by the coalition of events while some of the areas receiving the harvest. This situation was contributed by climate change due to several issues, the main contribution of these changes being environmental destruction as a result of getting careless trees, delivery of dangerous gas from industries. First, some of the areas witnessed rain in large numbers that it poured during harvesting and this situation caused the harvesting and contributing food in the farm. The other areas didn't receive the rain completely, the plants went down soon after publication. The weather department issued an announcement that there would be a risk of food shortages in Africa and the Asian continent are some of the ones mentioned. This time I take the opportunity to give an opportunity to all who succeeded to get something. This is not the time to think things to sell yields. A reminder of Samuel, a bond scandal is not a joke ASEMAVVE on the head of CORE about the scandal of bond to be taken by humor. As the opposition leader, their responsibility is to look and criticize the ruling government. The issue of corruption has become a song in this country. Twaweza said Mister Raila Odinga only criticizes the government of Honorable Kenyatta but he should be sure of it. The government should listen and consider his term as he has not mentioned some of those involved in the scandal. University of Coffee The University of Somali University (CUE) is not to be taken by the country's university education commission (CUE) is not to be taken by any institution that holds high-level training in various sectors of conflicts in the community, and that it cares for our youth the tradition of many African nations to feel poor to see corruption in the country for now. Most of the young people have been quoted claiming that they can't stand up and get out of corruption. The issue that has left me a lot of attention. This is now the idea of developing young people with poor vision in the country and to sabotage the nation's economy. The claims that they made these youths do not have a stand because most of them claimed that everyone is involved, even us Twaweza. The government was volunteering to destroy illegal alcohol, most of the beneficiaries were young people. It is the responsibility of the government to explain the public how the allocation of those funds are run by projects implemented. GIDRAPH Mwangi (MC, Nairobi elite) Ten institutions of the university that were ordered by the commission have every reason to follow the order. Lack of adequate resources and basic infrastructure is one of the challenges that hit the universities emerged and contributed to the level of education in the country. My mission to the commission is to have a thorough investigation into every university crisis between various communities in the country has continued to destroy the innocent citizens.

This article will conclude my assessment of the 8th general meeting of CCM that took place in Dodoma since November 11th to November 14th this year. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Since the Party of Revolution (CCM) is a state of a dollar, its crush is usually lying to people and believe that every after the general meeting, CCM is always in afresh. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. This belief has been built up in the fact that, before the general meeting, there are some signs of mines and several groups of groups wanting their agenda to overcome. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Due to the control of state agencies together with the sidelines of the country, the plans are stuck and made many people believing that CCM has themselves, and those who do make it afresh every after the general meeting! "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The history of this concept is long, and the victims (victims) of this strategy in recent years is Salmin Amour (Komandoo), Mzee John Malecela, Doctor. Gharib Bilal, Samuel Sitta and now Edward Lowassa. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. In the past years, Mzee Aboud Jumbe and Sharif Hamad. Due to clear reasons, this strategy to give the new life CCM usually affects the people of Zanzibar than they are held. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. President Karume and "nonsense" as the vice chairman who is completing his term, the retired president of peace Karume was welcomed to give his advice on the day of closing the meeting. He gave a speech, which is now called for the cooking in Magogoni and Lumumba Street. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. There is no one that expected that Karume would say the words that he said that day, the amount of chairman Jakaya Kikwete admitting that he has never seen him happy with that amount "as he saw that day. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Several times his speech was threatened by people calling for him to finish and stay. This was reminded of the era of Benjamin Mkapa's chairperson when Kikwete netizens were calling for everyone who wanted to question the use of bribery in that meeting. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Mzee Joseph Butiku remembers this and he wrote a letter to the chairperson Mkapa. This will remember us that the boycott has not started with CHADEMA in meetings. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. When he was read to him, President Karume urged them to talk about the cries and contrasting of fish! Some claiming, President Karume was given a lot of attention to that day. He should have been given or thrown out; it is a bowl or not a mom; for me it is not the news. The important news is what he said for the minutes he was given. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Karume spoke about his ASP card (Afro Shiraz Party); he explained the purpose of ASP; he asked Doctor. Shein as he has his ASP card. One of the purpose of ASP reminded that it is to protect the freedom of Zanzibar and its people. Then he asked those who blocked their colleagues to give their opinions about the coalition. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. He reminded President Kikwete that he gave permission to everyone to say what he wants during the process of releasing a new constitution. He was questioning how many others are arrested for expressing their opinions. Karume reminded the way CCM has lost some of the states as a reason to ignore the opinion of the citizens. He reminded me of the shifts between the member of parliament and representative in certain province. Zambians did not want to hear this accused of the civilization of "allegiance." "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Let me say that even if I was tired, I sit outside the hall while he is speaking, Karume said things are more important than the hours given by other honorable members. In a short time, Karume called the dictatorial dictatorship in CCM; he noted the dangers that faces the union; he reminded the news of the shifts of leading the country that was caused by two countries; and more importantly, he said from his heart that ASP has not died because his members are still alive. CCM we have ze or we will say, that is the truth from Karume, who is now the name is nonsense and women Nape Nnauye. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. There was a hashtag for three days, Tanzania witnessed more than 2000 members who were crying and complaining inside the hall. The chairperson launched the attack and was received by delegates at the official meetings in the sleeping houses and in vehicles. The Shadow Party of Democracy and Development (CHADEMA) formed a lot of delegates and made the leaders to lose direction and start insulting the careless. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. It was not expected that the chairman also would have entered into the trap, when he found them to insult the opponents and especially CHADEMA by calling them "bad people," or when in NEC, he is using a lot of time to beat Nape Nnauye because he knows how to be with CHADEMA. Even when he was reminded by his friend that to insult CHADEMA, it is not a must to get CCM, he threatened to say "they have left Nape to address them." The work that defeated him, he sees it best to make Nape. As Mzee Rasheed Kawawa when he used to a teacher, Nape is the same for Kikwete! "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The old man from the Southern Highlands questioned, how come CHADEMA be a threat to CCM than corruption and corruption is a threat? CHADEMA come as a threat than "undugged" stations "that is interested in the position of recognition in our party's constitution? "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. He said, how come the chief advisers of our party's chairperson about the issues of the party, not sessions but are the security that are fitted? This was the same symbol and many who were complaining for three days of the meeting. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Membe: Alimitating Mangula; has changed again. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The position of Bernard Membe for the politics of this nation in the future was in a very difficult exam. The camp of his former friend, Edward Lowassa was unable to bear him but he was rescued by Kikwete and his family. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Kikwete helped him by changing the voting schedule, while his family (his wife and his child) were worried every corner to seek votes Bernard Membe. This nation one day will claim to know the truth of tensions and friendship of these three people - Membe, Kikwete and Lowassa. Name Kikwete is getting ready in the middle. She is the key to this uncertainty. We had to leave it Now. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Mzee Philip Mangula when he emerged as a sudden as the vice chairperson of CCM Mainland. This is also the online group that brought him to the State House, claiming that he was disappointed during that company and decided to throw him soon after Kikwete was sworn in. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Yassaid, Benard Membe, an experienced man and an illusion of the strategies of the natural network, told Kikwete that Mangula gave him a very difficult situation thus he is removed from the position of the secretary general of the party. It does not end up there, Mzee Mangula when he tried to show up to Iringa as the chairman of the province that was dealing with him and was defeated by a person who does not belong to CCM for all the criteria. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Mzee Mangula admitted later that inside CCM, the leadership is on an auction and the voters do not want to stop the candidates' leaflets, but they want to "be swept away." Mzee Mangula, whenever he is reminded of the activities of the network, he always thinks that he was being offered by "faulty." "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. There is news that Mzee Mangula has emerged with the support of Membe. That, several sessions were done to Makambako among these two. Whether for Membe to be willing or sent, it is that they met the agenda was an election in the 8th general meeting. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. He was apologized or had not been asked, that is not the news. The news is that the general meeting has given Mzee Mangula as the deputy chairperson of CCM but the chief executive was Membe. If this project was for the benefit of the party or for the benefit of his network he is designed for 2015, it is an issue of time. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. If it is true, then it will be difficult to denounce the networks inside this party. As Membe's network is legitimate, Lowassa cannot be illegal. If Kikwete entered with the internet, it is difficult to think about CCM and the presidency without the internet. And we have learned in bitterness that the network did not get in the elections because, after their person being elected, what is next is to benefit the sweat and the fruits of work. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. For those who failed, there is a work to assess where they are stuck and hoped continental. It is a dream of each other to break the groups when whoever wins and entered the State House continues with his group. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Only one thing the Elder Mangula was to read it. Membe who is alleged to bear him after the 2005 elections in front of Kikwete, he cannot change today and defend himself as a good person who goes to the party. Why did he not be in 2005 under the chairman hug this? Membe is the same one, the chairperson is the same one, the party is what and Mangula is the same one! What has changed to make Mangula who is not in 2005, afae in 2012? "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. What is seen but you are not surprised but clearly, it is the fact that Kikwete and Membe see companion / rival Lowassa being more than the presidential candidate of CCM 2015. For them, Lowassa has turned out to be a party; he has ruled CCM in front of their eyes and think Mangula will help them to save CCM that is hostage in the hands of Lowassa. Kikwete and Membe have not said the story is what has created Lowassa and made him put him out of CCM. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The act of returning to the former "enemy" and their party will be able to help them to form the party that destroys it in their hands, is not understandable. Many thought, the general meeting would garner the opportunity to assess this situation, instead we ended up with arguing that are not an order. We wait for another special general meeting or that of 2017. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

If you are wanted that you got a certain team that has brought ownership has come. And troops There is nothing else I'm talking with fans of talking about it The team as a team is talking about those who go to the field, those twenty-two players took it until they represent the team but even teams like the team are fans who support that you know completely, I am a fan of Simba and Simba, we are so many shows that how they have Simba's strong power I am talking about. We fans are the team But the team's comments are ten and one in the field, those who represent those fans are another issue that can talk about.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_25853684 Welcome to the sufficient magazine and I don't want this today to look at the small cotton sector where we will bring together with various stakeholders of this sector who together are trying to come up with answers to the questions of various challenges facing the evidence sector, I can be the second in a foreign currency. On behalf of all those who will participate to make sure there is an average while inviting them in the third visible Journal. The stakeholders of the small cotton sector gathered so as to come together with the answers of the challenges facing the sector It is at the conference that took place in Dar es Salaam city, including the heads of the heads of districts, farmers processors of cotton board to make business and sponsors of various programs of cotton farming. Nearly twenty years ago the cotton farming was used as one of the major revenue sources to the residents of the lake region and other parts of the country. Two farmers were raped in hope of farming as a better light in their future Like this, it went hand in hand with the start of the production of clothes and different products that come from cotton. It is estimated that more than one million and five hundred thousand people out of one hundred and eight hundred thousand, nine hundred and nine hundred thousand shillings were benefited from two including food digestion, producers of clothes and cooking oil. In one hundred and ninety six hundred and ninety minutes got into the open market for the hopes of improving more in the whole issue of production The cotton board started to witness the conflict that is closely caused by politics and the tension of power within the political parties and Putin in general In accordance with the agricultural law of the contract to be operated on major milk like cotton coffee, tea tobacco and sugarcane, however, the contract of the contract we have not defended the big sanctions for the crops as the sun first takes. Along the conference of the stakeholders of the small cotton sector that took place in Dar es Salaam city, minister of agriculture, food and corporate in the government of the United Republic of Tanzania, Engineer Christopher Chiza will speak about the farming of the contract Mi has said that farming for a contract as agriculture is not bad. What is needed is, you know that I have passed away in my conversation there that any development process will be addressed. That starting the farming of a contract, there are things that we expect to be on the contract is between the person's kulu. He has been cheated They scary Now, more importantly, what is needed is all of them to be done for example The contracts must be in the language that both of them understand what is scared, how will we get money Halo The only one she gave you must be honest to the sir, the end of the day I will have to take a must be what is legal. If you look at the system is good Because you can enable farmers to get input for what we need sa Mi my thoughts that I believe names It is to look at what matters that are in the farming of the contract He has not been pleased with the farmers we have reversed more than to say the procedure of a contract from people here in the world because we implemented well, we will enable farmers to get loans And then these others provide loans Giving loans, we must enable them to get their money that they were given now, that is the challenges that are there. It is stated that the small cotton sector in the country has the ability to empowering the cotton farmers in a pit of poverty if the government in collaboration with other stakeholders will help to help the existence of a contract to resolve the challenges facing the agriculture. The farming of the contract first is not that those pictures will not be made in trial for three years in a row If you accept what it deserves and that's six reasons They decided to Bariadi tribes and that money because it deserves to see the whole country When there is a problem here on its implementation, there are some of the stakeholders who have different goals and aimed at others who are not faithful who failed integrity but agriculture of the contract is the only way that he will kill six cotton will be ordered by the farmer to raise the name and names in the meaning of those with industries that will be ordered by the farmer. He has been found and buyers will get the cotton board to buy so that they are required to work on the night don't get cotton to sell and eventually be able to sell and also the district councils will get the taxes that the tax of the produce is paid sex. That farming of the contract, in my opinion, you will know that it will be able to save the farmer. We've got a great opportunity for the first time we started in bed the groups will be better than we are told everyone has joined the group because first I think. Thirty and two hundred people. So on me the sides that you know in that class has four divisions but when the wards in the Division we can be better in different wards so every village, we have taken a big step in every thirty group who is himself Sango we met. What are the fruits to see the sun will be given so the last day are good people who are growing even if they got the last day you are ready to come up to say we got a lot of money and also a company that has scared the drugs that we will see. So We tell its citizens that we pray for him. To get into the market early so that citizens should not be able to go to search for another one, so it helps the citizens to take money while so as to sell the time so we can't live at a time when I think he will get our minerals that is why I see charcoal and eight percent from the year up to this year, your body then there are two thousand dollars a year, we can be able to link between ten and seven million tons that should be handled according to. The Kanumba was Western. Four hundred grams will drop down in one acre A new system without seeing three When we had the expectations we had, according to the status of both sides, there is insulting insults that are against them. They may not be able to shut down the fire is six seven lions. It was bought an average which would probably produce. What happens from five hundred to look for him One of us, we have seen is because you know we have been suffering from the price has been not good. And then produce depending on one acre, I will be better than what it is doing, it is doing it will be above us We would like to look for Europe and groups. The devil to go there is our third hope I have been doing well and among them are youths who have taken the youth Brother, we are tired of Kariakoo in the special commission and we know from the style by going to Singida. The youth who deserves to be sold for that house more than two hundred hectares and ninety minutes in Mbutu bridge, the village of bukama have been told me I am saying the youth who benefited from walking and it is surprising that the meetings has brought up so much that we are doing to be his death accident. The agricultural transport of refuse that is a very big problem because there are people who came to there. Ehr goes to the middle and confused. There is Spokespersons for real speed Because they grow their farm on the farm. You can't talk about someone that is on the farm about this time of talking on the topic. Because you are supposed to be in a group quickly, which on Monday Therefore, we are striving so much in bringing a big problem is that it is not that the farming is not enough to inform you here to make a good number of change, like five books as it is known that cotton gold are sold and even the service will rise So here as the other one that has ever seen in the Riders. Five days than coffee But it seems that it seems to be misleading. The real intent of the government sometimes translated If you will be released Agriculture of the contract is good because you are sure of selling your produce and the price that is at the same time because I go with the price in the world market to know that the past was you don't know because he said, we will communicate with him and the contract that Bana want to sell our cotton on the price in the world market and information to the public maybe we wait for us. A date, then we shall begin to do about buying so that we will look for its beauty benefits for the contract. I started when I was a lot of land without a contract. I was in the past when we entered the farming of the first contract we would know I had been cheated. That is what you need First, it was a lot of a lot of farm after getting into the farming of a contract after making sure everything I bought at ten and six but in the past, it must be two depending on the ability of a contract with my fellow farmers because agriculture of the contract had a lot of need and education get a lot through our sponsors who visit them. That is until now the farmers had a need for farming for a contract that is the other than it means that someone gets benefits through the loans. And the destruction is also one of the challenges in the farming of cotton industries, which is used including farming and control of non-political parties. And maybe

Written by Vicky Kimaro "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Published: 19 November 2016 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The round of the Premier League, the first step has ended recently and for now the teams are in the process of making adjustments to their squads, for the second round of the league that was planned to officially start early next month. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Already some clubs have already started calling for the signatures of new players for the purpose of strengthening their squads for different goals. The giants Simba, Yanga and Azam are fighting for the championship, there are teams like Mbao, Water Water, African Lyon and others will go to the country to drop the bridge. Most importantly, the players are required to be careful, not to blame them in their decisions of burning ink in various teams. Players should ask the heads to make a decision by being convinced, a supporter of the club and the club leaders, especially old when they voted for their neck. The players, especially the upcoming stars must evaluate their ability and the club they want to go to play for them if they are against them and it will be able to help them develop their talents or get in and finally be the veterans at a small age. The period of registration is the season of yields not to the players, but even the aides and coaches of the club, it will look for that registration to be done with professionalism of the high level for the benefit of both sides in the meaning of players and the concerned club, so as to end Tanzania's soccer. We will not expect the folks that have occurred in the big registration window, when Hassan Kessy serving Yanga is still in a contract with Simba, a decision that until today you know him while he doesn't know the fate of his case which Simba have wanted to be paid 600 million shillings. The first round we have witnessed some of the players while signing up due to cheating and causing them to be punished by the committee of law and dignity of players of Tanzania Football Federation (TFF). The problem of cheating to the players has been seen to be sustainable in Tanzania, although for a certain period, it has reached especially in the premier league but in the high levels of cheating has been huge and complaints have been many. In the premier league, the issue of players to register two teams has been a normal thing and has already taken them to the ears of soccer stakeholders because of that case repeatedly. All the time the registration of controversy in the premier league even if it is contributor usually is involved in the old Simba and Yanga clubs. All cases that have shaken the media here in the country will involve the clubs themselves by themselves or themselves by other clubs where they are for its player. We have also witnessed the players being banned for a lot of mistakes like that, that were ever done by players in the past and given punishment by TFF, but the issue is seen to be a difficult thing for the players. When I know, the greed of money, the us of the law have been passing some of the players and find themselves getting into a crisis that is contributor and others have threatened to be banned from being involved in soccer for a period of six months to one year. The Association of players of Tanzania Football Association (Souza), although it does not involve the punishment but it is believed that there is a time it is good for the punishment to be given so as to stop the behavior of cheating and building discipline in the soccer game. "If we will defend this issue because we will be promoting electoral fraud, often we refuse a player to be given a great punishment for being locked up or one year because we believe that it has a great impact because a player is expecting to play as its employment, but in such cases we must build discipline in our players to discover and respect the law," says the secretary general of Simeone, Mussa Kisoki. Kisoki said it has come now during the players to register in their party so that they can help them manage their contracts and not to wait until they walk to the conflict with their clubs. They must participate in the players of the Premier League and the First Division League on their rights and responsibilities, their freedom in registration issues and other important things that bring mistakes to players especially in contracts and registration. The players should be keen in getting contracts and if it will be possible to have the lawyers of supervision. I believe things are mixed with a lot of attention to both sides of the leaders and the club coaches it is clear we can witness the premier league more than the first one that ended with Simba to sit at the peak with 35 points.

The second part of this article that was published in this newspaper last Wednesday, explained the statements of various groups of people mentioned to contribute to a non-profit conflict between the North Mara Gold Mine (North Mara Gold Mine - NGrand) and residents of villages that are neighboring that mine. Those groups include the management of African Barrick Gold (ABG) that runs the mine, the residents of those villages, political leaders and journalists. Previously, in a special interview with Good Citizen, the district commissioner of Tarime, where it is mine, John Henjewele, who brought the finger to those groups saying that it is the source of that conflict due to putting their personal interests. However, after being questioned by this newspaper in different times, some people from those groups tried to avoid the blame and others confessed to contribute to that conflict. This third place and the last part, describes the recommendations that were given by different stakeholders about methods and procedures that can help solve the conflict and eventually improve relations and enable each side to benefit from the quarry at satisfactory level. The stakeholders suggesting the crisis Augustino Sasi, a resident of the village of Keith, which runs the NGrand, is proposing to have a partnership of sharing benefits that are derived from the mining of minerals in that mine. That, instead of an investor to pay compensation for various assets of the villagers that are taken to pave way for mine activities, to accept to pay the amount of money that they will agree every month until the mining will end in that area. "The leadership of the mine agreed to enter into partnerships with us villagers we are taken from the neighborhood to mine, meaning you have given me the amount of money we will agree every month or two months," says Sasi and continued: "The procedure will avoid the complaints that are currently including breaking down and break the compensation of our property. Therefore, the concrete solution to the current crisis is to enter into partnerships in order to each other side of the gold that is mined in this mine. " A resident of Tarime town, Samwel Magoiga, is proposing to have a procedure of that mine to ensure that every year you have the council of that district, the benefits of money driven by mining for the sake of costs of improving social services to the citizens. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Magoiga who is the Executive Director of the Tanzania House of Employment Creation - TAHEC), with its headquarters in Mwanza, insists: "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "That strategy will help to end the conflict between the two sides, and especially if the government will use those funds well by solving the problems of the residents of the villages that are neighboring that mine as it is not Tarime in general. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "You know what is happening now is that people organize symptoms (symptoms) of the disease (the conflict) instead of the cause of the disease. The investor is dealing with the crisis for its benefit, the government will deal with the conflict with the benefit of the investor, while a villager being put aside, that will not end the conflict. "On the other hand, the crisis is being held by politicians or not knowing, or by knowing. I think we should agree directly that the amount of income of mine be taken to the district council to be used to solve the problems of the citizens, "insists Magoiga and added:" I have emphasized that, because this problem affects the residents of the villages that are neighboring that mine, the government should have a procedure of cooperating with them closely in ensuring that mine is giving them their rights. "On the other hand, the ensuring that it helps the first villagers to also be a strong partnership with the investor, the government and villagers to transparency in issues concerning mine, to have a joint statement, but the largest villagers do not have their priorities. "Another, I heard that the mine wants to start underground mining (low-mining) so as to avoid using a high cost of paying compensation to citizens who are taken from the neighborhood and mine. I am saying that the technique will not help to end the conflict, instead it will continue to promote the current crisis. "So, I think villagers are given the first opportunity. Again I use this opportunity to urge the villagers to use this period of local government elections to choose good leaders with the will and commitment to help solve the conflict. " The journalist, the representative of awn newspaper in Tarime district, Igenga Mtatiro, says the concrete solution of the conflict is the implementation of the promises that were given by the investor of that mine to the villagers. "The first thing, the investor will implement contracts or agreements that he entered with villagers including building the Technical Training College (Veta) and giving them before December 31st, 2014. "It is also an investor to show small miners to get mining areas, modern equipment for extraction, and training on modern technology of driving mining and environmental conservation. This will help to end the conflict that is with the villagers will not have tensions against the investor in that mine. "He is also an investor to ensure that he will pay the public compensation for the time. But also leaders and employees of mine should have a procedure of visiting villagers, to listen to the challenges they are facing and cooperating with the government looking for solutions. "Another thing, the leaders of mine and the government should stop the tradition of marginalizing journalists in Tarime district and Mara province in general in encouraging investment and mining of minerals in that mine," said Mtatiro. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The District Commissioner of Tarime, Henjewele, has said that the step of removing villagers from the neighborhood and that mine is implemented effectively, it will help to eliminate the conflict between the two sides. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "The investor will implement his role in ensuring that both People live within a distance of 300 meters away from the mine are being treated. All the people living in the neighboring mine for that distance is supposed to pay compensation for their properties in order to protect themselves because of protecting the safety of their health, "says Henrik. On their part, the head of police of Kipolisi Tarime / Rorya, the Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Benedicto Mambosasa and the lawyer of NGrand, Abel Yiga, say that the education of citizenship to the villagers about the issue of investment in mines can help solve the conflict. "The government is cooperating with politicians to work in educating villagers because those sides are being heard by the citizens. The education gives the citizens the importance and benefits of investment in their areas, "explains Yiga. "Citizens have the right to be educated on the importance of foreign investors in the country. It is good for those villagers to know that the investor is legal and the policy of our country is to encourage a good environment for foreign investors, "said Commander Mambosasa. Unlike other mines, NGrand was discovered in the middle of the people's residence, therefore, in order to break the health effects, it must relocate them to pave way for mining activities that was not harassed after paying the compensation of their various properties. However, there was a violation of regulations and procedures of paying compensation and transferred from the neighborhood and NGrand, a situation that sparked a conflict between the management of that mine and the villagers. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The tensions are the cause of the acts of invasion, looting, and destruction of various property in the mine committed by some of the citizens, especially young people who are looking for livelihood for subsistence and their families. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

Some of the scholars on education issues, have supported the government's step of wanting all schools that provide a lot of education, to follow two years of studies on details that they make students get time to rest, but also give an opportunity for the government to implement its educational plans. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. While speaking yesterday with this newspaper, the scholars said there are issues that are being done by the government even to private schools and gave an example of sports and secondary schools together with the examinations of the national exams. Professor Justin Galabawa of the University of Dar es Salaam said that the operators of the school in the country must agree with a two year education system which gives the student an opportunity to breathe. He said that a student is running for a long time in school like that period of three years, his productivity in the performance of examinations is poor. "It is good to have two seasons, this gives students a chance to breathing at home in the middle of that period and even when they return to school they are and Mori to read more," said the education expert. He said any education system in the world must follow the requirements of the government so as to give an opportunity if there are activities that are implemented by the government among those schools that will not be affected. "For example, there is a moment there is a moment there is a games of crashtag and Umiseta, this is a competition involving all government and non-government schools, how can it be done when other schools are blocked and others continue with studies? She asked. He said the decision by the government to want all schools to have two years is good, because even when the government is postponed something, if doing the Mock exams will involve all schools because all of them are made in one system. "I advise my fellow school owners to follow this procedure is good, not to end the government, these are leading the education system in the country," said Professor Galabawa who also owns Thomas More Machina Secondary School in Dar es Salaam city. And Professor of Engineering construction of the University of Dar es Salaam, Aloyce Mayo, who is also the director of Alpha Secondary School, said a two term system that has been set by the government is good for all schools that are educated. Professor Mayo said that two seasons which in the middle has a short break, and he is questioning, "I know why some of the owners are holding onto three years, I do not see if it has a lot of productivity different from this two." He said he is one of the leaders of private schools and through their union, they don't see the school problem having two seasons. He added that the problem has been there more to the owners of private schools that are the believers of three years. "It's possible for them to have basic reasons, but to me two years that has mid-term (a short break) is good for the running of the school," explained Professor Mayo. There have been news that there have been tension between the government together with some of the owners of private schools about the period of studies. The government has released a new document of the year 2015 which directs that all schools must have two seasons and a short break to each other. But private schools themselves have been paying three years on claims that it provides an opportunity for children to be home during rains and cold and also get affordable parents and guardians in issues of paying fees.

It is joy to get another time to learn together on various issues so that we can achieve success we will expect every day. Today we learn about different financial secrets as a continuation of a series of personal economy. There are several unanswered questions. There are some who wish to know the secret of money that will not be buried many. Some are unable to understand why some rich people are losing all their properties and be poor again. Goals is no success that is found without being preceded by goals. So as to get great success in life, it is important to know how to saving the goals that will bring you. These goals are supposed to be more than the results of work or daily activities. The farmer can have the intention of increasing the harvest or an employee who wants to be willing to lead the salary. Goals are required to be bigger than these things. For us, you want to go, use a few minutes think about what you want to fulfill your personal life. Regardless of your queries, you start to live your new life by making important changes now. Look and choose a better way to improve the mind and the body as well as those that are not required to change. Evaluate the kind of relationship that you want and the skills you want to learn. Take the necessary action in everything you thought you should leave it. This is one of the important steps to start the journey of life that you expect. This is an easy and important part. His intention is to give me a personal challenge, to win misconceptions and raise the enthusiasm of your dreams. First thought of goals is a thought later words. Life is the door of the sea that allows news, cases, reports and words. One story begins another. You are like the world as a satelist and you need a merger for this to happen. But he has the ability to produce 60,000 ideas a Day. Experts advise you to take one of the great influence and make preparations so that it can happen. Use the paper and pens to link the thoughts and words that goals before you see the results that you expect. One of the important things that you should consider when it comes to the success is the words that you tell you every time. Most of what we tell you regularly is what makes our lives maybe even without knowing. Life goes like that. Every mindset of your life will be done. Your thoughts are changing your future life. I believe there are things I always tell me almost every Day. You can also say that I will succeed my final exam, I am poor, I can't succeed, I am bad, agriculture cannot me, this year is hungry and so many others. That you are telling you regardless of there is no other person who is heard or you see that they do not mean in the normal state that makes your life and give you real results. Your mind is listening carefully to the ideas. Realize, everything you tell you happens in your daily life. It may not be today. Know you only know that the mind does not implement your orders to you, therefore it is wisdom to choose the thoughts that reflect your thoughts. Think about the failure or the health that would be like that. If you will tell you victory, your success will be done even in an environment that you depend on to complete your goals. Your words are growing up in mind in your mind. Your brain is always Going to have a higher level to implement what YOU're told. Once you look for a way to achieve that you were told. Let it reach a place to know the strength of the words that you tell you that they have a great ability to complete your goals and change your life. This is a law used by people with enthusiasm for development. Ugandans, scientists even leaders and politicians. Change your minds. When you check the words that you tell you many days of the past, you will discover that it has been done in a way that you expect. If there was a time I was told you are a poor and continued to be with them for a long time, I have no doubt that weakness is the same until now. Time and time I choose the good words of spreading herself every morning, day and evening or night. Do you make your goals succeed as it happened to other people. When you have a thought of something or something, it is good to you use the time to discuss with its range. It is best to sit for three hours to plan to do and stop at half an hour to get numerous benefits than planning for 10 minutes something he will implement for several weeks for a small profit. Your head is your life. Your hope is encouraged by your brain if you will learn how to use it. The brain is causing the ability to do a lot which in common mind will not be surprised. You have the opportunity to fulfill what you want to change your thoughts and will put the real plans without giving up on the process or be shaken by the challenges that will come up to the success of your dreams.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_98053486 Farewell Mohamed Kingolile "Boxing Day" APR 09, 2015 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. When I was a spokesman and finally the Secretary General of the Simba Club, there is no branch that I have been close as that of football and development. There were two main reasons, first, it was his closeness to my office and secondly the creativity that was with them. The closeness I speak is that most of them were doing their activities at the headquarters of Msimbazi Club in Dar es Salaam city. It was not easy to pass one day of work without meeting at least one member of the branch. The creativity I talk about is that of the branch to make things like calendar and photos that later they sell and get money to run their activities. It is in those working environment, then I met a person named Mohamed Kingolile popularly known as "Boxing Day" who died in the bus accident last week in Morogoro town when he and his colleagues in a way to Shinyanga province to watch the match between Simba and Kagera Sugar. Six members died in the jail. He is the former secretary of the branch and in more than one; the leader of that branch. Many Simba leaders, and other clubs here in the country, at the level of branches have died and I have never seen them to start. Today, I have been arrested for boxing for the reason to celebrate all the people of his own kind in front of justice without being known nationally, although they had a great contribution to the soccer game. Kingolile and his colleagues in the group, they were ensuring that they have arrived in the club from 12 and a half o'clock in the morning up to two o'clock in the morning for the purpose of winning the soccer game. This discussion was important for people who didn't go to watch the last match between Simba or they don't understand about the new news about the club. For workers in town who are forced to arrive in the city before their offices have not been opened, Msimbazi is "bold" to challenge him time before people go to their activities. Many people do not know but in the football and development group, there is someone where he is called Chinga due to that he is dating in the southern provinces of Tanzania but his colleagues have called Shafih Dauda. He has been given that name because of his ability to explain the game. I mean, there are people who give money so that he should go to watch the match on the field so that after the game, whether tomorrow or any day, he can explain to them not to go about what happened. If there is a new player that is signed by Simba and he has done exercises for one day and Chinga asked him to ask him only and he will know that if a player is good or bad. Boxing will be canceled without having financial ability, they were ready to travel at any cost to go anywhere where Simba plays. Many times arriving at the concerned region the same day of the match and turning back to Dar es Salaam just after the match. Boxing is one of the people that were ready to do anything to help Simba got victory. There are a lot of things to also seek a win that he was doing that for a special reason I won't mention in this article. Kingsile was residing in the front seat on the second side of the driver when they traveled. The goal was to be able to be heard easily when he wants to give a report while in the car but also in front of people who see then they know Boxing is going on. In the Tanzanian football that has not gone on big strategies for the announcement, the buses of fans is one of the inspiration that will announce this game. Even if someone had no plan to go to a mph, what more exciting stuff in the road makes people change ideas and come to the field. Always, I believe that people like Kingolile are the ones that do football fans to continue going to the field here in the country while in the neighboring country, the number is going down every day. I had to look at the Uganda Football Premier League match two years ago at the Mandela Stadium in Kampala, and I'm sorry to see that less than 400 people have gone to watch the match. If you check keenly, together with other factors mentioned including the strength of the English Premier League, you will discover that one of the reasons is that the country is not again with the Kingsile and the branches of clubs like Football and Development, Football and Development, Wekundu la Terminal, Yanga pipeline and others. The people doing this game is attractive, like Kingolile, Doctor Yamungu Kayandabila Morogoro and others, should be recognized as part of the people that should be respected. These are people whose lives have been given because of this game. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

The dream of the residents of Mbeya City to see changes and important improvements in the infrastructure sector, it has finally been fulfilled after the completion of one of the roads that are ongoing at the moment in that town. The most important road that was completed recently, is the Airport- Samora, which serves residents of Ice area, or Airport, as it is known for the majority, which is complete with a tarmac. However, together with that road to be completed and therefore easing travel communication between those areas, the fear that the citizens are about the accident. "And we now have people after listening to the tarmac roads. In fact, it's like I dream as well, it will help to transport our crops from farms. We are producing Mbeya City for vegetables and fruits, "says a resident of Swaya town after the road was placed on a tarmac class on Saturday last week. Swaya town is on the outskirts of Mbeya city, and it is popular for vegetables, their main market in the middle of the city, and therefore for the citizens of that area to their importance is transportation of their produce easily and faster. Apart from the transportation of food production from Swaya Ward, the completion of that road is a great comfort to the students studying in Samora Secondary School who were forced to walk on foot by approximately two kilometers per day due to lack of transport between the Mafiat station and in the school where the new road is threatening. That road of 1.24 kilometers, known as Airport- Samora Road, is part of the roads with a length of 28 kilometers that are based in the construction of the roads of that city at a tarmac level that started in November last year and is expected to be completed in June next year. The adviser from Techniplan SpA- Itali, M. Haq, says he is satisfied with the quality of work that was shown by the company that builds the road of CICO China. He says the level of quality and efficiency of the work they showed technicians at the construction of that road is hoping for the work to be completed at the time set and on the quality they agreed on the contract. The view of that expert is similar to the citizens of Mbeya town who explained openly being satisfied with the quality of that road by looking at only, with some of the engineers from different cities that are in that project in the country, they noted that the level has confirmed the control of the tender for some of the perpetrators saving famous as "ten percent." "Here there is no" ten percent, "that is why even the president of the company has come, again with his wife, it has proven" ten percent "that the contractors, not less than 40 percent of all the work payments, that is why they are paying for them," says one engineer from one of the cities in the country. According to the acting secretary general, the Office of the Prime Minister (Education), Tuesday Sagini, the councils of all the cities in the country, seven municipal councils and the headquarters of Dodoma (CDA), benefit from the plan of improving towns in the country that is being implemented by funds from the World Bank (WB). According to Sagini, the program will cost more than 200 billion shillings, it is about the construction of road infrastructure, markets, madampo, buses and improving the environment. He says together with other things, that the implementation of those projects are different from depending on the needs of every city and the municipality. Those roads are a great comfort to the residents of Mbeya City and that province in general, where now they are supporting this year 2012 with three major projects of pride, because of Songwe International Airport, Mwanjelwa is and tarmac roads that are ongoing in the city. The completion of the Airport in Samora, makes it open to the hopes of the residents of that town who previously bought up, to the extent that it was not surprising to find themselves on the village's legitimacy of their city's status, the main reason being to see things going well like they had expected, and especially when they were compared to the years before promotion. It is on the basis, some of those citizens in their village, they are not aware of the government of President Jakaya Kikwete for good development activities that will implement in Mbeya province, and especially the improvement of road infrastructure in that city. The Songwe Airport together with Mwanjelwa is expected to be launched at any time from now, while the construction of tarmac roads in that town will be ongoing but some of its will be completed ready to reach June next year, having a length of 28 kilometers. Since December 13th this year, Songwe Airport started being used, and according to the manager of the stadium, Valentino Kadeha, the only thing expected is the official launch that is expected to be done by President Kikwete. However, construction is only one thing in strengthening the road infrastructure in the city, the foundation is its protection, something that is a big problem, not to Mbeya City alone but for the whole nation. According to the Director of Mbeya City, Juma Iddi, the preparations have taken place about the care of those roads, including meeting with the leaders of the ward and the streets and explain to their responsibility in overseeing the care of those roads, including a careless waste, where the city will ensure that waste more than "maguba" that are in the road, and that even the citizens have been educated already. "Citizens must know that these funds (used to improve the infrastructure of Mbeya City) is a loan from the World Bank, so we will come to pay," said Iddi. In this issue of conserving the infrastructure of community services, the acting secretary general, Sagini, has ordered local government authorities in the country to supervise the small laws that are available on environmental cleanliness so as to protect the road in the country which he says cost a lot of money. In addition to the construction of road infrastructure, the program of improving Mbeya City (face lifting) is also about the construction of the main bus station of passengers and cargo in the Nane Nane area, road lights and the waste water (land fill). The roads that are being built in money from the World Bank were divided into two phases. The first phase will involve 13.2 kilometers on the road starts in Sae through the electricity station of TANESCO to the University of Theater Kisanji (TEKU) together with the Airport through Jacaranda to the fuel station in the Forest. Other roads in that phase is that Commissioner Road which begins at the Uhuru Stadium to Weru Garden to Uzbelow, block T starts to Kabwe heading to the Church of KKKT Luanda, up to SIDO and Oil Station Com Soweto, and the beginning of the Sea (TANESCO) to the Clinic of Ituha. The construction of the roads will also involve the gutter of water and small bridges of churches, the purchase of two cars for the management of the road, one gas plant and another one of drawing a baby and stones that is known as bold. The second phase of the program will have 14.6 kilometers and it will involve the second road in the Source area and its bus station, road starts at CCM, it was asked to go to VETA until the slaughterhouse, before meeting with the ones that came to Ilemi and heading to the road to the Uyole area and the road of the Provincial Hospital starts at Yyo mini Super Market. The other in the second phase is together with the one starts at the new Forest which will collaborate with the Airport to Sae, Igaissance road starts at Mbeya- Tukuyu, to the Health Center Igwal Secondary School. It is in the second phase, where it will be built at the University of Passengers and goods in the Nane Nane area, a hole of waste in the meaning of DAMPs will be sung, the purchase of a balance of measuring weight in the hole of waste, three vehicles of waste (side loaders), four cars of throwing rubbish (skip Master), 109 containers of carrying the waste (skip bucket), three small cars and collecting 200 rubbish. According to the Director of Mbeya City, in the second phase they will also make pictures of the city's housing (satellite Image) which will help improve the collection of tax collection, and more will be released training to executives about the collection of revenue, and to put a computer system for operations of the council of that city. In that special program of improving the road infrastructure, Mbeya City cannot depend on the only money from the World Bank, but it will build eight kilometers to the tarmac that were using money from its revenue sources. The roads include the Kambarage starts at K's Hospital to the Parents of Meta Hospital and a small bus station of Meta, the road's library, all the roads going to City Park, the roads of Source: Tanu, the third and fourth, visitors Street and Nonde Street, a parking lot from the Sombrero Hotel and the area of City Pub and small bus stations. By using his money, Mbeya city will build ten kilometers of the road to the level of ChangKisarawe where in the year will be installed, whereby it will be the beginning of its sustainable plan of building ten kilometers for tarmac roads every year. Among the long-term concerns in the city of Mbeya, include lack of traffic lights where together with long-term noise from citizens were placed on one road in the city center. However, that problem will remain a history, because it is already a replacement project on the main road of Tanzania- Zambia is complete and lit up. "But I'm not Going to do it.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_12065827 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. What happened to the small elections give Judge Francis Nyalali on the grave on February 27, 1991, the second phase president, Ali Hassan Mwinyi was appointed the commission of the president, to do research and get answers about the requirements of Tanzania, if they want a multi-party system or remain in one party system. That commission led by the former chief justice of Tanzania, Francis Nyalali and worked for a whole year. February 17, 1992, President Mwinyi was given a report about the views and recommendations of the citizens about the system of many parties or one. The answers that were given by the commission of Judge Nyalali is that a multi-party system was rejected by the Tanzanian from 80 percent. In that sense, only 20 percent of them were already in multi-party politics. The youngest of them were not ready for a multi-party system not because they were not wearing me, except they were asked something that he did not know and did not have an understanding about its benefits. Nyalali Commission report shows that the introduction of a multi-political system in 1992, was done to force. A few people who saw the importance of multi-party politics in promoting democracy, they killed many who refused. The father of the nation, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere was one of the people of the front line wanting the nation to move by one party system and inviting many political parties. Even CCM, they told the world Mwalimu Nyerere when he voted for many parties. In summary it is that Tanzania has been threatened to get into a multi-party system. However, many people don't know the importance of many political parties. The results of the small elections on January 22, this year, to make a small parliamentary elections in Dfaith, Zanzibar and 19 wards in Tanzania Mainland to fill the vacant positions from different reasons. The Revolutionary Party (CCM) got great success by winning the parliamentary seat Dfaith and seizing 19 wards, while the Party of Democracy and Development (Chadema) ended up one ward which is round, Bahati, Manyara. What happened in the small election is the one that has added Judge Nyalali worth while in the grave, because it has continued to show that the truth of the amount of 80 percent were not ready for a multi-party system. It has been 25 years since the commission of Judge Nyalali handed the President Mwinyi a report, also this is the 25th year since the system of many political parties that were allowed to allegiance to a few voices. In its 25th year, it seems clear that even the commission of Judge Nyalali would not have done its research now, perhaps the answers would have had, that only 20 percent of Tanzania only have many parties. The results of the elections in 19 wards of Tanzania Mainland, didn't even look at the results of the general elections of 2015 which for approximately 40 percent of Tanzania who voted for the opposition parties for the presidency and members of parliament. The results are not similar to the number of opposition members who are present at the moment which is 32 percent. The results of the small elections have shown CCM to win by 95.2 percent, while the opposition has carrying 4.8 percent. On that logic, 25 years after the establishment of a multi-political system, the situation is worse for the opposition parties. Venezuela seems to have a hard work to do towards the 2020 general elections than it was between 2010 to 2015. The commitment to the 25 years since Judge Nyalali handed the report of its commission, the results have shown that a big problem that puts it in the difficult state of opposition parties in the country is the absence of commitment to the system. The reason for a lack of commitment to a multi-political system is or people not to see the benefits of the system themselves or knowing then to suppress them deliberately so that it does not. Equally in the repeat election, it shows that people don't know the benefits of many parties and they are not ready to remember it. The real situation has shown that a multi-party system is not friendly to Tanzanian politics. Friendship is why many conflicts emerged during election times. The situation wasn't interesting in a small election. 19 wards and one province only have caused a big number, what would it happen if the elections would involve at least five constituencies? Dfaith in Zanzibar the situation was bad. There are complaints that agents of opposition parties, CUF, ACT-Wazalendo and Civilizations were removed from the supervisors of the elections in some stations. The reason for the occurrence is the claim of a number of defections such as the presence of two voters, the presence of voters whose credibility was unprecedented, the faces of other voters were not the same as pictures of the folks. The agents asked when they were released outside. A small elections in one province and 19 wards caused the tear gas to be used by other state forces. Various parts of the country was reported to be the existence of tension between the police and voters of different parties. There is still no understanding there is a problem and it does not concern the ordinary citizens alone. The improvement of the multi-political system is caused by more than two ways; brought up and received. The tradition of citizens depend on how the system itself is raised by the laws of the country. When a multi-party system seems to be an enemy of the dollar, then you will see the citizens fear from it for two hands. When it comes up to support the opposition parties it becomes the same as a dollar competitor, even if people do not like the extent of the opposition parties, they will be afraid. It is a must for opposition parties to be a friend of dollars and friendship with it. Leaders of opposition parties feel free to cooperate with state agencies according to the laws of the country and the agencies, the opposition are not enemies. The multi-political system is in order to make a democratic stadium in a wider election. That instead of one party to stop one candidate then it should be a vote of yes or no, there is an airport to choose. Instead of one party to stop two people then one who gets a lot of votes is the winner, there is a lot of parties that have stopped the candidates with different qualifications and then they say to the voters who are free to choose. A multi-party system was passed and threatened by the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania together with that of Zanzibar. Therefore, it is a system that is a must. Parties are supposed to enter the elections including the same power of participation. The conflict and violence is an indication of inequality. The absence of inequality between parties participate in the elections and the tension between the opposition parties, show the right not to be respected. People are increasing the overall results have shown that in 19 wards that performed in the small elections in Tanzania Mainland, the number of voters had reduced significantly, compared to it was in the general elections of 2015. One example is the Japanese ward, Dar es Salaam whose voters were reduced by more than two-thirds from the previous year. Such a situation has occurred in different areas that made the small elections. In the year 2015, the voters were 16,290 and the elections of January 22, this year, who voted for 5,274 votes. If you took a total of 16,290 as 100 percent, then those who voted for this year is 32.4 percent, in that sense, 67.6 percent of those voted for the 2015 general elections, did not vote last weekend. Together with the parties of CCM, Chadema, ACT Wazalendo and CUF seem to have a good campaign and to encourage citizens, still people do not come out in a good number. Voters have reduced instead of increasing. The decrease in the number of voters in its translations are people to cut up, that they do not have their expectations in voting boxes. When citizens stop voting is a scary thing. Even whoever wins is supposed to wonder the extent of his legitimacy if he has won by a small number of voters.

Doctor Magufuli said that he is forced to take action to fire the work is not that he is cruel, but the aim is to serve the citizens of Tanzania and return the country on the line. He said Tanzania is a rich country, there is no reason for citizens to complain every corner, because there is enough land, all kinds of land, animals from different types of animals that some of them have started to be taken outside. "When I take a step I want to put Tanzania that was tired, I have already said that I have made sacrifices to Tanzania especially the weak," he said. He added that he will not bring down the people of Tanzania and he will not change, he will continue to stand and defend the rights of the poor and all the days he will walk to the poor.

Speaking about President Magufuli's statement that he is not cruel, Doctor James Jesse lecturer at the University of Law of the University of Dar es Salaam, said that the problem is not to be cruel or not, the big thing is supposed to be seen as decisions even if it is right, have to follow the basis of the law. Doctor Jesse said the action of public servants being suspended in public, is the same as encouraging them because they are supposed to achieve decisions they will be afraid to reach the right decisions by fear the pressure of the president. He said that it is good for public servants who are concerned with various challenges, to be followed by public service procedures in order to hold him and not to be removed publicly. John Bayo who is the coordinator of non-governmental organizations in Arusha Province (Angonet), said that for the nation, President Magufuli does not stop violence by stopping the public servants. He said there is a clear mistakes that have cost the nation, which has been made by the servants that even to stop the work they are not enough. "For example, the issue of sugar, people are looking for sugar so that others will not get people who are paying public property, it must be taken to be taken," he said. Hassan Hashi Ahmed, a businessman of Karatu, said President Magufuli does not do any violence, citizens are supporting 100 percent, as he defended the weak. Ahmedi said Tanzania had reached a place in trouble, therefore, it must now be taken to be taken and congratulate the president for good work. Joram Laizer, a resident of Arumeru district, said the president has heard the decision to fire people from work due to identifying irregularities, but he wonders some of the blame from the lack of accountability at other levels of the government. Laizer said the president is taking the action of stopping work is not as cruel, but there are many executives who have a chance to dismiss the work and they have failed to fulfill their authority, or they are responsible for embezzlement or not knowing their responsibility. He said that it has come when the president noted embezzlement, listening to the executive director of the lower level, then those on him who were defending them will release them.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_87178632 Malinzi: What went to Lowassa to do? Jan 23, 2014 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. President of the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF), Jamal Malinzi, has all the rights of having friendship with someone and support him in any good thing. So that the project doesn't use the laws of the country, Malinzi can go anywhere he wants, to meet anyone who wants to speak to anyone. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. But there is a big difference, the biggest difference between Jamal Malinzi, as a private person and Jamal Malinzi as the president of TFF. In Swahili language, we say the difference is like between heaven and land. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. I will give a few examples. Jamal Malinzi can go to the pitch and celebrated a goal when his team Yanga plays. But, as the president of TFF, he is supposed to show that he will not trust him even if he has personal love. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. As a private person, Malinzi can go to a meeting of clubs while wearing a shirt of the club he loves but as the president of TFF, there is a level that he cannot cross in showing his love. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Whenever he did, he is supposed to put the first interests of his institution first before his personal interests. When it comes to the time of choosing between an issue with its benefit and with the benefit of TFF, the president of TFF is supposed to choose the one with the benefit of the institution. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. 'It's a lot of things but with a great impact, very great. That is why, I was surprised by his step of visiting the retired prime minister the day before yesterday and asked him about the strategy of the federation. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The big question that is being asked here is why Malinzi went to explain the plans and strategies of TFF to Lowassa. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Lowassa is not the minister of the Ministry of Information and Sports which at least is working closely with that federation. If Lowassa would be the minister of that ministry, I could understand the aim of Malinzi to go. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Unfortunately, I have not heard if Malinzi has been to the minister of that ministry, Doctor. Fenella Mukangara, explaining to him about the strategies that he has explained to Lowassa. The question is going on, why Malinzi went to a person who TFF does not work with him directly? "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. I would understand a bit of Malinzi as Lowassa would be the chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Social Development which is involved in sports issues. But Lowassa is the chairperson of the parliamentary committee of foreign affairs which in fact has no direct connection with TFF. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. If Lowassa would be a member of the National Sports Council (BMT), I could understand the aim of the tour of Malinzi. But unfortunately, Lowassa has never been a member of that council. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. I say that I would have understood if Malinzi would have gone to meet with President Jakaya Kikwete, because his government is paying the salary of the coach of the national team (Taifa Stars). But Lowassa is a member of parliament and not in government for now. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. If Malinzi has had a problem to meet with the retired prime minister, he is known for loving soccer. Called Frederick Tluway Sumaye and not Edward Lowassa. If he had met with Sumaye telling him about his plans to lift soccer, at least I could not understand. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. That is why I wonder, Malinzi was followed by Lowassa? "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Edward Ngoyai Lowassa who I know I have never seen him in any big soccer match here in the country for a long time now. Basically, when you talk about the names of politicians who like soccer game, the name of Lowassa is not mentioned. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. We see the politicians who come to the National Stadium during the big and small matches of football. Professor Juma Kapuya usually comes to the field. Samuel Sitta is not that he is attending a poem, but he is also one of the sponsors of the Simba Club. I have also seen them in the field, often, Freeman Mbowe and Zitto Kabwe. They like the ball. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Amos Makalla is coming to the field. Mussa Azan Zungu is attending the match. Iddi Azzan is attending the match. Richard Ndassa is attending the match. Juma Next is attending the match. I have seen many times Mwigulu Nchemba attending a match at the National Stadium where the big match will be played. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. I am not sure if Lowassa has been entering the stadium to watch the match even one of the soccer. It is inside my right to say that Lowassa is not a football person. It wouldn't be that, all of us would know because the era of football is not something to hide. That is why, together with holding the highest position in this country, every one who is following soccer knows that Kikwete loves Yanga club. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. On the sidelines of Football, there is no secret. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

Five things that can help you about the time to be close to the child "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Many parents like to be close to children with the aim of building the environment to learn. The challenge, however, is lacking enough time to do so. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. For example, it is normal for parents from home in the morning and go back to night when the children have already lost. The main expectations of work has been a priority and therefore we are using a lot of time to work that primarily are helping us to care for our children. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. However, our important role is making it sometimes we have time to help children with feelings, knowledge and even specifically known as we wish. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. These articles are discussing five steps of taking so that you can help the parent to get time to invest in the upbringing of your children. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Know the kids they need you "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Many parents think they are able to ensure that their children have eaten well, they have been safe, wearing well, they have good health, they have got better schools and get other important needs, then they have finished. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. But despite the importance of these needs, it is good to realize that children are requiring you more. They need to be able to listen to their feelings, anxiety, hopes, to talk to them to know their personal life, their secrets and others that they can't tell other people. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Think about it. If you can get ten minutes a day to stay with your child to listen and give him a chance to talk about you, its meaning between 168 hours that you have for a week, will have succeeded to have a child for a period of 27 days when he becomes the age of 12 / 13!

"But I'm not Going to do it. The scale of the 24 hours we are depending on the priorities we did. The rules are simple. Non-human resource is directed at priority areas. For example, when we go to work ahead, it is clear we will direct some of the time to work. Similarly, in those environments we are forced to reduce the time of doing non-important things. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. That is to say, recognizing the importance of the recovery of a child goes hand in hand and make efforts to make sure you celebrate your time to get time to have a child. Time is made. To put a priority to the family, they will make sure that other things that are not necessary so that you can get a good time to have your family. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. For example, instead of going through the areas that bring together your friends for non-mandatory talks after work, you can go home directly and therefore get time to have your family. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Put family goals "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Try to involve the children and your partner in creating a procedure that will consider the expectations of every family member. When you have a family plan that is understood helps to make the children know how family activities can destroy it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. For many children, for example, remember the birth ceremony, the graduation, the parents' day in school and the embellishments are a permanent memory in their lives. When you remember to bring in these things of those who are in your plans, it helps the children to see you have accidents. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

But, however, there is a practice of losing time at work sometimes without basic reasons. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. For example, many workers can spend a lot of time with no productivity at work. Technology has made it easier to "live" on social media without the need. The result, we will not be completed the work responsibilities for the time set up and the loss of this time loss is due to lack of home. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. In line with not moving the office work home, it is important to remember your duty as a parent from home. Children need to stay with a parent and not a parent who is continuing to be police, manager, teachers or engineer when he is home. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

Social protection is important to deal with our writer, Mwananchi, article @ tz.nationamedia.com you need safe drinking water after destroying it is important for food security because it reduces the possibility of getting bacterial infections or fungus that are causing different diseases including sumves. Sumove is a type of poison that is being constructed and slaughtered or fungus that are in different crops especially cereal like maize, millet, wheat, rice and guidance. The skulls are seen as a fool. The maize is gruered by air pollution, compared to other cereal. Other crops that can be attacked by these fungus, despite grains are together seeds of oil for example nuts, cotton, sunflower and cashew nuts; pepper spray, food, food, inevitable; vegetables and fruits that are not shaken. The animals that eat the skulls usually have the possibility of affecting their crops for example milk or meat. Air pollution may occur before and after harvest and cannot be removed from common ways by cooking for a long time. There are health effects of eating food that include the death of the consumer of that food. Usually, the effects depend on the amount of poison in food that was signed, last time since it can be used, the age and the health of the consumer in general. In August, several people were reported to have lost their lives in Dodoma province after eating food that was believed to have HIV infections while others were hospitalized due to its effects. The effects of a short-term effects include the pain of stomach, vomiting, fever, degedege, not in many blood, yellow, eyes and parts of the body to toe. The person showing these symptoms be taken to the health center that is close quickly. For a long time, summed up can cause cancer, kidney and throat cancer, affecting the immune system of the body and family, affecting the growth of children especially under the age of five. The effects of the economy that is sick as a result of the infection of a gloves causes a reduction in production activities. The burden of medical costs also affects the economy of one person, the family and the nation as a whole. Moreover, the business of crops outside the country which is important in promoting the national income may lose the market if it is known to have a huge amount of summed. A good example is the loss that Tanzania got in the year 2008 after selling 15,000 tons of nuts at 424 million American dollars per tons and was revealed to have a lot of dirt on the type of aflator in. That price was small because of the errors compared to the income which in another country got. South Africa for example, that year changed its nuts at 1,473 dollars in tons. This is because they did not have a huge amount of sumves that could endanger the health of consumers. The advice of the officers at the stadium is important and the farmers should be able to give priority to ensure the crops are taken and taken care of the international standards so as to avoid losses like this that emerged approximately one decade ago. Controlling the gloves, there is a lot of ways to deal with the spread and affecting crops. Most of these ways are made after the harvest of the cereal. To ensure the maize or cereal have been set up well before putting the reserve is one of those ways. Before putting the park, it is advisable to identify the grains involved in order to remove the dirt and keep the poor, torn or attacked by insects. But the farmer can avoid paying the maize or other cereal in soil. Experts advise the use of anja, greenor floors, a clean floor that doesn't have any kind of mouse. Precaution should be taken even at the time of considering various important issues for food security. The store should be clean and with a good weather in all times. Another important thing is to avoid mixed grains of the past and the new ones. It is not reported to mix crops from yields of different seasons for the safety of the concerned food. This helps not spreading infections, if you are in one of the harvest. Wolves are important to be monitored carefully. The experts suggest that those willing to teach him in the new sacks and a Short place where there was not a floor. Drugs for sprinkling in order to increase their lives, you are also important. If it depends on putting the reserve for more than three months, it is advised to get advice from the agricultural expert who are in the report in your area about good storage and how to use it. A reliable source of the literary room is another priority of priority during preservation to avoid infection. The room or the story should have been abducted well so much to remove the possibility of cereal to be rained on. Warnings have seen as a result of mobilization offered by health stakeholders, there has been a huge awareness of people to like eating disorders that do not be exposed or dona. The organizers of these cereal are supposed to be keen during sexual orientation so as to eliminate the possibility of it to the fungus. There are several important things to recognize. To sort out and label them cereal so as to remove the dirt and grains that are attacked by insects is among those ways. The other step is that it is enough of the maize or cereal that you want to listen and run up until it comes well. This helps to make sure that all the animals have been removed before grinding. There is a need to grill cereal, you have come out of the anja, grew or turf to prevent the pollution of fungus that are in the ground if you are believed below. Even after grinding flour a database in the body of greed, torture and allowing them to make it easily. If possible, a tool with a feminist section. However, the scientific report shows how grains is reducing air pollution, so I advise the eating of a stable health. Since the maize and cereal in general is the main food for many citizens in the country, it is good for all stakeholders in the room with the value of food to consider the health regulations to avoid sumves. By considering the best agricultural regulations, ranging from conservation, distribution and processing of maize and its products to reduce the effects that affect the community by eating food and teves, thereby increasing the guarantee of safe life.

October 21, 2016 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The leadership of the Buguruni market have requested the Municipal Council of Ilala to stop bureaucracy and put open revenue that is found due to the collection of tax for traders to the leadership committee of that market so as to improve the infrastructure of that market. Speaking to journalists in Dar es Salaam yesterday, the chairman of the market Said Kondo said that the market has a total of 3,200 business people that were registered officially amid more than 1,000 attackers outside the market who have been doing business without paying tax. He said that action of the council is not clear to the market committee about the income that is found due to tax causes the improvement of the market. "The Buguruni market is facing challenges of destruction of infrastructure due to the buildings, a situation that causes many products in the market to drop the value due to the decade of rain or sun," he said. Moreover, he added that for now the real business situation in the market is not good, many business people have improved economically due to the circulation of money that it is not good. "Now, the prices of products are competitive, traders are selling depending on how they bought so that they get profit, the market is the competition to bring good products that will sell and bring bad products you will get losses and that business from farmers are coming as usual," insisted Kondo. Speaking about the reasons for some of the business people that run their businesses in the market without paying tax, he said that this is due to some of them to take the statement of President Doctor. John Magufuli that he made recently that business people "should not be left to do business. "As a result of this step, I requested the Ilala Municipality adviser to look at the possibility of to also seek official areas for all business people who intervened in the market contrary to the procedures so as to eliminate the existing congestion at the moment, especially considering this market, the window does not withstand the big group of people," said the chairperson.

And Hamisa Maganga, who was in Nairobi to grow in technology has contributed significantly to improve the lives of one person and different nations in the world. But sometimes it can destroy the business of people who are still living in power, which contributes to intolerance. The International Company of taxi cars (Uber), recently found a huge popularity in Africa after causing a fierce conflict between them and taxi drivers in Nairobi, Kenya. When I was in the city for a working tour sponsored by Fastjet Airlines, I found myself in an interview with two rivals - taxi drivers who are used by Uber. In that interview I found a lot of things but the biggest thing is how Uber are ped to pay taxes in that country. The other is how they are throwing taxi drivers who are not normal claiming that they are snow and their cars are high. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The opposition against Uber and technology is common in Kenya, Uber has continued to improve due to attract customers for what they claim that they are paying affordable fares. The issue has made traffic drivers in Kenya's capital Nairobi, complaining and opposing Uber to enter the market. The risk of running those vehicles has been big until the police and the Ministry of Transport in the country was forced to intervene in the ongoing conflict between Uber and taxi drivers. Meanwhile, Uber continues to open branches in Mombasa Town. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The concerns of taxi drivers who are not normal Dogs from technology, says they can't say that Uber is bad because they can't compete with digital change. He says that the business is good because the employed are Kenyans, so if there was a youth who had no work to do, Uber has given the opportunity. "We know the change in the country is good, Uber's cars will consider the client's safety and the driver. "If people see Uber they put a bribe, it's not bad for other techniques to capture customers, they started their website that will help them get customers easily, but if we will continue beating then we should know that we are continuing to announce business without us knowing," says Kurdish. He says that Uber has come with great strength since their daily business has been thrown away from their vehicles and it has been known quickly than other companies that are in that country. He says there are many companies in Kenya that are doing that work but has not received the popularity as it is for Uber. He notes that due to the competition of business that is in that country, now Kenya is no drivers who are not faithful because coming from whom he is doing business is taking a stern action. Speaking about the income he gets in the day through that work, he says it is good though not much. "This business is good and it's paying differences and stay here without work. I would have for a Week I got around 12,000 (equivalent to 240,000 shillings), "he says. And Joseph Egyptians, says Uber is working without having a special station, something that makes the country revenue because they won't be taxed. He says that the business has also constructed the caste in that country because it notes the rich and the poor. "These Uber are good except those who made it wrong, the elderly who want to do this work fail because they can't use smartphones (modern phones). "But we have also inspected the vehicles, that is a car like this (showing off his car) does not work with Uber because its number is A," says Egyptians. He insists that the old vehicles will not be allowed and that they want new cars with number C and D. for example vehicles with number KCW, that is a good that is supposed to work with Uber. He says 50 percent of the owners of vehicles especially taxi drivers who are using their vehicles, an issue that makes it difficult for others to borrow because the criteria and conditions needed is difficult. On his part, Morrison told or, he says that they are working for justice because they pay a different tax with Uber who did not have something in the government. He says the government is supposed to come up with great strategies to ensure that it will improve these two businesses. "If the government wants peace is supposed to stay with us all so that we can talk about one language, or not things must come from poverty and the crime is not done. "We are paying for our colleagues not to pay, they work without any restrictions thus they are changing the business," says Kamau. "He says;" when they came for the first time we shocked the little, they cannot do business easily as they expect, they should be accusing them to know that they are annoying, but not fear this tensions will only happen. He insists that other companies that do work like Uber including Mundo, will TAX themselves have stickers of the council in their different cars and it is for Uber. Speaking about the issue of affordability, he says that Uber are not afforded because they are tired of distance while looking at the kilometers they used, and that if the road is a queue, it is a must for costs. He says that they agree with the customer before they begin the journey, therefore, if it is far, close to the road has queues, losses are usually a customer. "There is no conviction, again you can realize that they are above us. When I get a customer must I will look for a short message so that I can go back and look for another customer, but he can be able to take the procedures again in a different way so that the project has a lot of money, that is our difference, "says Kamau.

Makongo resident in Dar es Salaam City, Oliver Erasto (22) and his child, Emmanuel Macwin (3) have been killed and slaughtered by their bodies abandoned at the Kaole village located in the district of Pwani province. Her husband Oliver, a win of those (26) a resident of Kawe Dar es Salaam, is accused of making the killings after accusing his wife to go and check the progress of construction of houses in the Kaole area with their child. The police commander in that province, Boniveture Mushongi said that the families went to a motorcycle that was driven by the ones. Preliminary reports claim that Mbappe had collaborated with a friend called Rajabu Tuesday (20), a resident of Makongo speaking at the event of the killings. Commander Mushongi said the bodies of the deceased has been reserved for Bagamoyo District Hospital to wait for the doctor's investigation and be identified by relatives. "The initial investigation has revealed the murder resulted from a love of love. The husband was accusing his wife for a long time to have a romantic relationship outside their marriage and a resident of Kawe, "he said. He said in that area where the killings were found in the bag, two mobile phones having two line and the motorcycle that was used for their journey from Dar es Salaam.

I would be Jerry Muro, Now I would do this week ago, the Citizen's newspaper team did an interview with Yanga's chairman Yusuf Manji as two days after being elected to continue holding that position in that club for a period of four years to come in accordance with the constitution. In that interview, Manji spoke about various development issues and advice to the sports sector, politics and economy and giving a note. When I was among the team's team, among the things that I saw him out from his heart is an issue of being shown in the team's matches saying it has reduced the revenue significantly. He said the revenue have decreased since people are waiting to look for the ball in the bar and also in the 'wondering' people were looking for 500 shillings. Manji said it is good for the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) to remain with their contract with Azam and they will not pay many shillings for every match so that they pay them and give them freedom. Manji went further by saying that it has caused a reduction of the cost of fans to go to the field and to reduce the club's revenue. Also, he complained about a few clever thought about the system of selling equipment such as jersey, snow, socks and bukta as a problem because they are making equipment with the logo of Yanga and using them to benefit themselves instead of the club. He said that in a large extent, Yanga has got a loss and forced him to increase 2.5 billion shillings to achieve different issues until winning the premier league championship, FA Cup, participation in the Champions League until the Federation Cup and now is a step of groups. Now, together with that Manji said in an interview, it is possible that it was recognized inside Yanga that there is a loss that has been found and a reduction in revenue. As a result of that situation, what should be done; it was in the mind of a harshman to fill holes in this Confederation Cup matches because it has already been found. For that situation, I would be the information officer of Yanga, Jerry Muro, I would manage this to take place: First, I would advise the formation of a committee to manage this income of people with integrity. You will not like the special cards that will be sold to special people for the purpose of contributing to Yanga and there is a match for the match. The cards would have been sold maybe by 1 million or more that it would also involve themselves as food or drinks, and it is in a special area. Secondly; I would have checked the fee of entries that because running the competition is a cost, those with the middle capacity and they will pay them as 200,000 shillings and they have their approach to their area. There are people who have bitterness for their team, they will pay them. Similarly, other areas can be 100,000 and 50,000 shillings and there will also be special services according to the funds of the people in that area. The area of all, here the entrance could be 10,000 shillings. I know it will be very high, but it is known, entertainment. Even in the European matches, basketball is expected to reach 10 million shillings. Third; we will get people to fill the stadium for the money? I would like to air the favorite radio broadcast, I don't want to tell you, it is known, every time the announcement is in the air as well as on TV, I would go to ask TV or radio sponsorship of those advertisements together with using sports programs to promote more than encing people. Four; Mara after going back, I would record the voices of players and send to radio, he describes himself and says her to encourage fans, even the coach and those who do not know Swahili, I would have secret behind their comments. Five; for a different day, I would have passed the press conference to explain the strategy of Yanga, as well as being defeated, the direction is short, why are they imprisoned and what is done. The last meeting I would have made today Monday, because tomorrow is to write Yanga that he plays with TP Mazembe, the big news I know it will be what I will be said and that will have planned to happen, the procedure of entering and everything related to the match, including those with special cards and special entries and others. Six; I could advise the leadership of Yanga to request the sponsors, Tanzania Breweries Limited (TBL) at least to do 'Road show' by yesterday, Monday and tomorrow Tuesday to Temeke, Ilala and Kinondoni to encourage, encouraging people to come to the field. Saba; I could advise leaders, they will also help at least sports newspapers through sponsors, to announce their products by providing advertisements for the match being adorned with pictures of the players, all is encouraging and inspiring. So, don't I take the stadium? Not only for this match, both matches. You are so many but for those seven, I believe that I will be helping Manji and his leadership and I have fulfilled my responsibility as the information officer spreading propaganda to promote the match and good for the club for the benefit of the club.

"But I'm not Going to do it. In 1959, Fidel Castro left Santiago de Cuba for a long convoy of vehicles to Havana. Nearly 60 years later, his remains were carried out in the same way, by coming back. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Hiba, which will continue to remain the leader is like David and Goliath in the Bible.

That's the issue of charities. But not everyone's dream. And, in fact, not everyone can accept that Fidel was David or Goliath. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. A photo of Castro's regime as David started to be seen during the invasions of Wacuba living abroad sponsored by the United States in 1961, in what had come to be known as Bay of Pigs. This photograph appeared again and again when Fidel was throwing stones and words against her neighbor, the great nation of America while being supported by his close ally in Russia and later Venezuela. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. And it's a photo that some Iranians - those who were impressed with the attraction and his ability to speak which she uses to show that they suffer for now is important as a long way to get a better life later - they have, at least for that time. That was mostly for those who benefited from the original development of the revolution and who lived in Cuba for the development of civilians. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. They fought against the Fulgarian Batista dictatorship in the 1950s and took their lives in the war, continued to defend the revolution.

And these development cannot be forgotten, because it was the fruit of suicide where Wacuba were doing every day. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Many Iranians who were not knowing how to read or write previously were able to learn to study in the campaign that took place after the revolution.

But for many Iranians, the old David of the past turned out to be Goliath with a horrible twist. While Castro pulled the accusations of economic problems of his country to the United States instead of working on those problems with their own policies, some Iranians started to leave the country and went to find new life in the United States. Among his failed policies is the attempt by Castro to urge all citizens of his country to enter the sugarcane estates and start cutting. He wanted all, including doctors and farmers without caring for someone's work, going to the villages to cut sugarcane with the aim of reaching the harvest of 10 million tons of sugarcane, and at the same time insisting that Cuba's honor was at risk. The issue was impossible to reach his goal, and leaving Wacuba were tired and shocked. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. It is clear to many Cuban people who today live in the United States - and many others who have spread across the world, especially in Spain, South America, and Canada - Fidel wasn't David.

If there is an incident that has shaken the nation last week is not a strike of doctors, but it will be kidnapped, tortured by an attempt to murder the leader of that strike Doctor. Stephen Ulimboka. Last night, the nation was ready and the beginning of the strike, the doctors found himself in another twist which has now begun to take it. That, there are people to be among us and people who can do anything to anyone and nothing to prevent it. Contrary to what has been said by Commander Suleiman Kova and a repeat of President Jakaya Kikwete, that the kidnapping is a new issue and it happened to the "first time" the truth is that it has now begun being normal. Whether it is the kidnapping of the political environment or intolerance. In politics we already know three cases that until now the perpetrators are not found. There is a case of the young man of Ubungo who was abducted last night in Igunga District. The young man called Mbwana Masoud disappeared in mysterious circumstances. He had gone to Igunga as one of the lobby of the Party of Democracy and Development (CHADEMA). It was not known where he is up to a few days later, his body was found abandoned with injuries that showed that the young man was shot down before being killed. Are there people doing their dirty tactics? Who will forget the incident of the members of parliament of CHADEMA being attacked on midnight and injured again being alleged in front of the police but nobody was arrested until now? What people have the courage of attacking members of parliament with swords without having some security behind them? Who is the security guards? An attack on the Doctor. Ulimboka indeed confirms that the phrase of evacuation of a person's meat doesn't go to the academic. The person has not tasted it, he would want to eat again. I believe there are people who have already lost this blood of activists and they can't stop. And because these people seem to qualify in the way of suffering and thinking that we should not expect the wrong people to be left active as it was to the Doctor. Ulimboka. This thirst of killing people is not new in our continent, nor the other parts of the world, especially where the leaders have no argument to defend themselves more than using force. Who will forget about Steve Biko in South Africa? It's not with him he was an activist who will lead young people to demand their rights to discover themselves who they deserve. Isn't it that the Cameroonian government saw him as their greatest enemy because he is sharing the minds of the people? She is not the one who was arrested in the hands of the police after being given a glimpse and suffering? Who has forgotten that Robert Ouko in Kenya whose body was found has been burnt - again this is getting a minister? People say the Julius Nyerere regime was a dictatorship. There is someone who can show someone who was born or a sequel of people whose bodies were hurt by suffering because the government or a group of people had been threatening. Oscar Kambona, Abdallah Fundheard, Kasanga Tumbo and others of Nyerere's opponents have lived and saw old age! Is today the youth in this style will see old age? Or all will have to be in exile to be safe? "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Even if we accept the theory that all these actions (including Arumeru East) are made by hooligans, can we believe in any way that our government is prepared to deal with it? We have forgotten how the Albinos are being abducted and brutal and how it took time to our government to control those acts? More than 40 albinos have been killed and all have happened under the leaders of those - Kikwete State House, Mwema, as IGP and Rashid Othman as the head of national security. Who is thinking that this group will be able to control those acts of kidnapping. If I say that there is a possibility of other people to be hijacked again and that I'll be looking at or see from what happened and be able to reach a conclusion that we do not have a great ability to deal with these actions? What has raised more, and it seems that our citizens seem to accept, it is that crime issues are reduced to the commission. Some were against this since the EPA but now it seems to have been accepted that the crime helped the commission! But what is annoying more than those who are suspected to be involved are the ones who are ami for the commission! Isn't we seen in Songea? We saw Tabora? But why don't we learn and realize that the country will not be taxed or directed by the commission? If the commission would lead the country there would be no ministers or various institutions that have been formed to do what the commission could do. The commission is required to be formed by an independent body, it is impossible, for example, the police will be allowed to participate in crime and then the police should be in the commission especially if the ones being mentioned are top officials of that army. The commission of that way is the peak of the usion of the leaders. But the most terrible thing is that if it is true, there are people that are used by others to do things like this and it takes more than one week to the police to think to arrest anyone, then the threat of our national security is bigger than we can think. Think if it would have been affected by that issue is the minister or head of the province. Just imagine that one of the famous ministers that he disappeared and his morning was found in Mabahill bin taabani, kang is married and overnight have been married. Imagine if police and security had been a response that we have shown. Can it take five days or the creation of the commission? Truly the response of the president would be like this? "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Or let's go ahead more - imagine who has gone to this way is a child of one of the national executive leaders who is mentioned to have been mentioned in the media or is involved with certain things. Then he was found in a condition that he's been found in the Doctor. Ulimboka, this is not the whole country we were told to find those who did that act? Actually, I think the feelings of some people that "the leader of the hunger strike" would be the same for the great child? This is a Doctor. Ulimboka reminds us that the corrupt people are not taboo. They should be corrupt in the government or outside, they do not know what to do. And because this is true I assure YOU that this is a Doctor. It is not the last one. Little and it will go above. These who have fun will find themselves and complain. It should be remembered that witches are killing the children of their colleagues and they will be required to kill them. And it's like those who like spilling the blood of other people. The day will come and that of them will be dropped as well. It is not written in a place that a living in Upanga will die in Upanga? Not to do it easily and think a Doctor. Ulimboka kicked off. If his life will be threatened because of this because he was hurt, then you need to know unless we live in different times. At times that there is no longer trust and everyone is to praise him even if it is one brother. It is not the same time to live in a "peace, unity, stability and solidarity." If they have been able to do this to a famous person like Doctor. Ulimboka, they can do with anyone else; if they have been able to do a lawsuit, it should be remembered even the people will undergo. The great thing is to look at the stories they will make sense for several times now the famous story is "was walking with a person's wife." If people think and believe these statements are provided quickly, then we have a big problem because our killers are sitting on us. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

However, he admitted that in that country there has been a security problem through small rebel groups who often have been doing attacks, including kidnapping of people and thanking the government of Tanzania for being one of the countries that have taken its troops to help restore peace in that country. On his part, President Magufuli admitted that the state of Dar es Salaam port has changed due to the great efforts that the fifth phase government has allowed including removing all servants who contributed to destroying the environment of the port. "It's true in the past years, there were people that saw them are gods, they abused their power, tortured until putting money in their cars without caring for the interests of Tanzania. I assure you Honorable President Kabila in the fifth term, things like this will never happen, "he insisted. He said among the things that he spoke with that president, he has agreed to increase the participation of DRC to pass its cargo because up to now DRC has succeeded to increase the cargo that goes through the port of Dar es Salaam by 10.6 percent. He said in addition to removing the bureaucracy problem in that port, the government has reduced the payment of restrictions to the business people that pass their belongings in the country by reducing the number of funds to inspect goods and reach three balance, that will be in Vigwaza village, Coast Province, Manyoni, Singida Province and the Nyakahura in Kagera province. "But I have also told TPA that they have agreed to remove the business people of DRC by adding time to put their cargo from the port from 14 days to 30 days," he said and added that in improving the business environment in the country, the government is also in its budget for the year 2016 / 17, it has set aside a total of one trillion shillings for the construction of modern railway that will be connected from Burundi to Isaac which will also reduce transportation costs for the business people of DRC. In addition, he asked President Kabila to follow and take action against all those who are reported in the tax and customs unit of the DRC for bureaucracy in order to create more environment between those two countries. Regarding the oil contract, President Magufuli said the agreement between DRC and Tanzania, will make easier the fuel that will be found in the Lake Tanganyika being transported through a pipeline that is being constructed for fuel from Uganda to Tanzania. Speaking about the issue of defense and security of DRC, Magufuli said in his conversation with President Kabila, has confirmed to him that in that country there is a security situation and that the government is prepared to ensure that the elections are taking place in peace and follow the foundations of democracy. "For now, they are in the registration process in the voters' register, because this country is expecting to have a total of 45 million voters in the last elections, 35 million people have registered to vote for votes," he said. In addition, he said that he has accepted the request of the president of wanting to follow the peace situation in that country and noted that through his position of the chairperson of political parties, defense and security of SADC (Troika), has ordered ministers of foreign affairs from three countries to evaluate the real security assessment in the country. He said those ministers who will go to DRC is the minister of foreign affairs from Tanzania, Angola and Mozambique. In addition, President Magufuli said in his talks with President Kabila, he has explained his intention of wanting the DRC to join the East African Community and asked him to present his official letter so that it can be discussed by other members of that community. President Kabila launched the foundation stone of TPA building, popularly known as one stop center, that will be used to provide all the port and TRA services. According to the executive director of TPA, Deusdedis Kakoko, the building of 35 apartment building is the last long building in the East and Central African countries. "But I'm not Going to do it.

For a period of months and several weeks now, as a nation we have continued to hear news (which have been there for many years) about the growth of drug trafficking. That this business is mature and having a big network in the country is a clear truth. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. There are facts or issues, which doesn't need to have a degree to any Tanzanian to recognize; it is known and if it works will be a great move to overcome this disaster. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. First, the true truth is that for now, drugs is a problem that has affected many Tanzanians especially the youth. In the streets of cities such as Dar es Salaam, Arusha, and Mwanza and several other cities, for a person who is confusing and different kinds of people will realize how many people were using these drugs. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. As he said a musician who has ever seen a lot here in the country, Rehema Chalamila, popularly known as Ray C when he made an interview at Clouds TV station recently, many people have been affected by drugs and drugs. There are students of different levels like secondary and universities, business people, artists, workers and many others, including the most respected people in the community. Some are known, while others are doing a lot of attention. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Despite that, more than 200 people have been jailed and even sentenced to death in countries such as China and Hong Khon (according to various media houses in the country and internationally) after the arrest of drugs is an illustration that the situation is bad. The victims of all these are brothers, sisters, aunt, and our brothers; and it has been a great shame for our nation. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The second truth about the tragedy is that there is a lot of gays among the many Ugandans in this disaster. That, there are a lot of pressures on this issue to an extent that even those who have good intentions in the fight against this disaster are broken. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. For instance, those with interest in this business have been using propaganda in various platforms, such as media and government agencies to spread the idea that fighting this disaster is very dangerous! In this, it is used to examples that the business situation has reached out to be a very big network, to the extent that the anti-fighting can even lead to the government! "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Those spreading these propaganda want to prove to the public that the situation here is like in other countries like Mexico and Columbia. In these countries, by taking appropriate measures early to deal with the growth of this business (if it is continuing to improve here), has caused the situation to be bad. In those countries, the networks of this business is big involving many big leaders in the government, the presence of groups or "army" (outside the government, for the purpose of protecting the interests of this business) and people with great financial and influence. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. With the aim of weakening the fight against this business in the country, they have dared to involve the deaths of some people as a result of the people "living in front of the tragedy. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. In general, even if there are true cells in these allegations, what is clear is that they are used propaganda and many claims to be able to weakening the many efforts undertaken by the disaster. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Moreover, these propaganda is sarcastic to various government agencies, and even the Tanzanian community in general because they have the aim of showing that the participants of this business are about the law and that they have reached the move of not touched by any authority. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Another truth about this disaster is not responsible for leaders in different levels, in the fight against this problem. Normally, as several people are concerned with the authorities in ministries and departments (with direct connection with this issue or otherwise) such as immigration, police, national security and others but the situation remains critical, this raises several questions. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. It is possible that those authorities are among those who benefit from this business, and therefore participating in removing it is equal to cutting the flow of their benefits. Or, they may be not benefiting enough but it is apathy and not fulfilling their responsibilities accordingly that is causing the maturity of this business. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

In addition, he urged them to ban all shops that will be known to sell medicine for use and take action against its owners so as to stop the behavior of those business people who are cooperating with the workers of the health department to steal medicine. Mpenda has given that directive while inspecting various shipments of drugs that were purchase by the health department, that will be distributed to the clinic and all health centers together with the renovation of a special storage room at Madaba Health Center. According to him, the health department has a legal responsibility to ensure that every owner of the medicine shop is focusing on the law, regulations and procedures that are available for selling correct medicine for human use and avoid selling drugs that are required to be in the clinic, health centers and government hospitals. He said that step will help to save the lives of citizens who are a big economic pillar, because without good health there is no work of production that can be done, something that is dangerous to the economy of that council. He said, some of the owners of the shops have a dirty game of selling counterfeit drugs, an issue that can contribute to poverty because the citizens when they buy those drugs are unable to heal and cause a citizen to use another amount of money to buy medicine which could take them to other services. The chief physician of that council, Doctor Mustafa Minister said that for now he is proud to see in the clinic and all health centers in Madaba Constituency there is no shortage of medicine.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_95188551 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. For Zanzibar not a magnitude, even Uskochi are Jun 01, 2012 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Last week, first Minister (first Minister, rank which is as Prime Minister) of Uskochi, Alex Salmond, launched the campaign of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP) to mobilize the "No" in the referendum (opinion polls) for freedom of this country that is expected to take place in the future. Uskochi's argument with Britain (in the sense of what is called the United Kingdom of great Britain-England, Uskochi and Wales- and Northern Ireland) has been upset for a long time and has got more strength after Salmond and SNP came into power in 2007. Basically, the main policy of that politician and his party was to ensure that ultimately Uskochi is building away from England. When he came to power, the SNP explained that they have a plan to make a referendum to hear the reactions of Somkochi about the idea of secession. However, an obstacle that they have been facing, since the beginning is the fact that despite the differences here and there, it is difficult to sketch the line to divide the Sunchi and other Britons. The clashes in nearly every aspect of life makes these people become one more than different. And while preparing this post, Salmond has got a "bad news" from the prosecutor's opinion) popular here in England, Peter Kellner, President of YouGov's referendum. According to Kellner, a referendum conducted by YouGov last Friday shows that while only 33 percent of Somkochi want "freedom" (secession), 57 percent want Uskochi to remain part of England. The opinion prosecutor has warned Salmond that "he has a long mountain to climb" to reverse the majority of the Somalans about their country's secession and Britain. Likewise, he explained that there are "several threats that can contribute to many people to oppose the idea of secession, and he gave an example of arguments like investors to withdraw from Uskochi (in lack of sure if Uskochi will decide to use the currency after secession, Britain can start a crime (austerity measures) that will affect the economy of Uskochi. In addition, Salmond has publicly revealed that other fear that threaten Sunchi to support the idea of secession is together with the high cost of running the country (especially during this period where the world's economy is known) such as sustaining a full force, embassy offices and the cost of running public service institutions (Civil service). Basically, in any exercise of voting, the state of not sure or fear of "in front of how it will be" enough to make many voters decide to remain in the party or the current structure (if it is a referendum on certain thing). This strategy is being used by the ruling party (including CCM) in the elections where the message is like "we are not in the bowl." (In the meaning of the party you know is better than what is promising only without having the active examples of the leadership of the country). However, Salmond and SNP are continuing with their efforts while making sure that the great wealth of Uskochi (there are oil in the North Sea) will enable them to afford the cost of running the country if Somkochi will agree with the idea of separation with Britain. Meanwhile, Uskochi, at the end of the week at home has been faced with sad news where the protest against the coalition in Zanzibar turned into a massive riots. As I explained in my message of Global Voices articles (audio Messages, that can hear here http: / / goo.gl / r6ngT), the riots in Zanzibar and the whole issue of union is supposed to be monitored with a broader view. Personally, I see that the origin of the problem of the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar is its founders, that is the late father of the nation Mwalimu Julius Nyerere and Abeid Karume. Here I request it should be understood. The idea of the coalition was good for considering different reasons, the largest, as the closeness of the roots of the mainland and the Island. But the problem that maybe was contributed by the political environment at the time, Nyerere and Karume thought that their consent was representing the consent of the people of Zanzibar. There is a "wisdom" one of the English saying that "a good thing is not a must to be beneficial. For example, while giving a lot of food to a hungry man is a good thing but his results can lead to even the death of a hungry man who threatened to get a lot of food. " Yes, eating a lot of food is dangerous, and that is why people pass away or they have not seen a long time begins food to a hot drink (ridge or tea). Now, the idea of the union was good but not to get the consent of many that is where you are there now. For a long time there has been complaints about the union, especially among the people of Zanzibar. The main argument has been that they are broken, they are oppressed and the others are going further and claimed the aim of the union was "to grow Zanzibar." Unfortunately, the politics of Zanzibar have a difference in a certain level and in the mainland. In the Island, religion has a unique opportunity in politics. So, most of the political issues can also carry religious sentiments, something that without crime can negotiate. I would like to insist that together with the dangers that can come out in mix religion and politics, experience and history have shown that the wisdom and the interests of the community being placed in front of personal feelings, religion may not have effects in politics. In the United States, for example, religion still has a unique opportunity. Perhaps the best example of how religion can not destroy politics is Germany where the Kansela Angela Merkel (Christian Democratic Union-CDU) is a Christian. Cold is the largest political party in the nation. Likewise, the ruling party in Turkey, Justice and Development Party, AKP, is a Muslim party. However, that party has succeeded to make Turkey continue to be a non-religious nation. Even here in the United Kingdom, the Queen who is the head of the country (respect) of the Anglican church, and although Christianity is as a "national religion" but the country is run by a "global religion" and not religious. However, the problem of religion is the fact that despite touching the personal feelings of believer, religious issues do not require scientific confirmation (or global). Unlike religion, politics is the issue of more ideology than faith (although faith in ideology can make the supporters of the party see the importance of religion). Likewise, religious issues include "future life after all of the world" while politics is focused on current issues or not here in the world. The tragedy comes when a believer in religion starts to believe that he is against the coalition, for example, he is doing spiritual work and get the creator. It is difficult to control this kind of person because even his movements broke his life, or threatened to die, he believes that he will be paid by his creator. Basically the violence that happened in Zanzibar have been contributed by our politicians who significantly have been talking about what is known as "fear of the founders of the union when the coalition is being ignored in their hands." Instead of dealing with the problems of the union and get solutions to permanent solutions, our leaders have been focusing more on trying to tell us that they are dealing with it because they have refused to know about it. We have had a Commission of coalition nuisances for the years to go back but its effectiveness has become more provocative than the reality. Let's stop the hypocrisy, "noise" for demanding the change of the coalition structure (and even those to be released) cannot be.... to ignore or have a "eternal commission" to address those problems without solutions. But another is to suck on the Zionists, hatred against their colleagues on the excuse of the problems of the union. In Zanzibar, a number of politicians have dared to claim that they are going for the people of Zanzibar to miss employment. But that is just a sequence of accusations of that kind, because in the past they have been accused of being the ones that led to AIDS in the island. Because until this time I am preparing this article, the situation in the island has not changed, I request I conclude by giving a proposal on the importance of having a referendum that will compensate the offense that was done in the past to look for the consent of the citizens about the union. If the referendum will decide to have three governments, then that should be. If it is decided that the coalition should be done, then it should be that (by the way, the breath of the coalition does not mean to die in Tanzania Mainland or Zanzibar, as the breath of marriage doesn't mean the death of the husband or wife who was divorced with his colleague). Finally, when I urge our leaders to speed up the referendum I believe it will help to bring a lasting solution to the problems of our union, it is very important for both the two governments (the union and of Zanzibar) to take a stern action against the terrorists who sell "legitimate claims about the union" that the reason for attacking them and burning churches and its properties. They do not make these criminals not to look for a drawn coalition but like the seeds of religious tensions between Christians and Muslims. God bless Tanzania "But I'm not Going to do it.

The translations of a translation is an act of making certain information from the original language written to the language. The translation is usually with the aim of trying to transfer the message, meaning and all the communication of communication and communication from different languages. This is not easy even though, and the proof is reditation that a few translations available today in the world, especially mid-mid-fielder, are unprecedented. So, it seems that in order for a translation to be done in its authenticity, several things must be noted: First, a secret must be made for both the languages, meaning the language and the language is targeted; not in the ability to make a character and pair of communication, but also the ability of emotional and cultural ability. The ability to make a character is to make a sentence that is correct and it is acceptable in the use of the language itself. And the communication capacity is for someone to present his idea and understood. However, sometimes a person can be known in communication although his statement is not correct to a character, the application and culture. The application's ability is to ensure the use of the language that he uses certain language structure in accordance with the taboo and traditions that are acceptable in certain languages. Second, if possible, the best to be given to this skills of translations on the basis of interpretations and especially theories. In addition, the secret should have been going through and heard in different theories and knowing what methods; in which way and what translations is to meet certain translations. Third, the secret is supposed to understand especially the aim of translating some work so that he can choose the type of translation needed in the implementation of his work. Four, the secrets will also be able to test the cultural and social space that is among the two languages that they have used. This is important because there is a great opportunity between the two cultures of those languages, that's when it becomes difficult to get good and real translation as required. But as a communication tool stems from a source of certain culture and that's also an illustration of the Community. Because different communities are different from the culture and therefore, it must be the difficulty of translating one report to the other. Watch for example how it would be difficult to transmit these statements from Swahili to English: "Lila and fila will not be peaceful," "Mgalla muue and his right to pe," "the grandmother of a lot of salt" and "broken me." In this situation, an article or literary report becomes more difficult to translate, in terms of literature very closely with the culture of people and so they ask a lot of statements that explain the shape of the culture. Isitosit, literature as any art, has a creative direction and emphasis on rappers. It does not say it does not say it does not say, therefore it's the dark. First, the secrets are forced to detonate a trap of mystery and the puzzles that is set by the author of the literary work; and then he will get a word or the right phrase and the right thing is close to the puzzles of language. That is why we add a good translation of Fortunatus Kawegere of Animal Farm, Wanyama and the translations of Julius Nyerere of Julius Cumer - Julius Kaisari and Merchants of Venice-Mabepari of Venus. Art is clear that the translation of the work of artwork needs a secret to a certain extent, to be keen or collaborating closely as the artist was writing. But maybe the question would be asked: Is the translations? Why should the people be able to find a word or a statement from one language until without doubt the importance of a translation that was discovered in the past. Think about the issue of spreading and spreading information in the world of today that has been like a village because of globalization. They are also changing ideas, culture, science, technology and different solution that require translation. But perhaps the most important thing here is a translation in education. Swahili language will be the language of education in our education system one day. Then we will take a secret of education books from different languages that park knowledge and different professions of education. Undoubtedly you will receive the need to be the champions of translation well for the purpose of developing Swahili language as well as a common language of Kiswahili. alex.ngure @ ioo.com "But I'm not Going to do it.

We have discussed the issue of corruption and it has come to it clear that the expectations of citizens cannot be achieved in the environment and the style of dealing with the concerned problems that has been in use. In the 1980s, the former Prime Minister Edward Sokoine appeared to be successful in attending "middlemen" and "economic sabotage." But the system used to address the problem was a basic shortage that led to even some of the "economic crimes" to be proven to have been treated. And there was also a problem of creating certain permanent views in the relevant circumstances.

I remember the day the terrorists stormed two hotels in India the way the head of the anti-terrorism unit was a victim; he wore a metal cap, a tweet to prevent bullets and expression inside the hotel. She was killed in a shot. TV showed the time he had to join his young people to get into one of Taj Mahal hotel, and just after the police help to remove his dead bodies. I still remember the head of the whole American fire unit on the 11th of September as a victim of one of the victims in the ground. The head of the soccer club was found inside the building when it was collapsed. These events confirm the behavior of a citizen showing its great love for the national interests and the greatest gift than his soul. Can we still be convinced there are reasons to make sure that all Tanzanians should have love with their country at all times, in any environment, without themselves or questioning the validity of their love? Can we prove to us that those who have given bail to make great decisions on our behalf as citizens have a true love with this country to the extent of being ready to volunteer in the broader public interests? How many of those who have given bail have proved in their actions, without themselves or turning into it, that they have a patriotic patriotism and whoever in the eyes of the public? And if their actions are influence we are questioning their patriotism there are reasons that make them get stuck in the form of qualifications to represent or lead them? Is it a different form of view or look at the basis that makes us feel free? Are those who passed on the measure of patriotism is things or things (values) which give them the strength of love and appreciate their country? Will they also love and appreciate their country all the time and in any environment without themselves or turning into it? Are these different reflections among the diverse groups in our society today indicate what? What is the thing that gives the group the inspiration of them to believe they are right and we must protect us in the war that began under the hashtag? While we continue to discuss various issues that concern the nation, there is a slow fire in our society. We have not discussed this fire with the necessary weight. There are already people who have started to be remanded in the form of view. And the situation is now not very different from how it started in Rwanda when the citizens decided to be able to face the box that brought him to each other and its origin. Today, Tanzania has already been identified that they are a certain group. And almost every Tanzanian will be forced to be forced (or forced) to get into certain group depending on the position or personal interests. It is not the aim of this column to be predicted, but there are indications that currently there are groups of Tanzania, it will be addicted to the extent that it is impossible to be lack of conspiracy to begin to finalize. And when the order to finalize will reach a place to solve certain characters, this country has officially closed the page of his peace book. There are two major things to happen. The first one is that we as a nation to sit down with our differences, among the primary and those of using the stomach, we need to discuss how things that make us need to be Tanzania and why should we believe that we will be ready to fight for even remaining. In this discussion, we make sure that we promote transparency and good intentions to appreciate the first country instead of holding onto the groups and interests, it is not happening. But this debate doesn't end up in talks. To an end by creating our constitution to put it clear that no human being will be allowed to play for. This debate will ensure that we go back to our curriculum from nursery up to universities to invest in children and our youth, the national basis and dignity of humanity so that the work of corruption should not be great as it is. The second thing, which we request that it will end aside, it is that we will continue to stimulate the fire of hatred and tensions that we have decided to build among us because of our selfishness and we will go to a place we shall begin to lie. In this second issue, every group will be led by a good victory, then we will have taken this country in trouble. History will put a very humiliating memory of our contribution to define this country. To ask Theoneste Bagosora who was found guilty of organizing a mass murder in Rwanda.

Citizens rights are important, they deserve to live and are predicted to be involved in poaching of elephants in order to get them to the law. That operation was done by several M-four officers in the past four years, the government started operation to fight against the presence of national parks and national parks, the citizens force and special wildlife force that were given instructions of that work. Unfortunately, the training and instructions didn't help them; the police failed to make good citizens and criminals - all of them were placed in a single source of poachers. As a result of some of the officers not from the criminals and those who are not criminals, not following justice or using the law during the operation, people found in possession of livestock and who were running agricultural activities in the park were arrested; they were harassed and some were killed. Not only that, the livestock that was arrested was banned for several days without being given leaves or water. It is sad to see that despite the incident that was attacked and caused four senior ministers to resign, other soldiers, this time of Suma JKT have killed four people and injured five others. The police who had been in the forest of Meru district in Arumeru District, Arusha Province have led to the deaths of those people after beating the fire bullets in an event to arrest their livestock and take it to the government's government. Apart from the four breeders being killed, five colleagues including a 13-year-old child who is in class three at the Oldonyosexual Primary School were injured by fire bullets. The child Isaiah Thomas (13) who was supposed to be in the classroom continuing with his studies and his colleagues are now fighting for his life in the hospital after being shot in the back of what is claimed is violence between breeders and Suma JKT who had been in the forest of Meru. Thomasa who was admitted at the Mount Meru Hospital has been transferred to KCMC Referral Hospital after his condition worsened. The doctor who was listening to says that the child started showing signs of producing, starting from the legs to the legs due to the bullet that was shot seen to be deadly, thus requiring more treatment. The situation now causes the future of the life of that child to be volatile. Likewise, that situation causes the government to cater for the treatment of that child. We advise that soldiers are being sent to arrest the livestock or people on claims of getting into areas that are not allowed to comply with the law, caring for justice and protecting the life so that the suspects should be released by the law. The police should follow the law and arrest criminals by taking them to court instead of taking them to the law and caused the deaths of civilians. We know that the work has its own challenges; some criminals have made good citizens or others pretending that they want to help the police but they have turned out and cause their effects. If that is known then the police must increase professionalism to deal with all kinds of criminals so that they are forced to use a bullet to have the legitimacy of doing so. We advise fire bullets to be used only after first using rubber bullets, shooting in the air and firing tear gas. However, we advise the citizens to stop taking care of the law in order to deal with the soldiers because by doing so they can be able to bring the effects including death.

There is no one to ask them what he did. Now because there are many people that don't like to work but with luxury life in the umbrella of pedejee, they saw the situation even if the pedejee is in their property (public domain).

Written by John Gagrisk, Kibaha "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Published: 25 November 2016 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. President John Magufuli has disclosed the secret of his step of disappointing the board of directors of the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA). "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. He has said that he was forced to take that step after the board approve 26 billion shillings to be taken to a special account in several business banks. That board gave permission to be taken to those funds in those banks while there is a directive by the president of banning public institutions, public organizations, government departments, agents and ministries to put their money to commercial banks. Those funds are supposed to be opened in the Tanzania Central Bank (BoT). Last Sunday in the morning, the State House announced that Doctor Magufuli broke the board of directors of TRA, and a few hours he appointed the deputy commissioner general. The State House without explaining the reason, it said that President Magufuli has dismissed the appointment of the chairman of the board of directors of TRA, Bernard Mchomvu, and taking it to the whole board. Moreover, in addition to taking that board, he appointed Charles Lugere to be the deputy commissioner general of TRA, to fill the position that was open for one year after Doctor Magufuli to revoke the appointment of the former president of that position, Lusekelo Mwaseba. "The appointment of another chairman of the board of directors of TRA and the board of that authority will be announced later," explained the State House statement released on Sunday morning. According to the report of this year of TRA, members of the board that were appointed in the year 2014 and were asked to serve until the year 2017 and the areas that were working when they were appointed in brackets is Shogholo Msangi (assistant commissioner of policy, Ministry of Finance), Khamis Omari (secretary general, Ministry of Finance, Zanzibar) and Doctor Philip Mpango (as the secretary general of the commission of planning). For now, Doctor Mpango is the Minister of Finance and Planning. Others are Professor Beno Ndullu (the Governor of the Central Bank of Tanzania (BoT), Assaa Ahmad Rashid (secretary of the Ministry of Constitution and Law Zanzibar), Josephat Kege (member of parliament Kalambo - Rukwa), Doctor John Mduma (senior lecturer, department of economic research and policy at the University of Dar es Salaam - UDA), Doctor Nsubso Isaga, (lecturer of Mzumbe University), and Rished Bade (with the Commissioner General TRA). The secretary of that board was Juma Bannon (TRA). Bade suffered from that position. While addressing yesterday at the 31 graduation of the University of Huria Tanzania (OUT) at the headquarters of the university, Bungo, Kibaha district in the Coastal Province, Doctor Magufuli said that he had traits the board as a result of violating the procedures. He explained that their action to approve those funds to be put in different banks, is different from the instructions since that was the game done by institutions and organizations. "Now I don't know if the University of Huria and you have been putting the progress of development in Fixed Deposit Account, (a special account) but that's been the game, the day before yesterday we have found funds a total of 26 billion shillings that were given by the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) for the use of TRA, were taken to three banks like Fixed Deposit Account and the TRA Board has passed, that is why I received the information, money I took by the board by happy. "Even at the moment the minister (education, Professor Joyce Ndalichako) is here, the Tanzania Education Authority (TEA), which was established for special reasons, is allocated money when there are their money they have imported the Fixed Deposit Account, that minister is a message sent and Delivered," insisted President Magufuli. He said that there has been a game of heads of different institutions to take money and put them on a special account where the government goes to borrow at a high cost. "For now, this is the game that is played and causing the government to lack money, an issue that the government is not ready to see the misuse of its funds," explained Doctor Magufuli who is known for insisting to restrict government expenditure and are disgusted with the violation of government operations. He said this game has been giving the government a high cost because of borrowing money in the bank at a high cost and misleading the availability of revenue. "I request that you will continue removing them because the country reaches a place in trouble where they can hold sessions even in Europe and due to this trauma, it has increased from 1.2 trillion and to 1.8 trillion where the economy has improved," explained Doctor Magufuli. He said the economy has improved and you are supposed to take by 7.2 percent, but until the quarter of this year has grown by 7.9 percent and that one of the countries whose economy is growing rapidly, which among five countries has been the second after Ivory Coast. In addition, he said that the value of money has risen and that the ones that are talking about money is those who are sharing a deal that for now they don't have a chance.

A shame that hit the coffee industry, complaints from tea and tea farmers at a small level in the country following the news that they will get a small bonus from Chai Kenya Council, KTDA, it has proved clear the problems affecting the water sector in the country. KTDA bought one kilograms of tea in 14 shillings and then later on the end of the financial year to provide additional payments known as bonus. They couldn't buy tea and get the second payments depending on the amount of leaves that they took to the factory and the financial ability of the factory that lead the leaves. The payment of tea farmers around 560, 000 people across the country were blocked from between 24 and 35 shillings last year to 8.50 shillings and 16 shillings this year. A total of the funds that were set aside for those payments and KTDA also reduced to 44 percent from 35.6 billion shillings last year to 19.8 billion shillings this year. The chairman of the small-scale farmers' party, Rift Valley, Joel Chepkwony says that the minimum amount of bonus this year was caused by the highest number of directors of KTDA. Mr. Chepkwony describes the directors and "shootes" while wondering why 455 directors were paid millions of money to manage 65 industries in the country, while farmers continue to receive low payments. "Is it a must we have seven directors in every factory of Labour for KTDA? That is a big burden for farmers because every director receives a payment of approximately 1 million shillings each year. We don't need many directors, "said Mister Chepkwony. At the same time, Mister Chepkwony calls for the Minister of Agriculture Felix Kosgey to intervene and reduce the number of directors in every factory to stay at two, explaining that this will reduce the cost of running industries so that more money can be paid to farmers. KTDA runs 64 industries on behalf of 54 cold tea companies that are run directly by tea farmers who are shares. Abraham Rotich, an accountant of KTDA in the scene and destruction, denies the claims that the organization caused tea prices at an international auction in Mombasa (Mombasa Auction). Mister Rotich clarified that KTDA had equal rights and other business people who are selling and bought at the auction and therefore it did not have any authority to decide the price of tea. "The price is decided by the international direction, as well as the needs and demands of customers who want to buy tea. It can also be affected by the level of change of dollars, "he adds. The tea sector in Kenya has been faced with various problems that are seen to be caused by not strengthened the markets of foreign countries that have been executed by political conflicts or weakening the economy. Kenya is leading the world in the sale of tea in CTC (Cut, Tear and Curl) in the international market, considering that it contributes 22 percent of CTC sales in the world. The major marketing of tea in Kenya is together with Egypt, England, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sudan, Russia, Yemen and United Arab Emirates (UAE). About the bonus, however, in the areas where tea leaves in the country, various manufacturing and tea factories have provided different levels of additional payments. In the county county, Momul County issued an extra paycheck in the south of Rift Valley, being 15.25 kilograms, with other industries like Litein, Kapkatet and Tegat paying 12 million farmers and 14 Sheps. The cold tea factory of Ogden in the Kisian county paid the lowest bonus in the country, with 8.5 kilograms of kilograms, while the Imenti, Meru led to 26 shillings. What is the solution to these problems? During his visit to the city in a few months ago, the secretary general in the Ministry of Agriculture Sicily Kariuki admitted that the tea sector in the country has faced various challenges. Miss Kariuki expressed his concern that less than five percent of the whole amount of tea being constructed in Kenya was being used by its citizens, while 95 percent were sold in foreign markets. He says that the government will continue to look for new tea markets in the world while recognizing that tea is one of the crops that pay the country's headquarters of foreign money. Last year, tea shares this country 11.5 billion shillings in foreign sales and 22 billion shillings in the country. However, the high cost of tea production in the industry has been linked to the reduction in the income of the farmers of tea leaves, and thus making different industries for making tea to look at a way to reduce the cost so that the farmers get more money. Four kilograms of tea leaves from the farm is needed to make one kilogram of tea which is sold every week at the big tea auction that is in Mombasa and which has been very recognized. Other stations in the world are in Colombo and Calcutta in Sri Lanka and India. Momul factory manager Leonard Gitobu Muriinherit says the factory is using 60 million shillings per year to pay the cost of electricity to run its work equipment, and 50m more in buying firewood. Mr Muriinherit adds that according to this controversial situation, he had several tea factories in the destruction of the destruction company to register a multiconic Power Company in order to generate electricity in those industries. "According to things that are there now, every farmer is losing almost 5 shillings that would have gone through its payment in the payment of electricity every year," he said.

On June 12, this year the football competition to contest for the world cup was opened in the capital city of Brazil, Spro Paulo and is expected to continue until July 13. The whole world sucks up and discuss these matches with inspiration and absurers, with international companies doing billions of profit due to this incident. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The media has been denied to announce these matches. The most publicized story is news about Brazil's citizens who for a long time have been fighting police and soldiers who use all kinds of weapons, tear gas, bullets, marches, and so as to prevent protests associated with the World Cup. These anger started a year ago and have continued until the opening day when thousands of protesters gathered outside the stadium. While the viewers were organized to enter the field, the citizens of Brazil were condemning the way the 14 billion dollars was blocked in building 14 stadiums. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The government has organized 57,000 soldiers and 100,000 police who have been surrounded by soccer fields together with hotels of players and their training grounds. The results of the whole city of Sao Paulo has turned into a war field. One billion dollars will be used in defense and security even so, protests have continued across the country. The forces have used tear gas and bullets but failed to stop the angry people. Instead, they caused two protesters and three journalists injured on the opening. The anger broke out and the citizens were forced to use stones to protect themselves, while chanting "FIFA in our country" "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. These anger has been caused by several things, including sketches associated with these finals. For example, the Minas Arena have been given the right to own the Minerao stadium for a period of 25 years. They claim that they have invested 300 million dollars in knowing it. But what is known is that 180 million of those were given as a loan from the government of the government of Brazil (BNDES). "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. I mean they used public funds to invest in the project of citizens, and then they want them to get back their money "by leasing the stadium for 25 years this is just one example. There are other stadiums that have been built on this way of loans from the BNDES. President Ashma Rousseff of Brazil has been claiming the full cost of building plots is 4 billion dollars, but the real cost is approximately 14 billion dollars which is a large portion of loans from the public bank. Citizens are worried that the money will not be paid, something that has renewed their outrage to the referendum conducted recently, it has shown that 71 percent of Brazil's citizens are conservative. This is a huge increase from 55 percent last year. It is because they feel that billions of money used in the world cup is please be used in public services like education and treatment. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The World Cup is usually expected to connect the citizens of Brazil and provide a picture of development to the world and at the same time to promote tourism. Contrary, the image from a nation that is divided into the economy and the economy that does not meet the needs of the community. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

The problem of electricity is distribution of Valentine OBARA is not a government to launch a project that will increase 140 megawatts of electricity energy in the country is being added, although this is not enough to guarantee citizens better services for electricity distribution. The electricity distribution service in the country that is supervised by the Kenya Power company is one of the ones that are struggling greatly from the citizens and investors. Most of the time we have witnessed a lot of things from investors about the high cost of power energy, a situation that led them to raise the cost of the products or not to get losses in their businesses. Also, citizens who use electricity in their homes have been witnessing the disappearance of the power of electricity regularly. This situation makes many love to stay with questions about whether we are in the race to stay in competition with the nations that continue, because Kenya does not deserve this in the 21st century. That sector is among the most important areas in the efforts of raising the development of development in the country and lift the lives of life to the citizens. Therefore, it needs a lot of steps even though that is not enough to ensure they are taken to improve the provision of that service. The addition of the amount of power energy that is manufactured alone is not enough, as there are still those old techniques that will be used to distribute electricity. It is a must for Kenya Power to invest in modern technology equipment if we want to see changes in service delivery. It is a shame to be in this era, the residents of various streets in Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya that is respected by the international, they are forced to live in the dark without power energy for more than 24 hours because heavy rains have downtown. Shame! If the situation is the same in the capital city, you can't worry how it is in the farms especially in areas where rain is part of daily life. It will be wise if there will be no electricity equipment that can be endangered by the air, especially rain. It should be remembered that the government has been underway for several years now to increase the number of people who have access to electricity in the farms, although there is a style of Stima disappearance. There will be no benefit if the government will provide more weight production and forget to improve the methods of distribution of that service. The two issues are devastated and you deserve to be addressed together. There has been analysts of economic issues that are proposing to be empowered on another electricity distribution company which will bring competition to Kenya Power. In any business, competition leads to the concerned company to try more in service provision to customers. A good example is evident in the phone communication sector where the presence of many companies in the provision of those services has contributed greatly to enable the customers to make up the companies that feel they benefit them more. It should be required for them to discuss the issue of better distribution of electricity, not the efforts to increase the amount of electricity that produce it will not be beneficial to the citizens.

When he is in the stomach they have carried pregnant mmmmm then a man can give a cow to the parent of a woman in a parent who will be born after that birth, a woman is already married. That father who has already got to take a girl will give a cow to the small village after being insufficient. Fifteen or ten, the girl is married and the bad after he gets a child who cannot be brought down and it's because he is already a wife of a person to make it feel that poverty is the main cause of not doing what she did as a female child to think of things because they are made to be a business capital For me, I think the biggest thing here is maybe so that we should put it okay and we can be able to take a point of poverty only because of the critics when it comes to the family but when you are in a family does not discriminate a male child A female child but I think this is more than maybe to help their colleagues Saba to help Grace and the majority here is a system for the meaning of that Our families You find you for the Tanzanian boy If someone is understood in the family has attained thirty years old but it is still dependent on the family due to the systems that we become. It won't be a good environment for youth to prepare to be independent in the economy. He starts to discover themselves because of the age of ten and eight Who is recognized by our constitution because of a young man does not include a young man at the family level to prepare themselves as well as that is the biggest problem but second. There are problems in such a system. Traditional problems of these traditional problems that there are other people using traditional laws like those you said to sell the unborn child But we don't lie about poverty as poverty is the criterion to make a girl to reach goals because they can. I realize that poverty in his ability if he is doing an effort, he can tell me at the other time we do not know this week because we continue to complain about poverty, who is the responsibility of removing poverty even if you know that a big percentage are. The youth should also contact us. You see until empowerment The time they are oppressed, they decide. You may like us male children Actually you know He was able to be there that he didn't have a female child, I can't get to Swahili Time: Maybe what is doing for many female youth write about development To achieve their goals is to look at the differences with the male youth in our many African families who are working for a lot of work in home for example, they are all students going to school but coming out after a female child will find out, but when a young girl remains at home at the end of the day to do the Final. The things he said is very few but compared to the time he used the youth to read with the girl girl, read: A young man has spent a lot of time he will reach his goals but the girl's daughter becomes a barrier to him even to achieve his goals. But I think that if I think they have said that there is a lot of work, tweeting. In his work He becomes a young man to read is a boy who can be allowed from home to be able to get to his fellow youth to study but also number one at ten o'clock and two at eleven o'clock in the morning, the boy has made a good environment to achieve its goals than bin. And where you look at the side even where is education I am dedicated to a traditional example, we can reach here is just a small mind of the ability that is the ability to provide and That is caused by my parent, a boy is not a boy, because I know they will be news to go to the kitchen or do a lot of academic things that will help him help Do a good celebration is supposed to be except for the mother of home there is no need to read, I believe this is how young people know about our topic which was saying What is donate to a female boy If it reached its goals and is it here

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_18420225 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. For this hard work, Lukuvi the only one cannot be helped to help the land sector in the country for years is going through great changes, where its value we are, it is rising every day. There is a possibility that a few people who know well about the real value of the land that is a large part has not been tested since independence. If you want to know the real value of land, try to make investment, be private in that sector, then you'll see and undoubtedly you will be surprised. In urban and rural, nowadays the land is a resources that is being vied for too much, it has been a source of reasons for many conflicts and sometimes even disasters, people have met, others have got permanent disability. Unlike maybe during the previous phase, the land has been given a new view, we see his minister, William Lukuvi and his assistant, Angelina Mabula who went round in every corner of the country have turned out to be in conflicts. Laiti I could give an award or medal to the minister who did a good job in the year 2016, no doubt Lukuvi would be sold first. I would have changed, of course with his assistants, although not all, by trying to say the fact that all of them have been told that you are sent, to the extent that every place where Lukuvi has met with one type of conflict or land problems. I believe, Lukuvi admits, is one of the close aides of President John Magufuli who is no doubt happy. It is an enemy of land owners, including the leaders, where the club has changed, they use, some of them have been done to land, others are required to develop, otherwise it will go with water! The leaders, including the local government, villages in the country will have not like Lukuvi because of stealing the cry, sitting on their income sources. They don't know. Those who constructed in many areas in the city, including Dar es Salaam, if you remove them in a few areas that were tested and passed, they have passed away. I understand how they participated in one way or another in the allocation of land, plots or farms whose owners face conflicts. Some I believe that they are not like Lukuvi is the agents of plots and farms. Some of them started the pockets of their pockets, although their days have come at the end. Some of them ignored customers who wanted land for their use of different types. Also, experts, among the urban planning, land officers before the arrival of Lukuvi were bosses, seeing it was in sweat and these days have become small. Some of them lived in the verness, they found themselves in the land or intellectual ownership of plots, plantations, documents that took many years to receive, although these days I was told we should give it. As I explained earlier, the land sector is cross-cutting and ministries, many laws, has been conflicts, conflicts since the country got its independence 55 years ago. Why the conflicts of land does not end? A few who benefited, including the leaders, clever, among the scholars that killed the real value of land, brought it up or for buying, get free, and later they sell them through local officials, villages and agents, some of them are richest. That wealth that was found through the land, which we have been given to be a public property, you have left behind many conflicts that I have been told the Lake Region is leading in the country. Buyers of plots or farms for many years have been hurt, although they are now seeing light. As a result, the sector appeared to have a nuisance, the aka of evil and pain of many citizens, who wanted to invest in one way or another. The land, a curse, we have been told in the stories of religion that Kaini had killed and bury his brother, Abel on the ground and the curse has raised a majority of the world. We are told those who were asked to bring him the best harvest from the land so that they can be swept away, they are blamed. Many years later, the land that is very sensitive resources have continued to attract many to today. Look, a person who has invested in that sector in mind has the opportunity to live well, although in the urban side, the value of land has made it a way of causing disaster between farmers and breeders. I ask, now our generation are praying for the land, we are looking for one another, what will we leave the kids, our grandchildren of the future? The answer to this question is to set aside today, I guess it is our duty to all of us as a community to start looking at the land for a new view than it is now. We asked Lukuvi that he is walking the country and the whole country to solve a lot of land problems in urban and rural areas, we think he has nothing to do. I would have advised Lukuvi, whose friend since the age we met at the National Youth League (UV-CCM), along the Morogoro road, not afraid but icker. In that, Lukuvi has to understand that he has remained a leader with a stand, he will not stand up on that sector in that new perspective, thinking about how to change some of the laws governing that sector. I advise that the issue of getting documents to every owner of the land, plot or farm in the city and the villages should be given a new view, should be heard, if possible to use information available on these days easily to the public Identification Authority (Nida), the National Electoral Commission (NEC) or Rita to enable all land owners to get documents. The system of reviewing the ownership of different levels should be looked afresh so as to enable land to be resources that help in Tanzania to develop, borrow the bank or financial institutions that are trusted, not to be sold as it is now. My advice is to be monitored by the laws of that sector, to remove bureaucracy and great power to some people, including leaders and executives of the sector, that needs a national discussion. I do not want to believe that the issue to prepare and provide documents of plots or land to happen in the House or in the regional offices, it is important that the council should not be the authority of the agents of managing access to documents so as to help them get documents easily and generous in the collection of government. Along with that, the use of commercial land, construction of big buildings in the country, it is also a must that its laws should be handled in order for land taxes and buildings to the council to make sense, benefits to the country.

Doctor Kebwe said that when he spoke to the leaders of Morogoro Football Association (MRFA), the leadership of the Jamhuri Stadium and the players of Morogoro Police soccer team together with their leaders after the completion of the First Division League match against Njombe town the day before yesterday at the stadium. That provincial commissioner said he is supporting the decision by Minister Nape to stop those teams with many fans to use that stadium. "The National Stadium has been built by our friends of China by using a high cost that is tax for citizens... Yanga and Simba have gone through the loss of the government and because they don't have a chance to use that stadium, we welcome them to use it at the Jamhuri Stadium because there is no seats to shine," said Doctor Kebwe. Therefore, he instructed the leadership of the Jamhuri Stadium to start producing huge renovation of infrastructure and the area of playing with other games so as to meet modern standards for the purpose of playing national and international games. "I call three months to the leaders of this stadium to start renovating them to be modern starting from athletics, football, hands and netball and while in those standards, we welcome them to invite Yanga and Simba to come and play at the Jamhuri Stadium," said Doctor Kebwe. In addition, Doctor Kebwe has praised Morogoro Police team for starting well in the First Division League competition in his group, he urged them to put more effort and knowledge by following the instructions of their teachers so as to play well in the next games inside and outside that province. "I would like to see Morogoro Police team moves to the premier league... that is why the provincial government and various local and foreign stakeholders have abandoned their energy to support this team to do well and eventually to play the premier league next season," said Doctor Kebwe. He said in order to promote football and others, it is good for the leadership of that stadium to take a step of renovating different areas for the purpose of being used.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_15946993 Politics have forgotten the risk of El Nino Sep 30, 2015 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The way for Tanzania to easily think of El-Nino rains which are expected to begin to fall next month can explain why our ability to fight disaster is small. What is clear is that we have not been seen before the disaster has not been on the wall but we stand up when the enemy is on the door. I have been following up on the broadcast of television and radio stations in Kenya and discovered that our colleagues have already started taking different steps to fight or at least reduce the effects that are expected to occur because of the disasters that are expected to fall in the East African region from the second week to the third of October. First, already El Nino has already been a major agenda in Kenya which will be discussed in mainstream media and social media every day, with the government giving information on what is doing and why the citizens are expected to do. According to one source, the government of Kenya has given a budget of 15 billion shillings for fighting the disaster of El Nino, the government has given five billion shillings while donors including the World Bank and the European Union promised to give 10 billion shillings that are remaining. Some states have begun to hold meetings with citizens in their areas to educate on how to deal with El Nino, while the National Anti-Maafa Center (NDOC) has planned to provide professional instructions, education and coordination of the central government and the provinces before the rains, during the rains and after the rains. But, the most important thing is that the various authorities of the Kenyan government in the cities, especially Nairobi have started to stir up in order to allow water to pass easily. The government has also been able to encourage citizens to do that activity in their streets. On the advice of experts, measures have been taken to put stones, cobbles or building a hard floor to prevent the erosion of some areas. Local governments have organized to relocate people in the valley areas that are expected to be affected by those rains. Special areas to relocate the affected people are already underway.

When people went to know with the procedures if you had God Father, he died or we are the ones that says the local hope that you get the capital when you get very close to me and I know in a way that a common man will understand.

"But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. That game that took place at the Uhuru Stadium in Dar es Salaam, was previously held on Wednesday together with other matches including Simba and Prisons, but it was pushed back after JKT asked. The national building team requested the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) through the league board urging them to bring them ahead of one day after getting tired of the long journey from Bukoba, Kagera where I had a match at the end of last week. Together with the results of their game against Yanga who were scored 2-1, the big one is the end of the first round of that league that involves a total of 16 teams. That league was finalized we will have a representatives of Tanzania Mainland in the international competition of the champions league together with that of the African Confederation. The first round has ended with a lot of challenges, which are supposed to be amended or not we will continue to be an actor in national football for the club and even our national teams. All the days when you have a national premier league, undoubtedly you will get a weak national team because its players are benefiting from the clubs, which are participating in that bad league that is not competitive. On the side of the club, they are the same as the team will get a championship without using the mind, strength or their efforts, thus he will be found a champion who is not capable, who is participating in the international competition will be released early. The first round of the Tanzania Mainland Premier League have witnessed a huge tension on the side of the referees, some of them have been unable to comply with 17 soccer laws by being formed. It is possible for other referees to form a bad luck and some did so intentionally after being pushed by pressure from some side or others did not want to do so, but because of no knowledge of those laws, that is why they found themselves in trouble. To know the law is one issue and to implement it is another issue, therefore, that can also be the existence of our referees, who have failed to do well. On the side of TFF themselves, they are required to be very careful because we have seen the mistakes of referees have ever caused incidents of breach of peace as at the National Stadium, where Simba fans broke chairs. Referees being unable to follow the procedures or soccer laws not only can cause non-wise lovers and to destroy the infrastructure, they can also be the referees. It is the expectation of soccer stakeholders to be TFF in the second round of the Tanzania Mainland Premier League, it will take a big step to ensure the referees that are planned to make soccer in justice without any privilege.

The state of the debate on the government's budget for the financial year 2012 / 2013 in parliament is not satisfactory, some of the members of parliament showing the little ability to afford economic debates and instead, they have directed them to the competition of political arguments, the government has ruled among them the amount of throwing words that are non-civilization, Citizen Mwema, has noted. That situation is seen when the Minister of Finance, Doctor. William Mgimwa has already announced his budget with Shadow Finance Minister, from the opposition camp, Kabwe, while presenting his alternative budget that has been published in the local pages of this newspaper. The trend of displaced and politically motivated violence has come out among the members of parliament two days after the debate on the budget started by members of parliament, John Mnyika, Mwigulu Nchemba, Peter Msigwa and Captain John Komba, Chiku About, Kangi Ligora, Ezekiah Wenje, on a way in the trend of debates, it has proven itself in the political argument, but the minister of state, office of the president, parliament and coordination, William Lukuvi, calling on leaders of the parliamentary camps to be on the forefront to protect the honor of that national pillar, that represents the public. The member of parliament for Ubungo, John Mnyika (CHADEMA) who compared some of the members of parliament equivalent to the "pain" not to be responded to their concerns and said that the Revolutionary Party (CCM) is nonsense and the president is weak, found himself out of the parliament hall after Lukuvi, to read the regulations regarding the procedure of parliamentary debates to confirm that, Mnyika has broken the procedures. Previously, before Mnyika he said the president is weak and compared some of the members of parliament to be the same as the pain and CCM is nonsense, the situation that made the deputy speaker, Job Ndugai, wanting him to look for those words in explanation that it is an annoying language, which is against the regulations of running the parliament activities. After the time of window, Mnyika opened the statement of calling the others to be allowed to continue with the debate, but as he continues, the member of parliament of Iringa Town, Pastor Peter Msigwa was involved in saying words, contrary to the regulations of the parliament that directed other members of parliament not to speak when their colleague speaks with the speaker's permission. But when Mnyika giving that language, as well as claiming that the president is weak, contrary to the requirements of the parliamentary regulations and to reach a step of being released outside the parliament hall, the member of parliament of Iramba West, Mwigulu Nchemba, the day before yesterday evening, in a state of showing political violence, he called a budget that was organized by the opposition camp in parliament that it is "waste" and decided to put the copy of the speech that he was holding on the hand while contributing to the debate. However, in what proves the weakness of the leading session of that day, chairman Silvester Mabumba, was unable to control the government's attention. Apart from those members of parliament, the member of parliament for Singida East, Tundu Lissu, on Monday also compared the session of parliamentary meetings about the budget to be the same as the season of ignorance (silly season), but on his part, the member of parliament of Mbinga West, Captain John Komba (CCM), who requested for civilization will be taken to parliament and warned that, if the boxing camp will be used because the number of their boxing is small and the side of CCM have a lot of boxing. As members of parliament were intended to show misconduct within the axis, the noise that aren't prepared or consent of the deputy speaker who was leading the session were many, one side of the noise showing the situation of being bullied by others, trying to show that the cry of bullied is not correct. It is a discussion that is translated to denying citizens an opportunity to know more about the economic and cultural situation in general, from their representatives who now have decided to enter into political tensions. The Deputy speaker of Parliament, Job Ndugai tried to stop the weather by using the rapist, assisted by Minister Lukuvi. But some of the concerns raised by the opposition members is together with the statement of the member of parliament of Mwibara, Kangi Ligora, who was surprised with the members of parliament without respecting the Revolutionary Party that pay the salaries. Kangi Lugola is one of the few members of CCM who had signed a document of not having faith in the prime minister, under the coordination of Kigoma North member of parliament, Kabwe, found himself in a difficult time, after the Mbozi West member of parliament, David Silinde wanted a guide to the speaker so as to look for that statement, an argument that was emphasized by the member of parliament, James Mbatia. In his argument, Silinde urged the government to fix his instructions which outlined mistakes that are available in the speech of the opposition camp, and especially in the collection of revenue collection. But Silinde was opposed by the member of parliament, Christopher Ole Sendeka who read the book of the opposition budget speech to confirm those mistakes and at the same time, reading the book of the Minister of Finance, Doctor. William Mgimwa, to confirm what is described as a concentration in the writing of the budget. The current meeting of parliament will return to the previous meetings where the three members of CHADEMA had been released outside the sessions, with the mistake of not following the requirements of the regulations of the parliamentary sessions. The members of parliament of CHADEMA that have ever been released outside the parliament hall is together with the former member of parliament of Arusha Town, Godbless Lema, the member of parliament of Singida East, Tundu Lissu and the member of parliament of Iringa Town, Pastor Peter Msigwa.

The fight against the use of drug trafficking in the country is expected to take a new chapter, after the East African Development Community (SADC), planning to deal with that business by using collective energy of the country. Those details have been given Monday this week by the minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation of Tanzania, Bernard Membe, when he was speaking at the television show of general on Monday, run by legendary journalist, General Ulimwengu, every Monday at Channel Ten television station. Countries that form SADC from Tanzania include South Africa, Zimbabwe, Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia and Seyshelles. Madagascar has been called for the membership of the community. It is in some of those countries where some of the countries have been cut off with drugs and the latest incident is the arrest of popular artist Agnes Masogange and Mellis Edward, who were arrested in South Africa at the International Airport of Oliver tambo and drugs that are claimed to have a value of more than six billion shillings. Speaking about that issue, Minister Membe said the fight against drugs is big and he gave a call to people with goals of wanting to vie for the presidency in the year 2015 to do the fight against drugs to be among their agenda, by considering that the use of those drugs are the destruction of the youth. Membe who was the leader of SADC observers in Zimbabwe's general elections recently, spoke about the trend of the election saying that the draft constitution will be presented in the next session of the heads of that union that will take place in Malawi. In the election of Zimbabwe, the ruling ZANU-PF party of President Robert Mugabe (89) which formed a campaign to fight for land and land in the direction of opposing foreigners, especially the whites that own a large portion of land in the country, managed to get a white member of parliament, Joshua Sacco. Sacco has won the parliamentary seat of Chimanfaith in East and amazing nations to follow the country's politics. Mugabe has been joked that Joshua is a white man at the end of Zanu- PF. In the year 2009, Joshua was elected as the deputy secretary of production at ZANU PF on the side of the youth and was the first white person to hold that position in Zimbabwe. That was surprising is to see the white man in the elimination stage to get the ZANU-PF consent to vie for the parliamentary seat, he voted for the former member of parliament of that party and the deputy minister of economy, planning and investment in Zimbabwe, Samuel Undenge.

Their work is to speak out and those involved know, but do not inform us, the results are getting publicly kweeting. There are many. Before the start of the premier league season, journalists in an article and normal news quoted various experts, they wrote a lot to remind of that before the league started, it needs players of all teams to test their health. It was a very important thing. I Don't know whether the work happened or is done to More than 400 players of the Premier League teams, I Don't think. It needs a club to test the health of his players every time so as to overcome the problem of falling on the field and sometimes losing life. They both wrote. It was also written that the players are required to have been paid for health insurance. If a player will be given a health insurance, it will help him and his family by paying a little amount of money. It will enable even a player to go to test for his time. I'm not sure if all 400 players have health insurance. Last week, it was sad and tears losing the upcoming, Ismail Mrisho Khalfan who was serving Mbao FC of U-20 in Bukoba town. I can say it is a result of the leaders of the team not listening to him and he is working to test their players for different reasons. That of Bukoba is the result, but look at the league is over, every leader of his mind is to play with his work in the second round, what he will do to win the championship. After the end of the first round of the premier league, the truth I have not heard a certain team has made tests to its players, even the pictures of the spread of them, no. The first round has ended and now it is near the second and the teams have started preparation, was being tested for health; the pressure is the same? What is the consummation of the body? Who is supposed to get the service? They played a row and got fatigue, they should go back to the body by doing what? I Don't know whether it happened. This is one of the players to test the health, there is this of the managers of the game to allow the game to continue without having the first free service. There is one match that was played at the Karume Stadium, Dar es Salaam. I don't remember it was who and who I remember is that, in that game, the player was hurt, he had his fellow players to accompany their colleague to go out for the game to continue. There are many sports events but they miss the first service. How is it possible for the referee to start a battle while there is no even a car for the first service? This is the work of practice. The referee or the supervisor of the game is supposed to inspect if every area has been completed by helping with his assistants. Most of the matches will be played but there is no first service that is done nor service providers who are qualified in sports services, and maybe the ones that are, or they do not have expertise or they do not have experience and what is happening is a practice for them to be in the field. Not being keen, especially the desk of the first service, the results of the players lost their lives. For example, a player has been faced with a problem, the concerned person is what you know is to throw the muscles, welcome him to the snow, but if there will be some they don't lie. It needs real experts. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

The ministry's statements, BMT to be consistent W last week, the Ministry of Information, Arts, Culture and Sports together with his body, the National Sports Council (BMT), made statements about the stand of those agencies in sports this year. Those statements were made in a special interview with this newspaper when he wanted to hear the voice of the government after starting the new year of 2017. The deputy minister of information, arts, culture and sports, Anastazia Wambura said the government is giving a warning to the leaders of sports parties that this is a year of implementation of sports in actions and the time of bringing the propaganda is over. Wambura insisted that this year will be a problem for leaders who are used to lead sports in tension and that the government will need the implementation, efficiency and the aim is to make a year to be successful. He said 2017, to be the year of preparation for the Commonwealth Games of 2018, the African Games of 2019, and the Olympic Games that was planned to take place in the year 2020. Wambura said the government wants to see every leader of the game of the game is implementing its responsibilities, including a year of success. BMT, through his secretary general, Mohamed Kiganja has promised that 2017 will not be a year to shame the leader of any sports party that will fail to implement its responsibilities fully. Kiganja has said that it has passed the year of implementation of those actions, bad leaders should inform them and that it will start in the district to the nation. He said starting from now the preparations song will not come to heads of sports parties and he has planned to meet with them tomorrow so as to start giving strategies. When we add that plan, especially since the government has already seen the weakness of the year 2016 which Tanzania continued to be the head of this madness. Such statements are creating, but on the basis that they should not end up being a statements to the media, it turned into a strong implementation and actions. This issue of the minister crossing parties to make and implement the activities and BMT to control the leaders who sell sports parties to the village, it will reverse the honor of this sector. A citizen can ask ourselves now, Tanzania is estimated to have 50 million people at the moment, where we get 100 athletes who are iva in different games to represent the Olympic Games? The fact is that most of the sports parties are not in the sake of sports, they are not in order to manage sports programs to their parties, more than turning the village to look and look for international federations that are being sent to the development of the concerned games, but there is no matter of what is being hit. For starting, we think the ministry and BMT to make a census of parties that are in the country, the existing games and remaining the ones that do not agree, to be improved, get better to follow and remain a few things that will have the ability to meet the expectations of the citizens especially the lovers of the concerned game. We believe, together with those statements, the collective power between the ministry, BMT, Directorate of Sports Development, the registrar of parties and sports clubs together with the Olympic Committee of Tanzania (TOC).

Members who are not faithful are dangerous to the welfare of the party, CCM followers participating in the launch of the general elections campaign at the wilderness grounds in Dar es Salaam city last year. One of the ways that bring success in any matter so that the existence of credibility to those involved are dealing with that issue is to make it sincerely. Human beings who becomes a contribution to the community of bringing development is a must to have five major things. Those things are skills, truth, justice, legal and integrity. One with the five things he can be counted that he is a person who is complete and he can give a contribution to development in his community. A man holding those things the issue of bringing development to his private will be a dream of helping the community that goes around. In the political parties, the integrity of members is the most important thing because it is why it can be able to goalkeeper the development of the concerned party even if it can hold power to lead the government. The party members are not integrity, they can bring some misconceptions that you think that you have followers that can get a goalkeeper from your party victory, but when you get elections, you are not there. Therefore, lack of integrity in the party is dangerous because the party can think it has many followers and the real situation is not the same. It is a primary thing for members to be integrity in their party and to make sure that they don't go to any way even in secret ways. The integrity of the party, the chairperson of the Association of Parents of the Revolutionary Party (CCM), Abdallah Bulembo said recently that there are members who are charishabitical in that party. Bulembo who is a member of the executive committee of CCM speaking to the students of the universities who are followers of that party in Zanzibar town, he said that there are members of the night they become CUF. That leader who led the campaigns to achieve the victory of President John Magufuli in the Tanzania general elections that took place on October 25th, 2015, said that issue is bad. Bulembo urged CCM members to be fair and not to be able to sabotage the party and deny it in his responsibilities. It is possible that Bulembo can be there because if that leader would not be able to say something that he has not heard. In fact, the issue of Duncan kuwili is not a new thing in politics, but it is bad and that hung in all community activities. Together with that Bulembo spoke to his CCM party, but that issue of lack of credibility to the party is not responsible for any party. So it is good for the people who have decided to come out to support a certain party to do so for their hearts and they should not be intimidated. That behavior should be avoided so as to bring the welfare of political parties and to ensure there is peace and stability in the country. Acts of violating the party's instructions or to be used by another party and to sabotage your party is an inappropriate thing and it must be reduced because it can endanger peace. It is good if anyone sees that he cannot be honest in his party, what he decided to join from exit and he remains without having any political party since there is no mistake. However, that afternoon is like a sheep, but the night is wearing a leopy skin is a dangerous thing and can even lose your life. Politics are on the sidelines of the high level and there are other people who can't allow if you will make actions against their party and they discovered that issue. In that kind of environment that could happen and the concerned person is found to be affected, something that can be avoided. To reach CUF in recent days, there has been words of some people who want the Civic United Front (CUF) to be postponed for claims that it is changing and endangering the peace of the country. Those claiming some of them while politicians claim that CUF has been encouraging citizens to oppose the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar (SMZ) and not cooperating with it. Before the Zanzibar general elections that was sacked CUF was partnering with CCM to form the national government of the national union (SUK) that led Zanzibar for five years since 2010. However, the national government of the nation was broken after the repeat election of Zanzibar that has been boycotted by CUF and its results to put him in power the government of CCM. Apart from taking that break, the repeat election broke the right direction that was reached by CCM and CUF which brought the peace situation in the country and to cancel the tensions that existed among those parties. The right time for Zanzibar between CCM and CUF was reached after the agreement between the former president of Zanzibar and the deputy chairperson of CCM Zanzibar, Doctor Amani Abeid Karume and the secretary general of CUF, Maalim Seif Shariff Hamad. The breath of SUK and the right has sparked the political division in Zanzibar and the state of tensions to the citizens is back in afresh where some of the people of Zanzibar get involved in providing community services like selling products. In the current situation, the thoughts of wanting to cancel CUF is not a solution to the problems that are in Zanzibar. In any way even when the political parties will decide to reach CUF it does not mean that the situation will make Zanzibar be safe. There is no doubt that CUF followers if their party will be wanted to join the ruling CCM party. However, of course, those followers can support another party or they created a new party and the situation continues as usual and they increase the opposition to the ruling party. In that view, it is good for all those with ideas of wanting CUF to be searched for them to look for those ideas because they do not have any contribution in removing the political division that is in Zanzibar. If there is a true commitment is good for the politicians of Zanzibar to meditate and find alternative ways to end the political crisis in Zanzibar. The true democracy that can bring peace and stability in the country is to ensure that everything is done by considering the basis of justice. It is a must that every event in the country should be done in the legitimacy without having injustice to some people or to provide biased in some people. In other words the country is supposed to have a true democracy where every citizen will get their right without any conditions.

In Dar es Salaam, Dar es Salaam, there are many challenges that cancer patients are meeting them especially for women who have breast cancer. Those challenges have caused those patients to cut up and continue with treatment and decided to cut the dose and return to their homes. That situation happens after getting tired to struggle to find money to afford the cost of drugs while talking to stigmatization while being away by coming to the Ocean Road Hospital (ORCI) which covers treatment and investigation of the disease. A big challenge that many victims are asking to be assisted is together with the availability of medicine in the type of Chemotherapy which is given as treatment in that hospital. Speaking recently during the launch of the Hope of the Woman, one of those patients, Biwitnesses Shaiza, says they are usually told that those drugs are free but when they ask them often they are told that they are forced to buy in foreign shops where they are sold expensive. "I have paid that dose in the first round with a lot of problems with a cost of 200,000 shillings after being told that the drugs are not found in the hospital, here I didn't know the second and third dose I will get it," says Shaiza. He explains that he went to Tanga province to follow the service in Dar es Salaam city after his brother helped him to afford the cost of distance since it was difficult to serve him while there. Another patient Mwajuma Mohamed, says the community has not been educated enough about that disease and many women are not going to the hospital for believing that they can undergo surgery and died. He claims that the current community in some areas and especially rural areas do not believe that the breast cancer patient can undergo surgery and saw it. He explains that even when he discovered that he had that disease in the year 2013, he got tired of telling her brothers that he believes that they will not accept the surgery to remove the breasts. "I was afraid to tell them because there are others who are known to have surgery to be bad and there are those who believe that even radiation has effects. "But after a long time I saw the swelling that was going to grow, I made a decision to go to the hospital and they advised them to cut off, I saw the same because there are those who have refused to appeal and their condition is bad, therefore I involved brothers and agreed to help me," he says. Mwajuma says there are still faith in witchcraft about that disease and there are people who believe that infected with AIDS, therefore they will build cancer victims as they feel they can be infected. And the Director of Tanzanian Cancer support and Hope Faundation (TCS-Hope), Halima Kasungu, says many patients have returned to their villages after failing to afford the cost of buying those drugs for all the doses and other problems that they get there. "The Chemo drug is very expensive for low-income earners fail to afford.

Last week, my Korean friends were encouraged to visit them as part of the Shanghai city called North Korea in Guprices in Shanghai. This area has been killed in North Korea because a large percentage of Christians in Shanghai live in this place, and there are many Korean businesses. In revolving in the streets of Tatown, it was announced by the majority of the Chinese who came out for a variety of luxury, including food, drinks, and various tourist attraction sites. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Jump to what I saw is that North Korea's culture sell China. The long queues in food restaurants, big shops and the apparent lack of Chinese people wanting to take a photo next to the statue of popular Caribbean artists is enough evidence. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. When I returned home, I got the desire to know more about this South Korean culture influence. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. A small study showed that, not only China, the whole Asian continent in recent years has been created by a wave of art and culture from Korea: I'm talking to acting television (popular as K-dramas), film, music (famous as K-pop) food, clothing and fashion. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. This is Asia from China to Hong Kong and Taiwan. Japan, India to Turkey Meanwhile, South Asian countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Cambodia, Thailand - turn on television or radio and is sure that you will meet television literature. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. It is also an act of drama that is also on the spotlight of other Korean culture sections that now it has been made to be a fashion to eat Kikorea which famous actors seem to be in literature, wear like them, to follow her hair and cosmetics. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. I have been told in Thailand, in their Bangkong city, cosy shops have been filled with beauty and beauty services, where in the slogan, they were promised to be officiated by the traditional sandals. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The impact was also taken into computer Games. It is a success not that cultural and art is now testing the desire of tourists to visit the country. I have heard that Kikorea has also been made a fashion for now. While Mandarin (Chinese) is spreading and spread of economic and business reasons, Kikorea is known for cultural and art. It's like in my home, young people are learning to go hand in hand with the progress of Europe. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The wave of spread and growing influence of art and cultural practices did not start soon. In 2001, Chinese media participated in the wave of "Hallyu" (or Hallyu-wood). "But I'm not Going to do it.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_45087706 The list of coalition issues will be included II Mar 13, 2014 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. On the qualifications of being elected as a presidential candidate or parliament (article 79 and. 125), for now, the parties that are interested - are not true to select a candidate. Yet some who were chosen to contest would not be selected as voters would know. Propogens of parties and fans are the ruling. As a result, the nation is getting bad leaders and a weak government. I suggest that there should be a tool to filter and make up the qualifications of candidates presented by the parties. It should be a authority to refuse and ordering parties to do other or another. The Electoral Commission has given that authority. In implementing this responsibility, the commission will be led by the taboo of leadership listed in this constitution. There are other countries with the same approach to filter. Without having such a tool, those qualifications will remain in papers and things will continue as usual we were used to and the nation will continue to get bad leaders. Parliament suing President "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. It is my opinion that the proposed amount of 75 percent of the parliamentary votes for the purpose of creating an investigation committee and to remove the president is very high. Why more than 50 percent was suspended for the form of the committee and 66 percent (two-thirds) stopped him for more than that level is "competing." Also, the constitution should talk to the president or the leader who had been removed from power that you deserve to be paid the pension benefits - as it is for other public servants who are fired. The process of changing the constitution "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. For this we are led by the experience we have already received and the weight of the constitution passed by the citizens. The ability to change the constitution should not be easy like this proposed, which is being used now. This process has enabled the ruling party to use the numbers of its members of parliament to cancel the rights of private citizens to vie for the presidency or parliamentary without being appointed by the political party. Let me allow this process of changing the constitution continue. I recommend first, two-thirds of the members of parliament from Tanganyika and two-thirds from Zanzibar will be needed as it is now and secondly; two-thirds of the opposition members - these are representing the citizens who choose, third; if the intended changes are big article 119 recommended and supported. The creation of the Parliament of the Republic article 113 needs a comprehensive analysis, not to implement it. I see the elections in his region will be very high even to do the work of candidates to make a campaign to be hard and expensive. There are also questions of asking: The party's election manifesto or the candidate will have such policies on defense and security issues, foreign affairs and other things like that to convince the voters to vote on the possibility of the country's leaders to choose the members of parliament of the United Republic as it is taking place at the parliament of the East African Community. But the president is elected by the citizens. I suggest it. The role of the election director's role in the role of the election director (article 196; -3) - that "the election director of the Electoral Commission will implement its obligations by assisted by executives who are public servants...." Director does not be made to use public servants as it is now. There is evidence that shows that the workers are serving the bloggers - the commission on one side and his employer on the second side who wants his demands are met and misleading. I suggest that it would be able to employ or select its staff who will be responsible for him. The revenue sources of the coalition government in the revenue sources of the coalition government (article 231) first; this proposal, in my opinion, will give birth to a weak government and put the United Republic as a shadow. It is the government which has no authority to charge taxes to its citizens so that it can serve as required, we want the government of a powerful coalition. This strength is together with the ability to get enough revenue to run the coalition government. Those income contributes to every citizen with the ability to pay taxes and every institution paid taxes in accordance with the law. On the current procedure, citizens pay taxes that runs the union activities and activities of Tanzania Mainland and Zanzibar. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_78507331 The government will ban plastic packaging, Jan 12, 2017 by Gideon Shoo. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Drugs is a topic that has been prevalent in the media for a long time. The debate about the problem of drug abuse has been emerging and long for decades now. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. They have taken different research about the effects of drug abuse. Research is aiming at looking at the loopholes used to bring in the country, the intensity of drug trafficking, the use of torture and manufacturer in the country. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. However, despite a lot of research and recommendations of different researchers on the steps of taking so as to overcome the problem of the use of torture in the country, we are still seeing how the problem progresses. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. It is the fact that the torture causes the biggest problem of a very dangerous disease known as shame. Shame is a very dangerous disease which makes a patient be dependent on those drugs and he will remove them in a sensible group. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Someone who is ashamed of thinking like another normal person and lives in his own world that he is removing them in a strong group of work in the community. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. But while we are looking for ways to deal with the importation of torture in the country, it is important we look at here in the country because there is a group of people who are affected by a shame that is derived from what we want to call the torture. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. It is very true that the torture of the family of bbles and heroos is a big business that is being hit all over the world. In addition, the torture is a very big business that puts billions in billions of money. Those who sponsor those businesses are the greatest rich people with the ability to buy anything including their freedom. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. But when we are very close to screaming about the torture from outside the country, there is a problem that doesn't get the eyes as required and discussed with it is that I said above the shame that comes from alcohol. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. I have ever wrote last year that in my village that I live in Wari Sinde, Machame North, there is a disease that is called a section. This is the disease that comes from the shame of alcohol. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The shame of alcohol has been a big problem in our community. This is not a secret issue because leaders knew that and instead of looking at and find the medicine they do as if there is no problem. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The statistics of the researchers say that there are more than 300,000 shillings. However, those statistics do not think that they have involved with alcohol, the problem that has now spread across the country. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. But alcohol consumption has increased from 35 to 45 percent taking place without following the rules, regulations and procedures. Each one with salt or a shop of salt and oil selling hot alcohol. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. As a result of the sale of random alcohol, all the oro are being sold to be bars because of the ease of drinking alcohol every time and therefore, to do with its excessive drinking and the procedure that is understood. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The Government is supposed to take quick action to deal with this problem by checking the issue of packaging. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Currently, there are various alcohol sold at the packaging of plastic equipment for the capacity of 100 to 500. The packaging, this is easy to view them and therefore you can find one person when when the packaging that will enable them to carry up to 1000 shillings which is one liter of alcohol. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Both are not tweeting like Beer. These alcohol have its own approach to use. Our people who use the alcohol are not following the procedure and they are sure they are drinking alcohol as they stole, a bedroom, football and others. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The act of drinking alcohol such as alcohol is very dangerous and can cause it not only shame but even deaths. But this is something that at some point the government can contribute to its speed. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The government is responsible for review the permission that gave the packaging of plasma as one of the steps to reduce the ease of recovery and alcohol. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Furthermore, that availability easily has made even non-allowed groups to get them easily. Right now there is alcohol with a taste of milk, the flavor of nanasi and other fruits and that makes them even the school children to get them and use it. This is a great danger. The nation is dying as we see. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Removing plastic packaging will help significantly reduce the availability of severe alcohol. Moreover, that step will help a lot in reducing pollution of the environment that is currently rampant from the city to the villages. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

Let's give me one reason why the parliamentary debates should be killed and I will give them ten reasons why it should be done completely. Again, I will tell you as a very ordinary citizen. God should prevent us from the speculation of their discussion. Again these days with the decision is not, therefore, I have a need to listen to them as they get themselves like they are in the village instead of fantasy. Let's go out of the national security and national security. Linda fools in a country respect equal rights, we have to protect themselves in society. Well. If the only reputation of being a member of parliament is to be able to know how to read and write only, while even if the driver must have a form four certificate, why are the seats, let's give me one reason why should not be the solution to the culprits? He has not apologized to be the minister. She is asked to be given a job that needs a mind. He has been asked to be a member of parliament for his hand to go to a chameleon and chips. When a person was not a member of parliament, he should say in parliament because it is the terms of terms of the Honorable. Now if the statement takes place in front of us in the whole country, we are doing justice. Not his fault, he is not impressed, why should he be appointed? As we show a Professor in class? The whole professor provides an incredible words but he is predicted by his college, those who know his stupidity is those students. If a Professor is protected by why the Honorable who knows to read and write only does not fail? That is why Tanzania is a country of people who are in the Almighty God is clear that we are supposed to protect the status of these honorable members who ota to look for work that goes with their qualifications. Linda's language on that we would like our national language and we don't like you to do it, we must realize that they are others who don't know our national language well. Even foreign is a problem. For example, when a person uses the word "beige" knows his meaning? It's not his fault if he was opposition when the teachers got in class. Or because he has been used to stay in the village and the village language is completely bad for other citizens to spread Swahili. So, in order to protect our citizens against the bad use of the language which they receive or get to them, these use must be secret. When there are no doubt those who are coming out to be interrogated and spread the wrong words that were said in the privacy of antantic. Linda faith, the peace of the previous voters was coming out to elect this or the one. I don't think that most of them look at their candidate at the political level. They look at the colors of his clothes without caring about the content inside the color without forgetting those who watched the brown or t-shirt or a selfie. If we don't believe, how many went to the campaign meetings of prospective members of their constituency? Now they want to realize that the favorite person is doing things like this, this can make me laugh. They will fail to work. They will fail to keep his family. They will fail to build a country. Yes. When I was younger, we trust our leaders. We respect them not because they were honorable, again this word was born completely. We respect them from the words and acts of respect. That is why we are volunteering to die and recovery to build a nation. We went to power even with the students. We went to teach our father and sisters and sisters and brothers to read and write... without demanding five cents, because we believe our leaders. We really believe we were on one trip. Not all of us have a suit. Now just imagine, see the other words of the knowledge offered by the Honorable, people will have Mori true to build the nation. Linda's interest is a foundation of a mid-fielder, those who will be added and I realise that, unfortunately, this country has left God who like to follow the mid-fielder. Those who are with, the winners, have the right to protect and without suffering from the eye of the second side. This is the first commandment. Linda needs your interest to protect the interests of others. That's why someone in the spring, he looks just one thing. Being a woman and women in the second side are being assaulted by a man on their side, he will go ahead of humanity and honor of women. We must keep the interest of his group ahead. He must protect his colleagues with interest together. Most notably, as a person in a certain area, potentially as a colleague, who are the first, others are the dream of allies. However, it is not good to be seen because you can be misunderstood by the citizens who do not know these regulations or those who do not know these regulations or those who do not know what they have got. That is why we can see the scenes for people to protect their interests. Linda the male system does not have a mistake. The country has its culture. His culture is a male system that does not get yourself. Bloggers are losing time. I myself, I am looking for you to tell you every corner and you love you, I must give you a gift. There is wrong things. I do this because we are men. Being ahead. Now if someone is doing so in his life he has a mistake to see all women are there? Isn't his ideas? But in front of citizens with limited access and limited access to themselves who are the most voters, you can be misunderstood. That is why we use privacy to protect our culture. Don't tell me that it is not true. This is not a point. The point is that we should protect our culture of seeing them as if we do not do so, at the end of the day people will know that they have a mind than us. Mmmh!! Linda the open source and Creative Commons have been made. We do not want a general broadcast because there are above, but these retailers are wrong?

"But I'm not Going to do it. Published: 13 December 2016 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The Coastal Province is expected to have a modern stadium which will help to promote youth soccer and lift sports in that province which has been claimed to be one of the provinces that will bring talents. The stadium is expected to be built in the Msexual village and the government of the people of China, the aim being to promote that game in that province. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Speaking at a special event that was organized for the purpose of going to visit the area which will be constructed at the stadium, the retired president of the fourth phase, Doctor Jakaya Kikwete who was the guest of honor at the event, said the stadium will be built through the sponsorship of the government of China. "This Stadium will be a savior in the development of soccer in the Coastal region and the country as a whole. It will help in raising the talents of upcoming players and be used in the club and the national team for the future days, "said Doctor Kikwete. He said the aim of the construction of that stadium is to see that the Coastal Region and Tanzania in general produces many talented players who will be used in the national team, different clubs and others being sold out of the country. "I have talked to our friends of the government of China and they have agreed to build up the stadium and that is the foundation thing in the development of the soccer game in our nation," said Doctor Kikwete. Doctor Kikwete said that he commends the government of china for seeing the importance of helping to build the plot, adding that when the moment will be completed, it will have other games that will be done far from the soccer game, the aim being to give them the opportunity for the youths to be able to show their talents. And the representative of China ambassador in the country, Yang Tong promised to continue to cooperate with the government of Tanzania especially in the sports sector.

In many areas of the country there have been a long cry for some of the citizens missing land for agriculture, rearing and construction of residential houses while in the areas surrounding them, there are few citizens who have divided the big areas where many of them have turned into a lot of destruction as a result of not being continued. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. That cry has now been heard because the fifth term government has started to take action if they have made those people from not developing, instead, to give them a commitment to develop including being given farmers for the purpose of agricultural activities. If that is not enough, the day before yesterday, the Minister of Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development, William Lukuvi noted the government's strategy to capture more people who come to the areas without developing where from July next year, to put up strict ownership laws and owners of those land will be charged high taxes. We are increasing the government's decision because the situation has been bad, the rich are owning a big land without developing the while they are surrounded by citizens in those areas they do not have areas to grow and build houses. They are using that opportunity and turning the Tanzania to be "Mabana and watchers," since the areas they use to leasing the farmers for the purpose of agriculture only without making them become land owners. Others have gone far, they own land not to develop and use it for the purpose of getting loans to the bank, loans which are not going on the land to be for agriculture, rearing or even building industries when the land could be used for production of property and the country to get income and people to get employment. We have also witnessed that there are owners who own more than five plots that were sitting for many years without caring about the presence of the law that wants to be advanced within three years. Those plots are using it as a business where they have a monopoly for more than five years, later on selling them at high prices while the government divided and selling them so that citizens get rid of the residential problem. As a result of that situation in the new areas like Gezaulole, Kisota, Tuangoma, Mbweni, Bunju, Dar es Salaam to today, since the grounds that will be held in 2003, have not been continued and turning into a string of criminals. There are other areas like Gezaulole and Mabulla since the grounds are given to the citizens for three years there is no sign of starting the construction. That situation has also seen Mbezi Beach where it is more than 30 years since the grounds are given to the citizens but it is still a prayer. While people are suffering from a high price, there are many Tanzanians with money to build houses, they don't have land to build, therefore the aim of the government to reduce the residential problem continues to knock down. We ask the government through the Minister of Lands, Lukuvi, to address this issue of those who have land without developing and ensuring the law is bites by being done in areas without caring for the position of the owner in the community. We are saying that, because there are rumors that there are two government officials and even the business people have big areas and they have not advanced while poor citizens, getting problems in the construction of residential areas, agriculture and rearing. The act of people count on land while others don't even have a small piece of food, it is causing hatred. That situation was left to continue being the same as making a bomb that came to end many, the ones that are not there. It is good to take a caution early before the danger occurred. The current law requires people to develop land for construction within three years, to work with actions, the government should not put on the land and the law to charge huge taxes to the owners of those areas, which will start being used to work every area.

These are just some of the things that make many women have a difficult time in wearing this morning. So as to deal with that problem, I believe these tips will help to deal with the responsibilities that you have and at that time getting time to joke. First, you are supposed to buy costumes: 'Foundation' which is easy to paint with moisture, Keith, brashi and mascara. Do you fight to wear quickly without damaging your activities. Start by painting 'Foundation'. The use of this trend helps to hide the scars or black in your skin and leave you with a good appearance. The easiest way is to paint the Foundation in the face of the forehead, diplomatic in a pair and mastermind. Then take a spill or make the lines in the face until you do well in the face of what you need. But if you don't have enough time you can stay in the future. This will help you to improve your view of your skin. Secondly, it is advised to use only one color of Keith. The most important thing here is to look if you have black patches around your eyes use a special order to hide it. And if you are not left to save time. Also, you are advised to have a little bit of Keep in Nyusi, then a little bit of mascara in your ope, you will end up on the side of the eyes.

The careless behavior of parents affect the growth of the children, one of my students had told me that she desires for her children to look at the Swahili films, because they don't have ethics but he is unable to fulfill his dream because the neighbors and some of his relatives are disappointed. "The teacher I wish you so much my children will look at this film, one day he came to my son and asked me this mother's meaning? I told him that he is a child, my son refuses and said why the artist X was calling the artist Y Baby? "He told me. If a parent should control the use of communication agencies because they can destroy your child. Agencies have been used well to have a great contribution to the development of Mwanao. They are programs for children with mental and moral children. These programs to be Swahili or other foreign languages are supposed to be given a great opportunity instead of the incredible programs that we have not helped any child. We are also parents who we won at the end of the week then children are not happy. Our work is to look at news reports from Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN and other international channels. When we finish the news we move to the England league, and we celebrate the day with Bundesliga. We do not hesitate to look at news and different games, but we must remember that your children should be given an opportunity to watch Tv and considering that most of the children are in the end of the week. Your habit of holding onto 'remote control' and repression of your children to watch Tv has developed the habit of selfishness and not to cooperate with others. Don't also be defended by your young children as a big child when you leave him with the quote of managing television until it will come back. It can also provide an opportunity for your children to watch Tv to neighbors where he can learn similar behaviors. Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of a generation with characteristics of Ukakasi. Behaviors that have been a nuisance on the streets, school and home. Unfortunately no one is trying to know what the cause of these amazing behavior by their youth. Many parents have threatened to mark the movements of their youth without knowing how to take action against the problem. There are also parents whose responsibility of upbringing has defeated and decided to leave the globalisation of their children. These are the parents who praised their male youth that they are going to go and when they get hair, bleeding ears, laying on the disco hall, wearing a mileball. The fact is that there is a great relationship between the successive Child and his character in general. This is the fact that many parents don't understand or have knowledge, but do not understand. Experience shows that students doing well in school have been caused by the upbringing that consider ethics from their parents and the community that surround them. The decline in education level especially in primary schools has been contributed by the upbringing of parents to their children. Currently, we are witnessing a big number of class seven students finishing without knowing reading and writing. In addition to that there are other reasons that contribute to that situation of decline in the success of children, but parents can't help them with that problem. The main reason that contribute to the bad development of the child is absenteeism for retailers and permanent. The problem of absenteeism affects students whose parents do not have time to monitor closely the development of their child and education. I had to ask one teacher in Mwanza; is how many parents arriving to school at least once to ask for the development of their children? "There are parents who come, but they are very few who don't have even 10 in a total of more than 400 children we have here, even when you called them in the sessions of many schools they don't know," he said. Regarding the relationship of good behavior and success in class, this teacher continues to say: "In the whole period of my service as teachers, I have witnessed many students doing well are those with good behavior and those doing badly are those with behavior and behavior to tackle them." His point is supported by another teacher from Hai District who said: "We become a close teachers and students whose parents are following the progress of their children and provide close partnership to teachers."

These are the reasons for many youths to fail in work interviews when many youths were facing a problem of not confident the amount of failing to use their talents, that challenge has been the cause of many to fail in interviews (interview) at the time of asking for work. Last week I spoke to the director of one company to highlight the workers from Arusha, Ismail Nassary who told me that the ability of Tanzania to express themselves in interviews is a problem despite being many who have appropriate education and experience at work. He insists that his company usually takes the responsibility of teaching how to express themselves when they go to interview. The big problem said that it is not confident for the citizens of Tanzania, an issue that makes them lack of employment they want. He continues to clarify that one of the questions that don't get hanged as required is the one that wants to tell him who is (question: Tell US about yourself). He says that the question is the only opportunity for the man to market himself according to the qualifications that he is doing and why he should be given work instead of another person. He says many have been threatening to explain their names, all schools they read until graduating, then they conclude by saying "that's All." The director says that the question is broad calls for a man and other things to explain his reputation in the work he has requested. On the details of that director, it is clear that there is still a big request for professionalism and confidence to the students that complete different colleges. That is why there is still fear of implementing the EAC agreement on the free speech of people (Free Movement) and employment because many opportunities will be taken by Kenyans and Ugandans whose English language is adding confidence. What makes a lot of confidence in Tanzania is an important speaker of English language. Many have the professionalism required but they are unable to confirm that they know and they have the ability to work involved. Interview needs preparations and know well the work that you are asking. When you get in interviews and Ukawa you are preparing for an amount of enough to fail and remain criticize that those who have worked on bribery they have more ability than you. The fashion perspective during interviews are crucial. There are two main benefits of wearing well during the interview; first, it is adding confidence. Several research has revealed that the good people in front of people think more than those who don't like. Secondly, it gives you an important point during the interview. When you go to the interview room, the first step will highlight your view. Don't be inspired they will believe that it is for the work that you ask even if you have all other qualifications. It is important to have a good view during the interview so that you can find a chance that you expect. Apart from the intent of getting work, it makes them even people around you to have a positive view on you. Together with all important preparations, confidence is the weapon that is supposed to break during the interview. And things that give him a courage during the interview is to know well the work he has requested and to know English language in order to communicate well and to highlight them. But it has been a problem for Many People when interviews are happening in the language. Despite Tanzania, we use English language in learning of secondary education and universities, many don't use this language to speak. For example, some of the work offered these days will tell the applicant's reputation to speak and write English language. Talking to writing is two different things. For many, we know English of writing but talking with fluency is a problem. This is caused by that we did not use that language regularly in talks. We must look at the habit of speaking English regularly especially students so as to place themselves in a good position to use that language. In addition to the importance of our great language of Swahili, we still cannot ignore English because it has been connected with the system of our life. By recognizing that weakness, the government introduced the Employment Services Agency (Taesa) which one of its responsibilities is to prepare the youth for interviews. This agency is important but many youths do not use them as a link to their employers. There is still a chance to learn and make corrections when there is nowhere well. If a youth struggled to learn something new daily especially for reading books. Please keep the habit of reading books regularly. Peter Elias is the author of this newspaper.

Some of the mental patients who were receiving treatment at Mathari Hospital concerned to provide treatment to those patients in Nairobi, Kenya, have fled to the hospital due to a strike of doctors. Reports indicate that more than 100 patients have used the opportunity of the strike to escape to the hospital. Doctors in the country are in the strike demanding their government to pay the cumulative increase of salaries and other stakes under the agreement that was signed in June, 2013 and the appropriate time for the year 2015 on improving the working environment. The strike has affected all the hospitals that are run by the government in the provinces and the National Referral Hospital including the National Hospital of Kenyatta and MOI in Eldo. Senior health officials in the government, the day before yesterday held a emergency meeting at night to prevent the strike but they did not succeed. Health care is standing in another step, thousands of patients in public hospitals in the country are suffering without treatment due to the strike of doctors and other health workers. Reports indicate that other patients in the public hospitals in that country have been forced to return home, to look for treatment in private centers whose cost is high. In the year 2013, the health sector in the country took some of its services under the county authorities, that step prompted the public hospitals to be under the supervision of governors. However, the Ministry of Health is still running the national executive hospital including Kenyatta that is in the west of Kenya. Since the health sector is under the management of the county, the health services seem to have diminished, nurses and doctors working on strikes every time to complain about poor work environment. The tension between the Central Government and the county about the provision of important equipment in the health centers has also increased the health sector in the country. The ministry has been urging health workers to oma to save the lives of patients, to give them time to assess the solution but the request is seen to be ignored. There are no reports that were given by Wiara about the treatment situation in the public hospitals where some of the governors are threatening to cancel all the jobs that will participate in the strike.

It is to bring up a friend to put as a winner in the position of choosing there. My question is there. You find that there is a big group chairpersons, you know what it happens only we need to choose one and the writer who are there is giving them three chances of the elections so if they will have banana next to it, maybe the team seems to take more students more than the ability. So another criterion used is that they are dying because of their own quality so those of the top For fish to come up to chat and then your second choice to sue the result?

On the first of May, after twenty years ago on the basis of the employees of Tanzania, today they join their colleagues around the world during the May first celebration which is used to talk and evaluate the achievements and challenges that they face in the implementation of their responsibilities. A source of this Day began since the 19th Century in the United States and spread across Europe and then around the World are workers to oppose a Long time of work and want to have the right to interact. Workers were suspended for hours sometimes up to 20 per day. Employers complained about not caring about the interest of workers and even their work environment that many lost their lives at a small age due to the diseases that was caused by poor environment at work. The first party of staff was formed in 1827 in Philadelphia, the United States and his biggest role was to suggest a special time of work. It continued the formation of the same objective and when it reached 1866, 30 parties held in Baltimore, America and formed a federation called National Labor Union. Three years later, was called an international meeting of workers in Switzerland and was formed by the International Federation of workers. In 1876, another international conference was held in Paris, France and is the one that hoped that May first will be threatened as World Workers Day. Since then the claims of the work hours were hot and even the solution started, it came out many things including the adoption, and poor life thus wanting the existence of systematic changes so that the workers control the main ways of accountability in production so as to eliminate the exploitalist of capitalist. The history of May first is long but it will not only inform us that the claims and complaints by workers is of the past century and have been taking a new chapter as every single challenge is resolved. For example, the original challenge that produced May first of the hours of work, although it is still a problem for several countries especially in the world, significantly. Servants understand their time of work and for institutions whose work require workers for a long time or all, there are shifts. The big challenge that is in which has been a cry for go and go back is for interest and now there are suggestions that the minimum wage should be 750,000 shillings per month. But there is also another challenge as a better environment for work especially considering that sometimes a good salary is not everything to an employee because there are those who ran away from the bad environment of work and contrary, there are organizations or institutions that have been reduced due to the environment. That is why we celebrate this day with a history of demanding justice for workers, we must remember saying that justice is going along with the responsibility. We employees, from the public to the private sector, we have to ask each other for its time if we fulfill our duty as required? If we do not suspect or there is weakness, take a step. We've done it, then the chest ahead of our agrees on the basis of the law. We believe that we have been doing so, we will do it quickly the steps of economic development and the interest of employers and the employees will be considered. "But I'm not Going to do it.

A citizen wanted to know from him if that situation means that Bugando hospital is at risk and what his advice to patients, relatives and relatives of the patients who must go to the hospital for services. "First I advise the citizens that we are preparing all kinds of citizens, our guide is to answer the patient regardless of other issues of his faith, tribe or anything, for us a patient is a patient. Regarding the safety of this hospital, we are okay this is a normal step to strengthen security, nor the people that don't worry or fear that there is no risk of that level, it is a step to strengthen security, people should not worry, "explained the director.

Apart from the business that he did, he has also launched agricultural produce after getting capital from its business of selling vegetables. "I have started to grow the agricultural produce in Ruvuma province after getting training on how best to grow this, I asked for money when I paid a amount of 2 million, I decided to put this farming because Tangier uses six months to be sent and I have a plan to grow vegetables within this month," says his position of leadership as the chairperson of the Kiwi market who was chosen for a lot of votes on June 31, last year, he says one of his responsibilities is to ensure gender violence in the market is growing. Neema who is the only chairperson of the market for women in the whole of Tanzania, explains that the market has a good toilet and bathroom and that waste is collected every day and a car for carrying the waste that is usually in time and removing and thus making the market to be clean at all times. However, the tax that is collected in Kiwi market is 300,000 shillings per month and that amount is little because of the business being bad and some of the function of the market have asted their businesses from being bad. Markets are crowded? He is saying that for now gender violence has decreased due to everyone to recognize his rights. "Before being given training, some of the men in this market were to appreciate women in leadership but after getting education have changed," he says. "But I'm not Going to do it.

These cells enter into the body of a human body after a mosquito bite of Anophone. Mosquitoes with blood cells of Plasmodium when it bites someone, it gives some of the mate with infectious infections in a sore, thus spreading malaria. Those infections are traveling to the liver where you are full of maturity. There are 4 types of malaria, which are P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. falciparum. It has been given names according to the type of Plasmodium which caused them. The first 3 types are not dangerous but it is very dangerous but it can cause death quickly. This is because it comes only in the body usually makes it plenty in blood. The blood cells of blood (which spread in the body), the affected is thick and cannot get into the hashtag. This situation causes death in the brain, liver, pneumonia, kidney and a mystery because of the lack of death, an issue that causes death if he does not call it quickly. The symptoms of malaria include fever, shivering, the pain of joints, vomiting, cell anemia (which is caused by leaving red blood cells), headaches, and void. These symptoms occur after two days in the infection of P. vivid and P. ovale, while the symptoms of P. malariae and P. falciparum comes after three days. It can be accompanied by the fever that comes after between 36-48 hours or a fever that is not known but ongoing. Children with malaria are often demonstrated in a common space, a sign of brain damage. It has been discovered that malaria causes problems of identifying especially for children. They also causes the spread of sickle-cell anemia in a period of growing lussy and pollution. This neurozone is based on brain malaria which is very dangerous to children. The malaria of this type will be sponsored by white supredients, which can be beneficial as a sign of malaria and other fever causes. The World Health Organization (WHO) made a report that in the period of the year 2013, more than 198 million people were infected with malaria and it was estimated that 584,000 people died from that disease. Nearly four out of five dead are children under the age of five. Nearly 100 countries in the world are affected by this disease thus threatening the lives of many people. Estimated 3.2 billion people around the world are facing the risk of being infected. In order to deal with the disease, scientific experts have noted a new way to sign drugs to kill mosquito nets. That way has succeeded by 100 percent in dealing with some of the types of mosquitoes. The international research report says the way that uses solar energy energy to paint medicine enables nets to carry out high levels of medicine. "But I'm not Going to do it.

"Let's go back and who was born with him," died. " "No, we don't ogwa but I think our movies were blocked, and the keys have land." Those are some of the statements that begin to take our ears to the ears of Tanzania to discuss the future of the country. If you hear those statements, you can end laughing and resolve them as a joke. But you have taken time to reflect, you can join them with those people. Currently, how can you explain the "wisdom" of the Olympic Committee to fill out more leaders of athletes in the convoy of our representatives in the Olympic competitions of the summer which ended the day before yesterday in London, here in England? While our colleagues are coming back with several medals, while Ugandans are proud of a gold medal, we have continued to vote on the "reputation" of our being the head of this madness. But you thought that the decade in our participation in the Olympics, then listen to this "great" from our Parliament we call him "glorious." Last week, the deputy speaker of parliament, Honorable Job Ndugai explained to the citizens that some of their representatives in parliament (members of parliament) have been getting into the sessions of the legislative body holding alcohol and non-cigarettes. Before we have gone far to discuss this terrible report is good we remind one another that according to the recent amendments, the honorable members of parliament are paid 11 million shillings per month. It is important to mention that level so that when we discuss these people to have an understanding that together with the poverty of our country, we have decided to give them their honorable members. In some way I congratulate the Deputy Speaker Ndugai for bringing up his eyes on the question that I think many citizens have been asking, "why some of the honorable leaders seem to be in parliament while the session continues?" Online has been full of photos of "butter sleep in parliament" and there are many honorable members who like to change the parliament to be part of sleep. Some of us saw the pictures of that kind, we tried to make it hope that maybe the honorable members are overwhelmed with sleep because "they are focusing on how to serve their voters, and perhaps the country in general, effectively." Likewise, Ndugai's statement has helped us give us a light on the contributions of some of the members of parliament that a citizen cannot be blamed for the role of Bongo Star Search for the talent of hits. Instead, but that's the truth itself, some of the honorable members takes advantage of contributing an argument to show their competence of ceezing, insulting and even devastating. But what happened in the Job is "advocacy" that, (I quote) "members of parliament are people like other people, they have a habit like the other human beings, there are some who in the way I feel to go to the parliament especially the sessions from the afternoon they have made beer." First, our lawmakers are not the same as "other People." It is "other people" how many people are called "honorable"? And how many are the allowances for fulfilling their duties (despite being paid salary in their positions)? And it's "some people," how many people are paid, though significantly, they are more informative, blasphemy and other propaganda that do not help a Tanzanian? Ndugai is not right to claim that members of parliament who visit the parliament are understood "they have a habit like the other human beings." As a student is not allowed to enter the classroom as I understand. Even in the drinks "baamedi" is not allowed to get to work. Now those "human beings like others" tells us the deputy speaker from the planet? Then for an absentiment is the fact that the deputy speaker is aware that there are members of parliament to go to the parliamentary sessions if they understand but they don't have any steps but he is waiting until he gets a chance to place the issue in an interview with the television station. This is a weak leader. Although we can congratulate him for "leaving us the secret of what is happening in parliament" but the bond that he was given is not pointing the finger (in a sense of noting that there are members of parliament, but to take appropriate measures against "criminals". And it's not like I used the Word "criminals" unfortunately. Not certainly. The person who is paid 11 million shillings as a salary of representing a citizen, then he decided to do that representation while he got several beer, or he has stolen a non-cigarette smoking?) or he has given certain things ("flour" -drug abuse?), he does not have a criminal. It is a robber who causes people to live with problems in order to maintain its interests in the expectation that those interests will bring success in work but he is threatening to implement his responsibilities while having a "profit head" (kit)! In one of my articles in the past, I put my stand that the largest salaries of our MPs is a robbery in the day. And now the robbery is proven by the ridiculous of some of the honorable members that ignore the principles of parliament and their responsibilities, and to appear in parliament to understand. But there is one basic question that every Tanzanian is supposed to ask ourselves, "how did it take a place to some of the parliamentary elections in parliament." One reader of this magazine, Omary Abdallah, a Tanzanian who lives in Germany, used a message through Facebook that he advised that instead of continuing to blame the bad leaders, we need us to look at our weaknesses that makes us choose leaders not to stand up (for example they drink). In short, the reader summarizes that the nation has been plagued by fraud and Values. Back to the parliamentary campaign. You'll see the candidate "coming from sweat in the body and the evil horses" to destroy the voters how he cares for them. And in our thinking of thinking, we did not questioning whether the "bitterness" of the candidate is for our interests or his stomach (and maybe "small house"). The results are the ones that we are told they are representing them when they are drinking, smoking or feeding them. But also, in this form of addicted to some of the members of parliament, I see the income of the honorable members to be among the factors to inform their responsibilities. In a normal environment, a person who is given a lot of money for his needs can end up doing incredible things. As the diaspora is witnessing some of the scientists, for example, who are paid millions of money, and there is an appropriate time to show that "bugs" that are done by some of them are caused by plenty of money that do not meet their normal needs. Additional lawsuits seems to have been met by the public. While doctors and teachers were told the government does not have money to improve the benefits and the environment of their work, we have not been given basic reasons to increase the salaries of members of parliament who already had huge salaries. The performance of many of them is not known and even "little" what they were being given before new salaries. It should be remembered that millions of our members of parliament are the money for the taxpayer who most of them are poor. There is every reason for not only to condemn "exploitation" but also opposing it all. Now, as we allow the parliamentary seat to be a direct approach to the wealth, then we will expect to see our elections in front of us and all kinds of folks among those who want to be part of the "project of chap chap" (GET-Rich-quick scheme). In a normal state, who does not want to be paid at least a few thousand shillings for the sleeping work while you have two three beers in the head? It's like going to the bar then unpaid. I request it should be understood that not every member of parliament has its responsibility. There are a few patriotic artists who recognize their responsibilities. Some of them have threatened to "adopt" by Kiti's speaker for "violating the rule of Parliament (isomed: To defend the interests of voters in an unprecedented way to the leaders). These few heroes are brilliant, as they are married out of fulfilling their responsibilities, they are witnessing some of the ones left to continue with sessions when they were sleeping due to a drink, non-cigarette smoking or getting certain things. I'm hoping for a return to the questions that I quoted in the beginning of this article. Tumerogwa and who killed him in a ogwa then died, or our minds were shut down?

Two months ago, I had a funeral in our village, Kamageta, Rorya District, Mara Province. When I went, I was surprised to see the photos of President Barack Obama of the United States in the walls of many my brothers. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. In our village there is no electricity. In all the days I had never got a television broadcast even one day. But listen to radio. And my brothers are listening to radio well. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. I, Ezekiel Ochido Peter Kiri Liech Kami is a mjaluo. Kamageta is a scholars. And although Barack Obama is far from us, we are still in Japanese are our brothers and followed closely. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Those pictures of the flags were the same thing; now the Japanese is leading the whites in the United States. Because it's a luxury for a human being of a sore knee. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. A big question that I would like to tell the readers of this article to get answers though a bit of today is about these people known as Japanese who one of them become President of the United States, the biggest nation in the world. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. First, it is understood that the Japanese are found in approximately 10 countries in Africa. These countries are Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Central African Republic and Sudan. In the imagination, the Japanese origin is Diding'a on Dog Nam, the word Dog Nam has the origin of the Ugandan tribe of Uganda (part of the Japanese tribe) which means it is the same as the word Dhonam for the Kenyan and Tanzania. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Until today, the Japanese from around ten countries have not agreed, what is often talked about. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Except various researchers say that the lake is known as Lake No or by another name River Palugo, although in the Arab world known as Bahr El Ghazal. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. For many years Japanese have lived along the Nile river and the outskirts of the lake which is called Nam Lolwe (lake with water that goes to the end of the world.) This is the British who came later to beat Lake Victoria. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The Japanese is not a tribe which has increased soon. There is evidence to the religious books to show that they had been there since the tragedy. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. For example, you are coming from a book of a 12: 5-6. That while a student Yepta, Mgileadi, when he was leading Israel made one big thing to identify Waefoot before killing them. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. After arresting people, he ordered him to say the word Shibboleth. Ordinary Wael were able to mention the word Shibbolethi but Waefoot failed because they had gone to Sibolethi. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Why did they say Shibbolethi? There is one big reason. The people of Effect and Manase are the children of Yusufu aliens and a woman from the Egyptian country (which is also known by the name of passion). "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. For studying in the Bible, they will know something about the passion. This is the Prophet Mohammed's child who is alleged to see her father was naked. Instead of praising him, he grew up. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. That is when Nuhu has laughed. It is said that West Ham (Egypt) is where he went to put the black child. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Now Yusufu is giving birth to there. Unfortunately, children born in Ham (Egypt), their first language was not a bright of Jews. That is why they failed to say the word Shi and instead they were telling Si. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Those who have ever talked to ethnic groups such as Japanese, Waacholi, Christians and Ariluk, hope that they don't have a word.. in their words. They told them to say the shirt themselves say no. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. There are people who are flirting that "Ah black as a whip." That the Japanese are black to obey. But this is not a shame for mjaluo. Basically, in religious books, among the most beautiful women in the history of this tribe, Astarte discusses the king of King Suleiman in Mithali's book; "I'm a Beast and black." "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Basically, black is something to be proud of in ujaluo. Names like Ochol and Rateng have one meaning in Swahili; black. Names such as Oteng (Jorge) explains the lineout that God Jok (Jamaluo were trust before white and Arab religions have not entered), was killed by using the black soil, which is found on the front of river Kiir (Kiir is the name of the Nile river. Kiir is also the second name of the president of South Sudan Salva Kiir. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_35468155 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Those involved in Zanzibar should be punished by the president of Zanzibar, Doctor Ali Mohamed Shein recently has been warned the people of Zanzibar especially the youths on the danger and the dangers of not respecting the law. While in Pemba he met with the citizens at the celebrations to commemorate 52 years of Revolution and warned those who broke the law that at the end of the day they will find themselves in trouble. He said the security agencies and especially the police force did not like to bully people, but it has no patience with people who are wearing the law. This is a good advice of a parent to the youth and especially as the leader of the country because the law must fail and be respected. By doing so, the excuse of breaking the law is removed. If citizens see the law is bad and it's not going to do what is needed is to protect and build arguments to make corrections. However, we should not forget that the issue of respecting the laws of the country is about every citizen and the guest and they are not expected to get hanged among the big and small, rich and poor or the love of someone to the political party or soccer club. The problem that is in Zanzibar and which is seen to be engaged or not being given the required weight is to be directed to the existing laws. This trend has caused some people to feel like Zanzibar, there are people who are on the law and they have the right to take their colleagues at their heads and to make them. Not one or two or three have heard reports of people in their council of talks being attacked and beaten without reasons. There are some who were hurt and treated for hospitals and in all the events, there is no even one person who was arrested and held responsible for those crimes. A list of these kinds of events are long. Some of the council have been broken down on the excuse of making a garden while others that are near those were not touched. Here it is alleged that it has been used political will and not the laws of the country. We all remember several events of Zanzibar journalists being threatened and even beaten. Also, one radio station located in Unguja Town was attacked by those who are told they are hooligans and arrested, but we have not heard that those crimes were arrested. When there is a situation like this person is asking, these laws in Zanzibar should be allowed to have a group of certain people and it is permission to be filtered by others? If he said the law must be allowed, but the need to be for everyone and not someone or a group of people seem to be above the law. Also, it is important for the law to be seen that they are doing the reasons for the accused of violating the ones held quickly as required by the court. Here, we must remember that someone remains to be a suspect, anyone who has been sentenced to death as a culprit until he was found guilty by the court. Therefore, the bail of the suspect in different charges except a few, usually the right of the defendant. The terms of bail some of the times are given the terms of bail which is the same as telling the defendant not to have the right to get bail. For example, we heard with the right to put on bail is Serikal servants. In that sense, the people of Zanzibar have been divided in phins, one of the civil servants and the second payments are those who don't work in the government. This is not a little right and it is not giving the shape of the good system of law and good governance. He has been in complaints of existence cases and some people are languishing in prison for years as we heard the investigation is not completed or is on the ground to be completed. This is encouraging the good governance and inappropriate governance of law enforcement, they denounce this trend by telling us, "Justice delayed is Justice denied," that is the right to be released is the same as not being granted. In order for the law to make the work intended by the citizens to have faith in the law system, it is a must for justice to be done and there is no abuse by anyone inside and outside the court. The style of people to have the courage and decide to keep their faces and then screaming is against the law and it is unacceptable. The explanation that those who do that are hooligans and therefore people should ignore them even when their backs are being sold or their houses were found no logic and it is unacceptable. In Pemba Island, there was a huge destruction of house arrest, the farms of people being attacked and cloves. Who's the ones involved? Many are said about the events and what was witnessed is silence like what happened is small things. These are saying this and those saying that some of the accusations that are heard is thick and are not being ignored. It is good to clear the weather and the truth of this issue, it is good to be formed a independent commission, it's not for the people of Zanzibar, to look for the only truth to investigate who was involved. By doing that is everyone who will have faith that the law of Zanzibar do not discriminate or get married to anyone who broke the eyes on this excuse or what. While we celebrate the 53 years of the revolution whose aim is to put the state of citizens equal to removing discrimination or injustice of any kind, it is good to make an evaluation on how the laws are working in the islands. That evaluation should have a broader scope and I'm excited about the law, but even how employment and education positions are being given by the government. Another thing is the issue of the delivery of the Zanzibar identity cards. This needs to be monitored in detail and the terms of terms will be able to eliminate complaints about the provision of identity cards. Among the things that want to be monitored in detail is why up to today thousands of people who and their parents have been born in the Island and have never been out of Zanzibar, they are out of their identity cards? It is surprising that people rated to Zanzibar in recent years and they do not have the graves of their parents in the Islands, they are amba and have their identity cards and become more people of people who were born and left. The government thought that there are many people who were given identity cards contrary to the law, but we have not heard even one of them or who have given them responsible.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_58124502 What happened at the international meeting of Davos Feb 07, 2014 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Recently, President Jakaya Kikwete attended the annual international meeting in Switzerland in Davos city known as the World Economic Forum (WEF) or Davos. This meeting that started on December 22, 2013 is 44. They attended nearly 2,500 people including presidents, government heads, heads of international companies, investors, heads of international banks, economic experts and a few representatives of civil society. They were in the 80s and millionaires who don't be counted. Their total is 1,500 when government officials are 48. African rulers are in every year to attack aid and subsidies or attract investors. All of them are out in a luxurious hotel that is in the mountains of Davos. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The agenda of the meeting had a topic about poverty, unemployment, water, treatment and social protection, as well as climate change. The aim is to bring economic and social development in the world, as they say. IF 2014 report submitted to the world's biggest threat today is an increase in differences between the rich and the youngest, the wealthy and more poor people are fast growing. Participants discussed the topics in 250 meetings that took place. The wealthy people have confronted ideas with politicians and scholars on the purpose of protecting and strengthening their capitalist system. That is why they were willing to pay 250,000 dollars each to attend the meeting and be members of WEF. Civil society are invited and are allowed to select the way to improve the system. Ten Naidoo, an activist from South Africa said "I'm usually invited every year and WEF without payments so as to show that our contributions are trusted. He is the leader of the international organization for protecting the environment (Green Peace). It was also invited by OXFAM organization which presented a very important report before the opening of the meeting. The organization's research has shown that one percent of the richest people in the world are owning 110 trillion US dollars, that is 65 percent more than the property owned by half of all the poor people in the world, it is more likely that while fuel are growing, the rich and more people are growing. For example, Bill Gates who should depend on him as our big sponsor, last year its capital increased by a sum of 15.8 billion dollars and to 78.5 billion. The results are now taking the first position in the world that he had lost. This one Gates in its 25 pages report says the world's situation has been restored, that poverty is reduced and that poor nations are starting to be independent instead of depending on aid. He predicted that by 2035 there will be no poor country in the world. He has forgotten that every 20-year-old child is dying in the world due to lack of clean water and greetings. That is why the Director of OXFAM, Winnie Byron told the meeting that "it is a horrible thing to be in the 21st century, three and a half billion people are owning a little amount than the property owned by a few wealthy people who can spread in one bus of passengers." OXFAM added that this situation has been caused by a few wealthy invading property by controlling the political system, it also uses a way to control the economic system for their benefit. OXFAM warned the rich of Davos that the fight against poverty is only a mere words without making sure that the difference between the rich and the poor doesn't increase every day "this mixed causes causes resources to continue being controlled by a few wealthy people, when we remain fighting for it, we live in a community where better treatment services and education is controlled by a few people for their benefit and their children. This seems not only in the poor country but even in those countries. Pope Francis also warned that incredible revenue as well as the allowance and allowances of the horrible scars are a symbol of the economy that is full of greed and minority. He added that without equal opportunities (political, social and economically) for all our communities don't live in peace. He rebuked the community where many people die in hunger when food is burnt because there is no market. He said "theories" claims that the growing wealth of a minority under the Creative Commons system will benefit the poor. He warned that the system of worship for a few wealth will cause many people to cut up and the community like this will not live in peace because the poor will face it. "I pray to God to come to the politicians that are deeply saddened by the poor state of our citizens," said Pope Francis. But in Davos the words made by OXFAM, Naidoo, Byron and the Pope as usual were put aside. Ungetexpected otherwise in this meeting that was attended by senior leaders of the world's wealth and ruling the economy, politics and policies of our countries? "But I'm not Going to do it.

Every ordinary citizen is going to war. He is fighting for life. Every day in Unguja town you will find people who do not have employment to leave the streets or in their house. The pockets of their rice will be empty with their heads and their minds to find ways of getting next food. When you go to the farm will find the same situation so that the weakness are facing the citizens. When you go to Pemba, the things came from it. In general, many of the people of Zanzibar have remained as they don't know what they should do so that they can get the ways of intimidation. It is a great exam that you find. Undoubtedly it is not a visitor in Zanzibar but this close years has been changed. The responsibility of reducing or closing away it completely is the government and especially it is the minister of finance and his ministry. The minister gets the opportunity when he presented the government's budget in the House of Representatives. Next month the Minister of Finance of Zanzibar, Yusuf Omar Mzee, will submit the first budget of the national government in the special sessions of the House of Representatives. As it is for the budget fees, that will explain the estimates of revenue and expenditure of the government and it will also put strategies to combat poverty, to promote the economy and to bring development in general. The people of Zanzibar are hoping that the budget will be very different from those in the past decades which have contributed to protecting this current state of Mchafonte economically. We have already used to the budget when it was presented to the House of Representatives to hear the government that it was introduced as the economy of Zanzibar has been inking and growing. The government provides its official statistics to try to confirm that. Sadly, it is that the status of the lives of citizens or are bringing up to the way or to sabotage. Therefore, the explanation of the growth of the economy are empty stories because it cannot be confirmed. This is because there is a huge weakness in the collection of independent statistics, that is those that are not given by the government. The country's finance minister is facing a lot of challenges when he prepared the budget of this year. The other challenges are short, sometimes for an average period and others for a long time. First, in a short period of time, he is taking responsibility to address the issue of deficit of government funds. The remaining challenges, that is those of the average and long time period, of course is to implement the plans that was organized or that will be prepared by the government so as to enable the economy of Zanzibar to get relief and start growing. The people of Zanzibar know that the future of them is good because the long-term economic growth of the island is good. They have that belief because they say they will increase investment from outside and they are focusing on the expectations of the creation of independent economic areas. There are signs or other signs that are also encouraging, like, for example, hope to be found in fuel. However, it is important that the economic disease affecting the citizens are given medicine in the June budget. It is important to show that this government's policies do not differentiate between the previous governments, that these policies tend to serve the citizens. Secondly, it is important that it will be done so that the people of Zanzibar can donate to the future but their economic and social welfare. If we have already forgotten in this mid-fielder, the National Union needs, again for emergencies, having a "easy food policy" so as to meet the daily needs to enable the citizens to get food. Other things that need to be investigated and tested keenly is the standards of tax and taxes, transport costs and more taxes twice - and Tanzania Revenue Authority and the Tanzania Revenue Authority. The people of Zanzibar have the desire to see how their finance minister will be playing political parties about the leadership of the economy. They have that desire because of the state of things that is right now, that minister has no ability to read that he will know the standards of income tax, customs tax, currency activities and banks, delivery of industries and businesses and the whole issue of the central bank. He also said that the minister has no way to grab international funds that are provided by institutions like those of the World Bank and the Department of International Monetary Fund (IMF). The current situation continues to implement it in implementing the long-term plans to boycott the national government's economy. Neither the government will not be able to bring development in the economy of independent areas. Indeed, the economic system of free areas is needed for the islands of Unguja and Pemba and not in areas of Fumba and Micheweni alone because Zanzibar is a country with a small area. In fact, when Zanzibar was with the economy of the independent area, an independent area of the economy was both the two islands and the effectiveness found on the two islands. Neema spread across the world. It is important to remind "EM that in the colonial era of Zanzibar, it was insufficient without depending on the colonial state. Therefore, it was able to donate its social services, it was able to pay the salaries of its workers, building hospitals and secondary schools. Likewise, the government was able to form the infrastructure that brought him at the same time. So that it can be able to take all the steps of meaning in the economic and social sectors, and even the political, the government of the national union does not have tricks but to start a quick discussion inside or outside the new constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania that will start being used for five years after being accepted. The aim of that discussion should be to bring about the authority and the economic and social power of Zanzibar which have been divided for a period of 47 years in the union. Unfortunately, the coalition government did not use the power to take the whole project in Zanzibar with the flow of economy to its citizens. The coalition government up to now has been the most active member of parliament whenever this defect is mentioned. The power of Zanzibar that brought in the union should not be resolved then Zanzibar will not be able to save his economy and the economy will continue to sabotage and even courts. At the moment the economy of Zanzibar has a lot of irregularities: A large number of people who do not have employment, a large number of people who don't have income to enable them to use money, prices of food, oil and other products. We must also remember that Tanzania mainland is not a big business partner of Zanzibar as it is in China, for example. The current situation is that Tanzania mainland is involved or connected to the economy of Zanzibar on the network of law and regulations which are in Zanzibar the ability to control his economy will be. Therefore, it cannot make a good wall when you want to donate to its social welfare. Then there is an issue of corruption. This is a tragedy that the United Nations government has the ability to eliminate and it does not require the excuse of returning to power from the coalition. Corruption has become a cancer that has spread across Zanzibar and the Minister of Finance must use every way to fight. There would be reliable and reliable statistics of corruption in the country and how it kills the economy of Zanzibar. The government claims that Zanzibar's economy is growing by six percent (6%) every year. Corruption is growing, growing at the same level or more? In the past Zanzibar did not have corruption as it is now. This disaster has continued due to the uroho of the government servants, the department that was directed by the government service that has employed several thousands of staff, bureaucracy that have been able to use money that would be used instead of using education and health services and also help the fuel especially in terms of paying the high prices of food. That's the beginning of the first government of the National Union in Zanzibar, it must prove that it is following the new numbers and not the past. The people will be waiting for the results of that budget and to look at how it will affect the non-employment, poor and poor poor. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

"But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. According to the news, for now many residents of big cities in the country like Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Tanga, Mwanza and Mbeya, are facing non-infectious diseases easily because of the use of food and drinks that do not consider better nutrition. Also, the news explained that the lack of food that is not nutrition, causes various diseases such as diabetes. The problem of consumption and excessive consumption is largely in major Cities due to the Disease of Food and drinks, and also lack of time and areas to do exercises. We support the statement of health professionals, including non-communicable diseases, that there is a large number of people with those diseases, but they don't know if they are being sent. One of the specialist doctors, Doctor Rose Hyness, says the investigation that was done by the institution that deals with non-communicable diseases in the country, has shown that in Arusha province, 30 percent of adults, are faced with diabetes, which are caused by not doing exercises. Furthermore, we support the statement released recently by the adviser of health issues in the country, Doctor Ali Mzige that the current system of life, affects and destroyed many human beings. Doctor Mzige mentions several issues of doing so as to improve health and avoid various diseases that are not necessary to include leaving smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol. According to Doctor Mzige, smoking of cigarettes are in a big possibility of getting more than 40 diseases, which are dangerous to their health, such as ugly, cancer, tuberculosis, heart, oral and eyes as well as hair-dropping, while drinking alcohol causes 60 diseases such as the liver and reducing 4 CD for AIDS patients. We are fulfilling the health testing activities to continue in all provinces in the country, because many people are patients, but they don't know and they don't want the hospital to be treated until they are overwhelmed; a situation that is causing sometimes to lose life. It is clear that many people, especially low-income earners, do not have time to test their health due to the focus of life. Many of them feel a mild, hample drugs or buying drugs in drug shops without testing. When they are overwhelmed, they may be in the hospital and were found with serious problems, thus it is difficult to be treated. We ask the government to continue to enable the citizens to test their health; and if possible it will build a special day of testing the health, as it reaches the day of cleaning that is every end of the month; and a day of planting trees nationally. We insist that the major methods of dealing with various diseases must be reversed and exercising their body daily. We do exercises without limits. "But I'm not Going to do it.

Grahamstown: South African city where the feelings of discrimination is still intense on May 31, 2012, there is a big and clear issue among the mixed communities of South African citizens, the remains of racism. In everyday life, there are still people who are seeing is satisfactory or Zambians, there are those who claim to cry for Africans and who don't have stories and lives of speculation such as coloureds. When you meet and trying to see a white man, it is normal to be told that you come from Africa, especially after introducing himself that you are Tanzania, Mozambique, Zimbabwe or any African countries. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. For them, South Africa is not part of Africa, perhaps it's a piece of Europe that fell in this continent! In Grahamstown, the situation may be apparent. In this town there is a hall of disko named Rats and Paraguay, (mouse and Kasubi). Here, those visiting are empty Europeans. His neighbor is at the Equifrium Hall whose opposite is African (black) and their music is the origin of this continent. This town which is the headquarters of Makana Municipality, on how it is seen is the same as any other one in Europe in the weather of uberity and built. But as Zambians seem to be more, they believe that is where to them! When you end up in the middle of this year and you think it has got a real state of life in this nation that has built after through the rule of racist, you will have ever reached a decision; because things are more than that. Mister Mbuleli Mpongole said that he is a Xhosa and a host in this area, and his work is taking round the tourists. Without chew, he says: "If you end here you have a real life situation, the real situation is on Twitter. But before that, he took to the building that was built for a ship as a memory of honor to the thieves that arrived in Africa for 1800 and their contribution and generations to develop the nation of South Africa. The Building was opened in 1962. Perhaps in showing that discrimination is still abandoned, Mister Mpumalanga gives a different translation of this building. He says: "This is a ship that came with it (mastermind), there is a day we will take them to them. How come the sea and return to them, we don't know, because we are not calling you! " But he also points out the Anglican church building that was built for 145 years, due to the fact that Africans were carrying bags and other construction equipment by walking on foot and sometimes bread of being fired by animals from the Indian Ocean. He blamed that the current government, under Blues, has not stopped revenge and if he would have made it. He asks why the government should give the same amount of allowance for survival in Europeans and Africans (Blacks), despite the fact that during the Blacks regime, they got half of what they were given to white? In the Swahili area of Makana, that is where the Blacks live. The majority of them are rapists. When I was there, I was trying to connect with the Mwenge area you will be at home in Dar es Salaam, but it is different because while South Africa have been organized. However, life is hohe doesn't go home. "Life is poor. Many of these houses are stalls, but for now the government has developed the housing for the disadvantaged ones. We called Mandela's houses, later it will be called Mbeki's house and I think that for now they will be called Zuma's house; because everyone gets into his name, "says our host Mpumalanga. These houses are mixed. There are those that have been built on the support of the government and it seems beautiful, but there are also iron sheets. The most popular chapter of these are that almost many have electricity and are striving to have domestic furniture, and sometimes sets on television. Also, this area is the one where alcohol is indigenous, popularly known as the name of the U.S., huts. Another twist is that, here is no Mchaga store, all of them are forced to go to buy things in big shops known as malls, even if it is a thigh of chicken and chips. That situation reminded me of the step of Dar es Salaam and Mwanza to dismiss them. I wonder; the move was for the benefit of who? Because this is taking place, the shops of this type (malls) were ongoing to take it to the country. Ms J.W. Bouser is a lecturer at Nelson Mandela University, located in Port Elizabeth. He says that in these Swahili areas, there is no peace, and it is not safe to visit. The situation is visible and the fact that they are rare (Zambians) in such places. When you enter the bar in these areas, where even the music is beaten, you discovered something else; it is that the bottles of beer here is big for more than those that were used to Tanzania for half a liter (500 mililita). Here is just three quarters of the liter (780mililita), but in the Europeans, the ability to reach 380, although the price is almost one of the most effective differences. Lord Vulkie Teyise, in charge of the Tita Memorial Center between Waxhosa and Zambians on April 22, is showing part of this center where Blacks were working in the era of the Muslim thieves. He says no black was allowed to move there more than those arrested against the rulers. He says that in those fights, also known as Grahamastown war, Blacks were killed. During the fight, the leader of Xhosa, Nxele was arrested and later went to prison on Robben Island where he died in prison. It is in the prison where Nelson Mandela has also been jailed. In another area of this city that has been built, there are Indians and many of their houses are African. Mapokela says: "I don't know why these people are volunteering, and their houses have this color. We are our colors we are trying to show that the father of the city has gone to work in mines, therefore the community gets his wife! But they don't know what they mean. They are people to engage with each other! " But maybe their lives are in this municipality, are those of the macheters (Coloreds). They are their houses are cold and pieces of iron sheets, and that is where drugs are being sold and dirt ended. It is poor life and nothing you will be compared to us. Although there is one high school teacher claims that racism stood in South Africa, and that what remains is just a feeling, but the real situation shows that the sin is still in this country with great development in Africa. Maybe what to ask or ask is President Jacob Zuma's administration has the strength in running this country, and to take this sin? But another one is that when you see the poor in this country usually is hohoon, because he does not even have a stir. The big land has been taken by the rich, and the confusion is that they are buying their needs in the alls with great names. Do we know that the development we are running for? I ask that; because we have begun to give land to investors, and we are also dismissing them to allow them to pave way for major foreign investors. "IT's "IT's "IT's "IT's

In a situation that was not expected, the cadres of the Revolutionary Party (CCM) who are calling for presidency have shown great discrimination in finding sponsors inside that party in Mwanza province. A thorough investigation that was done by Good Citizen this week has revealed that many candidates have continued to flow near every day in two of the seven districts that form the province to search for sponsors inside that party. The districts that many CCM cadres have been arguing almost every day to look for sponsors in the process of requesting to be appointed by that party to vie for the presidency, is Nyamagana and Ilemela that form Mwanza. Until the day before yesterday, Nyamagana and Ilemela districts have been blocked with more than 10 candidates, with five others, some of which have not been reached completely and others have been blocked or have one presidential candidate, or less than three. Other five districts that seem to be chosen in those movements of searching for the leadership of the country, Kwimba, Misungwi, Magu, Ukerewe and Sengerema. The secretary of CCM, Kwimba district, Tabu Lugwesa, told the newspaper that until the day before yesterday there was no presidential candidate who arrived in that district to look for sponsors. "Until now there is no presidential candidate even one who came to look for sponsors here, Kwimba, I don't know why, maybe it is because our district is next to you," said Lugesa. Likewise, there is no presidential candidate through CCM who arrived in Ukerewe District which is the island in Lake Victoria to look for sponsors inside that party. The chairman of CCM Ukerewe District, Ali Mambile, has told Good Citizen that it may be geographical of the district that has caused the presidential candidates to flee in the process of searching for sponsors. "While (Ukerewe) has not arrived for a presidential candidate even one, we haven't seen us, but I think even the geographical we have done is a problem, I don't think there is a candidate with bad intentions and we," said Mambile. On his part, the secretary of CCM, Magu district, Bangcry Pangobu, has said that until the day before yesterday, the only presidential candidate who was in that district is the minister of construction and the member of parliament of Chato in Geita province, Doctor. John Magufuli who got 38 sponsors. However, Pangobu has explained to not be surprised by that situation as a result of what he explained that the procedure of finding sponsors are not at home nor to marry his presidential candidate in the district to go. "There is no transparency, where candidates should go to look for sponsors, so far as Magu has come to Doctor. Magufuli alone, came on June 10, this year when he got 38 sponsors, but they may come to other sponsors, "said Pangobu. Also in Misungwi District, the cadre of CCM who went to look for sponsors are the former Minister of Energy and Minerals, Professor Sospeter Muhongo only who got 45 sponsors. The secretary of CCM, Misungwi District, Donald Magessa, has confirmed that saying "who came up to look for sponsors until now (the day before yesterday) it is the only Muhongo, I see that he is very careful, he does not want a celebration." At least in Sengerema District until the day before yesterday, it had attacked three presidential candidates who went to look for sponsors inside CCM. According to the secretary of CCM Sengerema District, Mohamed Shabani Mohamed, the party cadres who arrived in that district to look for sponsors are Doctor. John Magufuli, Ambassador Ali Karume and William Ngeleja, who is the member of parliament of that area. While those districts, especially Kwimba, Ukerewe, Misungwi and Magu have been faced with "discrimination" in Nyamagana and Ilemela districts have continued to lead by being attained by many CCM cadres who are demanding the presidency. The secretary of the parents community of CCM Ilemela District, Faisali Dauda Hamadi, has said that until Monday, nine cadres had arrived in that district to look for sponsors.

A few days earlier, the passengers on one plane in the United States were asked to leave emergency on the plane after the Note 7 phone started offering smoke. Samsung has suspended the sale of Galaxy Note 7. "Because the safety of customers is something we are paying more attention, Samsung will urge all distributors and its suppliers all over the world to stop selling and also exchange for the Galaxy Note 7 phones, the investigation comes," the company has said. Samsung says phones affected are nearly 2.5 million. According to the company, 45,000 Note 7 phones have been sold in Europe and many in England. More than 75 percent had been transformed by its owners, given another Note 7 or other Samsung plants. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

"But I'm not Going to do it. The condition of the presence of the general elections of the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) that is expected to take place in August this year is the one that is mentioned by some of the analysts of soccer issues in the country to be one of the something that produces a lot of bugs right now. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. He wanted to return to the benzene to some of the leaders and other leaders wanting to get into power has made leaders who are in power right now to forget their responsibilities to Tanzania and focus on campaigns to defend their seats. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. This is what makes football making a lot of fun, not another. Every leader in power is looking at how he will be part of the next mainstream leaders. If you don't have the leader of this way, expect to meet with the "movie" you are witnessing this time. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The events that we continue to see is due to lack of concrete leadership that would be able to prepare well and to manage the ball themselves so as to avoid the situation. If chief leaders are not concerned about what is going on, who will come to the unknown location? "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. If we have come here, we don't have a verness. The leaders of TFF have been held hostage and they are running as they want. If we had a strong leadership in charge of the interest of soccer in Tanzania, we should hear that we heard about it now. We were focused on talking, writing the success of Tanzanian soccer, but it is not right, everyday is just a problem! "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. While the leadership of Jamal Malinzi led to a trap, the problems are continued to increase. Whenever it ends one month to another month, the problems are confronted as months. They rarely ses without any problem inside our football. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. What is trying is to be said that leaders themselves have been keen to meet with stakeholders to deal with challenges, instead the leaders have been hiding in their offices being beaten by "AC." Although the advice should not be treated, but the stakeholders are required to be heard. I do not believe that we can make one house then let us wait for them. I didn't believe it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Forget about all the previous problems in the past, the issue of Simba and Kagera Sugar clubs scrambling for three points is something that makes the headlines for soccer, though yesterday the issue was expected to be released. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. This issue has been heavy and made up to the people of different soccer institutions to intervene and others showers up to the fingers. But the size of this issue has been led by TFF and its committees which have been unable to manage within their regulations and instead the issue moving to the will of private individuals. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The regulations of the Tanzania Premier League (TPLB) are very clear if it will be known as a player has played three yellow cards in the past games are not allowed to play the following game and playing his punishment is known. And if a player did not have a card basically there is no case that can make people more careful to share it all the time. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The report of the referee is the last decision to believe in every different event and the ethics of the soccer game must be reached within the report. It is said that in that report of the referee shows Kagera Sugar player, Mohamed Fakhi, got a card in his team's game against African Lyon, but the player himself has opposed that he was not given a card that day. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The confusion of the 72-hour committee by the committee of law and dignity of players about that issue is from where the referee is unable to be heard? A shame that is in our football were called up to African Lyon that was played by Kagera Sugar, went to be satisfied with the evidence. If we do not want to trust the report of the referee we will believe the report of someone else? "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The rally together, Fakhi, African Lyon and bringing in front of the referees is to look for evidence of violence that cannot give you the right answers to the report of the concerned game. TFF and his committee had to comment on this issue by using only reports so that everyone is getting in the development of building the Tanzanian football. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. It is only Tanzania where you can meet with this situation and those of Tanzania are not aware of it. But despite this situation, it is now time for TFF and its committee to review some of its regulations and to leave the team to win the table. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. It makes the flavor of soccer to the team that gave everything that we have for the purpose of winning the match on the field and later they have denied the victory. TFF and his committees are not doing well the regulations of the team that will make acts of this way to meet the fine, but the winning team should stay with their victory. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. In this, the members of Simba and their fans have been priority to say even the youth squad "Serengeti Boys" is going to Gabon for the table, but those people were supposed to know the appeal of TFF to the youth team to the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and Simba's appeal to TFF and its committees are two different appeal. These are two different appeal. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The Congolese national team of Congo DR, broke the taboo for making a player with a big age "bold." And the punishment for this way are open to CAF that is why we did not feel the noise from the Congolese fans, they knew they have done an offense and they need the punishment for removal. But the part of Simba is the issues of torture only, but not Kagera Sugar denied their victory. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The issue of Simba, Kagera Sugar needs wisdom of what was written by the referees of Kagera Sugar and African Lyon. All the other we see, we will be fool. It doesn't matter whether a player was given a card or not given. It doesn't matter if the referee wrote a player he got a card or didn't get. We need to trust the referees reports. If we do not believe their reports will help. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_47325052 CCM will be history with this nonsense Dec 30, 2015 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Last week I said that it is impossible to have a political party that wants the consent to lead the poor people then it should be running as a rich party. For a long time now CCM has been running its political issues as it does not know the importance of those who are led or who got consent to rule. The party that has decided to leave his ideology of liberation and loss of ideology, it will not be able to continue doing so, because those who decide whether or not to be in power is the last decision. For several years there has been a tension in the ruling party about what is needed to happen in every aspect to be political, economic or social. The tension that was there and which will still continue the existence of the situation that we witnessed in the general election campaigns that brought him to power the fifth term government of Doctor John Magufuli. No doubt, even a little that the ones who call themselves blood members are aware of that and they have already made an evaluation to know why the party whose candidate was winning for a landslide in the past years suddenly, getting a 58 percent victory which is a sign of the collapse of the party's popularity. There is no doubt that the technique that he used Doctor Magufuli during the campaign to market himself without leaning against his party was good and invented with political professionalism. I know there are some who will not be impressed by the fact that it had the candidate that he was presenting himself as him but the truth, you will discover the truth and that is when that candidate will emerge with victory. After that victory, one issue is very clear and very important to CCM, it is that after that happened? Is the party a nanny to stay silent and pretending that it doesn't know what happened? What has happened to what happened now, which way is right to assured them to remain in power as the ruling party in the coming elections? Evaluation of the situation with the expectations of the party in the future is an important thing that should be done by calm heads without papara or mage. It should be remembered that CCM before the system of many political parties to be returned here in the country was the party. The meaning of the party is a political system which the party is not only one in the politics of the concerned country. That party is what we stand by the government to implement the policies that are derived from the ideology of the party. The party does not have the last term in every issue of political and social life in the concerned country. Nothing is being done by the government that the party has not accepted. That administration system made sure that the party has a strong and great ability to even continue the government in every sector and that is the reason they were formed secretariat of various economic, security, money etc. The secretary of the secretary were the main units of the party that we can compare with what is known as the day of the day to open up (think tanks). These are teams that are made by experts who have great ability to enact policies that are taken to government officials to resolve them in actions. The party to hold the power of government leadership means that nothing has not been given the blessings of the party that can be implemented in the country. That is how the situation was before the political reforms of our country in ninety years and for sure the conclusion was in the amendments of the constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania which agreed to be returned to the political system of many parties here in the country. It is clear that CCM was not prepared to enter the political system of many parties and its results are that many things done to be done just without a good procedure that would be assured of even in the political competition. The party which had the ideology that is in charge of the interests of the weak, farmers and the workers is to be released on the hands of the pari-colonial agents. That took place in an environment in which the international paramedics had been united around the world and there was every kind of pressure to make sure the political parties of the left-wing political parties as it was the Party of Revolution are telling the orders and run their minds. CCM still got a lot of application in a very basic thing that is ideology. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

"But I'm not Going to do it. Published: 02 October 2016 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Soccer is a game with many fans, especially youths of different ages. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. It is an indisputable fact that the soccer game has had many fans in the world including the fans of Tanzania who are ready for anything including having gone into money for the reason of getting the game. There is no sin to love sports, but there is a need to put boundaries between encouraging sports and to do the work of bringing development to themselves economically. Because of the sidelines, they're in business where fans have been blogging the results of the popular game like "Tibetan" and they are willing to use all the money they have in order for the participants. Just like this issue to me, it will end up until today I decided to talk about it, it is also as seen as the government that seems to lose the power of the youth who some of them have decided to focus on gambling instead of performing or involved in using the funds they get in betting. The Deputy Minister, Office of the Prime Minister who deals with labor, employment and youth, Antony Mavunde recently explained his disappointment with the behavior of young people who are using a lot of time to specify the results of sports and using a lot of money for a luxury. Mavunde has urged the youth not to lose time to play that gambling and instead they use the money to specify the results in development issues. I join the Mavunde of that, it is not a secret I don't understand the youth or people who do not forget and playing that gambling and lost money that they would have used to do the meaning of development and uplifting the economy. I mean someone is working again to be enough or the suffering gets a bit of wages, the same time he uses to go to a gambling that has no guarantee of getting, the results from the apa, money has lost and he won't win again. Again, others are following the punishment or want to show them to their colleagues that they have them when they are sleeping is a problem, he doesn't know what he does or what he does. When a young man left these things, do things for development. There are places where you know they are young and even the adults found to go and go to Tibetan, you are now talking about non-meaning, until you wonder if these family members and if they have a loss. A whole father or a young man from home is saying you are going to work, and at work they are going to get money for gambling! It's not good enough, you must be knowledge, mind and knowledge, this life is not to play and lose money. You can say it is your work, your money and your decision, if you are okay and if you are traumatised by your problem, but if your life itself is to support you and you have a family, then you get money going to play for a gambling, there will be no one who will carry your problem. The Deputy Minister Mavunde has reminded me, and I open a knowledge, you must have goals in life, remember those who refereed that games, they are doing business, themselves they are losing, you are losing, because the gambling is not a guess. I don't have no dispute with someone who works and get enough money for himself or to fulfill his personal needs and for his family, then he has extra money to play for a gambling habit, but if he has no additional money then he makes his money in that style then I apologise to you. Young people grow, work with the aim of self-raising and bringing development to them in good things that will bring benefits to the private and the community surrounding them. The luxury is at the end and its end sometimes is not good. Work for you. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_46733105 My eye: Control over the child "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Written by Stellah Nyemenohi "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Published: 02 October 2016 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Among the news that was painful in this week, it is this about a church leader in the village of Kaseme in Geita district, who was killed by suicide after allegedly killing her daughter by sprawling Bakora. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Reports are saying that Mbappe is an evangelist from the African Inland Church (AICT), gave a punishment to her 15-year-old daughter who accused him of engaging in violent acts. It is alleged that he sent a seven-year-old daughter while standing on the road speaking in that environment, he started sprayed Bakora. Witnesses claim that he went to home where he blocked him inside and continued to punish them by beating up until he was in the soul. Poor, when he noted that her daughter has been in the soul, he decided to run away and when he arrived for a distance of approximately one kilometers away from the scene, he hanged himself on the tree using a hashtag to death. The eye has witnessed these reports in the press having been confirmed by Geita Regional Police Commander Mponjoli Rodson. The media reports have quoted some of the people who know Mbappy, who many admit to remain with a lot of unanswered questions about this incident. Some told me Mbappe that he was a good believer in a criminal record. For sure it is sad. May God rest his soul in peace and continue to comfort this family that lost two people with a shooter. When this religious leader was in front of justice, the incident that caused the deaths, is a lesson to me and you. It is a great lesson not only to parents and guardians but anyone with the authority to punish them. Of course, questions about the event, where they are stolen from spiritual perspective, the answer comes as a "devil" .there is no doubt that everything with negative results come from the devil. In this event, the devil came to fulfill the truth about the phrase of "anger loss." There are a lot of events that parents, guardians, teachers have been found guilty by giving punishment for anger and the results of assault or killing. There are many reports that have been reported about such events. Among the events that I've ever read in the media is together with the mother's mother in Tabora province who is investigating his child on a banio of charcoal. The four-year-old child was under investigation by sparking careless and ignored at home. A mother reduced the legs claiming that it makes me laugh. If you look at his guidance, there is no one who loves her child. But now, the way used to rudi, was led by anger, the mother was found guilty. Another incident I remember, is one woman in Mtwara province who mocked her four-year-old son for eating gay. He took the leaves, prompting him in the hands, and then went on fire. The mother was interviewed, he supervised the foundation that he took that step to inform the child. Nobody wants her child to save, but also, the punishment was brutal. No wonder it had an inspiration for the negative economic situation. But that is not the protection of this parent to be taken against them. I believe there are parents and guardians that they have found themselves with severe punishment for their children believing it is right without knowing that they can be turning their preachers. I agree that anger is a situation that could affect anyone depending on the circumstances of an issue. But it is understood that, regardless of the crime he made a child or anyone else or the horse of your anger, it will punish them and caused injuries or kill, there is no defense. This is an example of the results of parents and guardians to punish children with anger, because a few days ago the parent Elisha Sumila (35), has been jailed for seven years in prison for the mistake of beating her child by beating him two teeth and caused severe pain. That judgment was given by the resident magistrate court of Ilala district, John Msafiri who said that the court was pleased with the evidence given by the prosecution after bringing five witnesses including the doctor and that the judgment should be a lesson to other parents doing such acts. The primary thing is to learn to control anger at the time of punishing children without caring about various issues that cause the situation. For example, among the worst incidents of parents or killing or injuring their children, you will find some suffering from psychological problems and other economic problems. While everyone needs to control anger in taking any decision, the community should help in saving and save children against severe punishment provided by a person who failed to control his anger. The community is supposed to overcome the style of ignoring a parent, a guardian or anyone who is giving a stern punishment to the child, thought that they are not involved. For instance, for instance, Mbappe is an evangelist, as a community, including her family, would have intervened when he took her daughter, the deaths would not happen. There are people in our community that we live, they are known and is popular by giving punishment including great language to children. But it is common without knowing that one day, those acts can cost the lives of their children. We accept the fact that, anger is poisonous to punish a child or even an adult. Therefore, we should learn to control anger and be so much when we give punishment. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

"But I'm not Going to do it. The images of the country is predicted by the existing circumstances. Likewise, citizens of the concerned nation also have a very big decision on how their lives will look like. Due to that, I wouldn't worry to say that Kenya is a good example of a country "with a stack of waste." Yes, we are just an example the country is known as a result of evil deeds in our society. The real image has been released by the residents of our institutions, especially the authorities of the towns-in-making of their critics and sanitation facilities in the cities. In the past few days, we saw the residents of several cities in the country complaining about the increase of waste - on a level of even failing to continue with their normal lives. What is clear is that only a community is sick. Our illness is moral. For example, despite being given a warning of not driving cars when they drink, the warning is taken away. The cost of not responsible while it has been to continue from road deaths. An example of this is an accident that happened in Salgaa area, Nakuru, on December 31, last year, in which five have lost their lives. Basically, it was noted that some of the youths had lied to their parents that they were going to the church. And when an accident is not immune, they were drink, along with driving the vehicle without a license. For me, the accident could have been blocked, if the regulations have been followed. It is shock that those youths lost their lives while still young. In the book "Enemy of the People" (the Result) writer Henrik Ibsen describes one city in Norway and not responsible for its chief managers. The residents of that town were forced to drink dirty water, as a result of water management unit in that town. Kinaya, the mayor of that town, Peter Stockholm, was on the front line to block one newspaper against the crash. Those supervisors even seem to be ready to give a bribe to one doctor in order to explain the truth about the health effects that water would have had to the residents. "But I'm not Going to do it.

The state of safety of products that are imported into the country through the port of Dar es Salaam, especially in the parking lot and downloading goods (TICTS), it is not satisfactory and some of the business people have started to flee the port and start using the port of Mombasa, Kenya, Good Citizen has noted. The investigation that was done by this newspaper confirmed that many business people have already passed through their products through Tanzania, for fear of the theft that can be seen in the port. This situation seems to be affected by the business people from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) who most of them are now threatening their cargo on the port of Mombasa. Those business people who are from Bukavu areas in Congo, at different times have confirmed to be affected by theft at the port of Dar es Salaam. Apart from those businessmen from Bukavu, others are from Lumbumbashi areas where they have fled the port of Dar es Salaam and decided to pass their cargo in South Africa and at the Beira Port in Angola. Speaking about that situation, Bernard Makita, who is one of the officers from the Democratic Republic of Congo in the country, who is also the representative of the Government of OGEM (equivalent to Summer Tanzania) says that situation is dangerous to the economy of the country. "Dear brothers, it is better if the traders have taken the responsibility because the things that are taking place at the TICTS is disappointed because the theft, which was not made in that company," said Makita in shock.

In that loss, it is alleged that the only one was found in one military camp in the country being empty and another was found in Ubungo, Dar es Salaam city, having already been opened. He claimed that for a period of two years ago, there is a loss of approximately 40 containers of business people from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The shootings are off "on the hands" of the TICTS. The author of this newspaper when he made efforts to search for speakers from TICTS so as to talk about accusations that are directed at that company, those efforts did not bear fruit, as it was for the efforts that took place so as to get leaders of the port authorities to talk about those complaints by business people.

"But I'm not Going to do it. Published: 27 September 2016 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. The report that between January and August this year have occurred 6,971 accidents and lost the lives of 2,217 people and others being left injured and they said they should be taken seriously. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. We agree with the statement of the deputy minister of internal affairs of the country, Hamad Yussuf Masauni when he woke up when he launched the road safety week yesterday in Geita province that it is good for road safety to be a national agenda. We are saying any good action that will help our nation to come out in this case that allows the safety and life of our people to be supported by one statement and every one who is happy our nation. Masauni, in his speech instructed the Tanzania Roads Agency (TANROADS) to remove the penalties on the main road that has said they have been seen as part of the sources of road accidents. The ability to remove the roads of the road, we have and if we see that it brings us more dangerous instead of the initial aim of reducing the speed of buses and other vehicles that are on the road especially in dangerous areas and ferry security forces, then we should lose to pave way for the risk that faces. Also, the call that was given by the deputy minister of requesting all the road users to follow the law and road regulations with the keenness that you have, you have to be considered by each one of us. Those regulations include to stop using high speed, crossing the ferry of pedestrians and cyclists and children crossing the road while under control. But the report that was given in that event yesterday by the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communication, who is also the deputy chairperson of the National Council for Road Safety, Edwin Ngonyani, that human offenses contribute to 80 percent of accidents and following up to speed that also contributes to 12 percent of the accidents, it should be done. What is the human mistake that we cannot work on deliberately with the aim of controlling in order to save our people's lives? Why are the reasons for the humanitarian mistakes we should be required, including being taken to the media to find what they have to do with the relevant crime? We still believe that the phrase of evacuation is that 'the union is strong and separation is a weakness' still benefit in dealing with the disaster, in solidarity with those who cause humanitarian crimes and continue to lose the lives of our people and make their own lives. The passengers involved, the police of road safety and the government in general, we tried to act, we will be able to win the tragedy of the accident and the ability we have. We should not accept to release a few people who are intentionally without caring about the law and regulations to continue being finished. We should not accept the manifesto.

Our leaders have also developed themselves well and most of us know their real colors. Sure in one way or another we have been confronted here by everyone because the citizen has a contribution to us here. Our dollar and its agencies also have a contribution in bringing us here, our political parties have also a great contribution to us here, here we are not a good place, we don't want to be proud of the level of people to be in public, not to respect, not loving, not trust, a large extent of selfishness and hatred and everyone to avoid responsibility from citizens to citizens. Let us start accountable if one person, we ask ourselves and think about where everyone is wrong and we don't have a simple response that our minds will start to give us like, it is a government, it is a political party, it's rich, it is a certain tribe, it is a certain region, it is certain religion or sect. When you get there, if it is a parent I will tell you that when the last time you explained to your children the beauty of their country in Tanzania? When did they tell you how Tanzania is a unique country in Africa and the world? And if you are a citizen to come out and start giving a finger to others I will ask when when the last time you participated in your local government sessions and you will participate to identify the opportunities and obstacles for development "Opportunities and obstacles for Development (O & OD)" in your region?

Speaking about the authority in this elections are being managed by two different authorities, returning to the constitution of the Republic, article 4 that talks about "authorities of the country" in the meaning of the United Republic under the National Electoral Commission (NEC) that involves the elections of the president of the Republic, members of parliament of the Republic of the Republic and the Mwadians of the Tanzania mainland. The Zanzibar authorities under the Zanzibar Electoral Commission (ZEC) has a bond of coordinating the elections of the president of Zanzibar, members of the House of Representatives and councilors. In the two different elections, both parties are supposed to put its managers all over the country to manage election activities that are constitutional and legally they have the authority. The translation of this explanation is that even Zanzibar National Electoral Commission (NEC) presented officials in every station to supervise and run the elections of the president of the United Republic and the republic. Alongside NEC, ZEC put its officers to supervise and run the elections of the president of Zanzibar, representatives and councilors in all stations in Zanzibar. Even the stations is one area but it is two different authorities. While the results of the election results going on under the Zanzibar Electoral Commission (ZEC) received several issues which in one way or the other led to the chairman of the Electoral Commission of Zanzibar to delete the presidential elections, representatives and councilors. The chairperson of ZEC, brother Jecha has given more than eight reasons, I will explain a few reasons, first, when the exercise is continuing with delegates inside the commission failed to "know each other" in a lighter language while Tanzania Mainland, the delegates of ZEC were left with a fight. The chairman is going further to say the delegates of ZEC were killed by homosexuals and started running the fields, if it is not enough the delegates of ZEC will go back to their allegiance and to start flying the flag of their political parties.

Tell me your eyes to take it now, how will you be announced to be announced to be given to small things that we are doing every day to benefit themselves We were with Mike thanks very much, I think of course the youth are following closely so we start with a big paper, Innocent Mungi, very close to you, the donation I will talk about it very well and there is nothing we say now is to help the industry we are recording and airing the aircraft. There is a communication channel and there is a link to communication services you can get television on radio. Amen in a phone you can get radio on what technology has signed The people who were studio in the radio can be following are following the announcements and people sent a message that you do not get the attention on twitter, people have communication starts when someone is in the studio, but people are Kibiti in his period using the message now it reaches a place where we started to see even in the radio programs here in the moment, people are sending messages with messages. Which is very difficult early in the difficulty of that ehr to an ordinary person cannot solve and you find someone reading here says not mi It is Mike, you find you going to listen to Mister. Now this situation was contributed by the small professionalism of communication services the communication authority has the ability of example In order to prevent such a centre like that you do to feel like or be blocked, but we look at our development still in technology, I will not accept you now below. We know the whites are saying that we have brought up, there are people who are not used to live with us but come from. Not having anything until using phones will go to the internet so there is a sense of people wanting to use those services without even looking at its use, I think the reader will agree with me on Twitter orleans bed they have the terms of joining them and explains that there are a hall I think I say ten and seven years there are ten and four years.

To enable people to know that In-law or social media It's like that in the past we were sitting at the buinge, they call it 'I don't know if they were at the binge on the bottom of the Zionist trees when there are the elderly until today they are drinking it, it's just depending on that they are saying that they are going to go up for us now there was a place where Israel live there is nothing else to get and there are other football things that are talking about different things. They are different from which we are called Physical Social media. Now people came out than had to insult the public as it is in the Grade. They don't know that you are insulting now on social media that it has been connected to computers and all phones in the world that have internet. Why do we know that we don't know that first but second there is something called SELF Regulation and responsibility. Personally and look at what is good to do, of Course we wanted people to understand that everything you have and I on Facebook there are friends I have arrived. I see I cannot add to others that I say something or five thousand you feel. One other than it.

At the beginning of last month the documents of Panama that killed the whole world met the scandal that will differentiate between them and scandals that involve one country. A bunch of 11.5 million documents are reports of more than two hundred thousand foreign companies that are in the list of Mossack Fonseca that share owners, shares and heads of those companies. It is normal in the business system to run a company outside the country he is from the owner but it is unacceptable to be normal about Panama's documents, it is the wealth of various leaders in the world have been buried and it should be noted because of course. Previously they were mentioned a few senior officials and their relatives, but later it comes out that the Virgins islands are owned by the British and Hong Kong islands where they are flying from the ground. Owning a company outside the nation is not a violation of the law but those companies have been used with crime including tax evasion and corruption. The cover of the crime was opened by a reporter who named "fake" John Joe "who exposed the issue publicly, in the German newspaper of Scandinavia ddeutsche Zeitung earlier last year about the dirty game that began in 1970. Later the documents were distributed to 400 journalists through a union of investigator duniami (ICIJ), in 107 media houses in 76 countries. As it was in the ancient aftermath of Esopo, where they were blocked in mazon (Pandora's Box), which was controlled by the first concrete woman in the world (Pandora), which was controlled by soil and soil, but then broken down the world's evacuation, Egypt, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Cyprus, Egypt, France, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Indonesia, and Israel. The other is Italy, Malta, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Tunisia, Ukraine, Arab Emirates, Britain and the United States. The ownership of the company outside those countries and the protection of their reports and small tax charges, has been used badly for the benefit of the bloggers of those countries. Mossack Fonseca that has three hundred thousand companies is being used for playing those documents so as to stop its customers, to prevent the identity of owners and mysterious accounts of the use and benefits so as to prevent them so affecting the economy in the world. The gap between the rich and the poor has increased by the tax evasion that is needed while the biggest victims of the developed countries, that lacked income that are estimated to reach 213 billion US dollars in the month of July only last year. Mossack Fonseca claimed that it was tortured by the internet but after the documents started to get involved with them, the professional order reveals that it was playing for the internet for documents that are not known to hide the truth. The person that leaked that secret said he decided to do so, so that the world knows the truth although until those accusations have been handed over to be completed then it is known to his reditation. The names mentioned include the UAE President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, King Salman of Saudi Arabia and the Prime Minister of Iceland Sigmundur Gunnlaugher. There are also former leaders including Sudan's president Ahmed Al-Mirghani, Quatar leader Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. Also the former prime ministers of (Georgia): Bidina Weishvili, (Iraq): Ayaq Allawi, (Jordan): Ali Abu al-Ragheb, (Quatar): Jaber Al Thani, (Ukraine): Paylo Lazarivo and (Mumbai): Ion Sturza.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_38074593 Welcome to our discussion, I don't understand with me, lucypatrick _ e with young people and topics that we will talk about today's day is that young people are using the opportunities that they are getting in their lives near why they are called Catherine tooli. Five, what is the best and I don't know what they are getting received well for a good example, all the students know one minute Boom we call a loan to get a loan, many students know that you will get a loan to get a loan so that you can be able to increase the size and later maybe it can be entrepreneur or even though it is something of the meaning but he did not give the head of this big scientist who gets going to use he is gone to do shopping drinking alcohol when he was shocked. This young man should use me, he will use well that is if the youth use my money was done but two things that you have never thought about the series of posting you have left afresh in the negative side, you know these days you try to blame the government that he doesn't enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to enable you to The environment for them to come out to be self-employed as the government has not called a good environment from the university to be self-employed is possible to be dependent or the government is going to produce a nation of people who are coming to be dependent on Tanzania and Tanzania. It wouldn't be a university we thought that from the university to self-employed while on the street, we must be able to get employment since registering a white number r cid as we get problems. It's going to say it's a fraud on social media As a young man or the day that is not good because men had to be monitored, I can discuss to get out, but we look at that side the citizens that the government is unable to organize his youth well so that I think I have said afresh and the structure of curriculum. It's not enough for us to be independent, take an example of a lesson you know also mi in a cultural style of fish Mi is a Tanzanian, there is no need to train you to tell you that is the team of Msimbazi River in irrigation farming through software So that the training is? Another one should tell us to say the farming of maize yesterday or even think about it at home Because Dodoma was surrounded by I find the desire to bring in the maize I will go to the street every kasoma to study the child he will listen to class four to three hours if sikosei is taught to provide electricity using battery and battery. To pick up the Rivers, I don't know he is making my grandfather to make the men feel like to make men And the youth who we have finished technical education in the evening you could come to be self-employed more to electricity and reduce the problem of sports, Tanzania will not be able to wear except increasing many readers in Tanzania. It is the first class teachers to do Fresh from School to someone. He was living with her father until I am not with her. He was a college of bogus that we had given. The integrity that we want to ring there is Mziray the Best wants to sell his recommendation, a whole person who is full of upbringing because you find the teachers and the student being used there. We see the Chinese to come to invest here for us and why are the use of why they should not be sent to them here and us see you want to make sure there are young people in Kariakoo to get Chinese. Completely selling flowers _ selling FIFA will do one job that the economy and it is removing that number of economy of Tanzania has been in a certain extent but you see you still have a very difficult life and I think if a young man who is a young man who is the main job of the nation had been prioritized in the issue of agriculture like agriculture is the head of the back. Tanzanians We link to the plantations until this hour since we got here, there are many areas until this time we have not reached the forest but the government has decided to give money and invest in the benefits of agriculture and take the youth like that. . That's a good thing because a young man in the air and discover you can work then I think a person who does work I don't think if he can be convinced there is no good goal that I am convinced there is no good goal that I am supposed to have a family in which way or it is required. I mean, I wouldn't use fourth when he used to form a form that he will be doing stupid in class six to consider the studies because I don't have an animal to make many youths fail to use the opportunity. One of the misconceptions that they had been given dire to tell God that maybe he should be a leader. A small village but now he knows that the young man who was vying for him in the leadership level may be ogwa or those people who maybe were fighting with the following day. Mi think the main reason that yesterday the washing machine is also a bad system or in the commission. You find you as a young man for later you want to be engineer But a parent should have explained to him and he is thinking for later to have everything he needs. Go back in kasome maybe? You will be read we didn't financiers in expectations that the teachers can't help him As a result of why this poverty is at home because he can be depending on something in these times, a Tanzanian is going to read as engineer. He believes that if you want to go to study teaching you will help the family but also to be self-employed Let's ask you a nation later in their lives but there is no such thing for our many families. This young man is unable to reach what he calls young people who are required to use your thoughts in which they Put the best from who? For example, a young man may be able to get education for his studies and national ideas in general But the parent or the sun He has no capacity in developing I was there. The resources are not. Hundred told me But mi is a young man who is afraid to tell his wife he was crops and that one cow can take the shape since the benefit of my life I told me that the father has not told me that they are wrong with the theft and the issue that several coming down to tell me that a cow's house is a luxury tomorrow we will do? Now we need to stop so I know that I have been taken to read it up to me. Mi think that Be peace So personally that a person is that to achieve goals We should not give up and we should know that everything is. It is a must that you be reached as if you pass the areas saving the private goals, we are the youth that we believe and we participated in the area where we will cause us to do a good things that I can call for now we have then we should use you. If they do not have the same, I want to read then toxic. Because there are other people who can follow up until you want to be who doesn't know that, that is the rest of us, if the youth must understand that what we need but find out from my heart, then let us use the position we have. To achieve goals but also for our families, parents should realize that we are things that will look for later in the opportunity to build good muscles to be able to reach. Social end, let's stop the concept of a young man who is looking for Brother in making it The World later post worked hard by asking the Course he puts on it. A young man is also an opportunity to read at that time when he came from, he sees clean things to check every day because he knows home. Thing Next? I am given Jackson the opportunity for the use of technology as youths we use it accordingly, there are better people, he uses social networks for the purpose. Very benefits that They do In studies, there are some who do a discussion of discussion in how many students are meeting, they have a confrontation of ideas, who are meeting where women are meeting, but now there are some people that you find that because of a large number of people and they have said that especially for these countries where you say not to use the cupboard, you find a lot of young people that show up on the things we sell for them. The reason I didn't know that this case has come soon to see that we don't know the effects of his hands, that is why you will find that someone from home has gone to work, he is eating that instead of using that time to serve as it is customers like maybe. It's satellite The branch is time when she uses you to get into the internet maybe I will be informed. As Facebook maybe Tira should maybe see them and you find that you find that. There are others also on the second side with them. Online at this time but it was a job hours and he was supposed to use time for overnight. Now you find that the customers have come in. When you need the services you can be able from skin, the concerned company is so busy while believing that we have found that the loss has come in approximately three because of the first.

"But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. FROM the Desk of Shaffih Dauda: One of the biggest problems of us Tanzanians is not to accept when someone has continued. Most of the time we do not ignore what he has, for example someone has a good idea to say that he is executed or kaiba. We do not accept the reality or the success of a person so as to give me a challenge at least if I do not reach or close to the next person's success. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. Its meaning is that those are the efforts of the corrupt efforts that were done by TFF to prove to the Tanzanians that we can score against Algeria something that is false. That is why I from the beginning I have gone through over 100 percent about the issue of scoring against Algeria. That is why since the beginning I made a promise that if Algeria has been given by Tanzania then I will go to prison, I have loved to citizenship, that is why I have the assurance that the issue is possible.

"But I'm not Going to do it. I will not vie for this results but on the other hand is happy.

MATERIAL_BASE-1A_79299759 Three days of citizenship education in Chipogoro, Feb 18, 2015 "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it. After 13 hours of the journey I arrived in Chipogoro village, Mpwapwa district, Dodoma on around three o'clock at night. When I was in Dodoma town, I saw one of my fellow passengers on Chipimo. Chipimo's condition was contrary to the rhetoric of the passenger who had told me there are all basic services including houses for enough visitors. The bitter famine caused by my fear of eating in the journal, which I was told the sleeping house is just one side of the road! In my fingers, I went off the road towards I was abandoned. After asking several times, I arrived. Four toilet rooms participated in. The existing electricity is the sun light and you will light the lights. I have a dirty bed. Godoro is full of joy as a mosquito celebrated steadily in a bitter summer. The toilet was very dirty while water is a problem. Around five o'clock at night, artists of the group TACCI, who brought Chipimo to arrive at the visitors' house. The coming of them brought a big conflict because the rooms were not enough, while the water was completely broken. TACCI, Tanzania Community Civic Initiative is a citizen institution in Dar es Salaam that provides civilian education. The artists of TACCI told me that the problem that I met with Chipimo are not even half of the lips that they went through their convoy for a period not less than two months in the ward and the villages of Mpwapwa district providing citizenship education. But, all of these problems are earning interest in this amount of suicide? My three-day schedule to walk and witness the work of the artists of TACCI got answers. In the morning of my first day of work after a sharp needle of a mosquito to the other, two lawyers, Clementina William and Husband, who are part of the group started a schedule for running a seminar for county leaders about inheritance and good governance. The leaders were impressed by the subject of wosia. Especially, benefits, conditions and a place to preserve wosia. At the end of the seminar, leaders urged lawyers to visit their villages and give the citizens the education. "We could be able to go ourselves but we will not explain to fluency like this," the chairman of Chipimo village popularly known as Punda of Jesus, told lawyers. After the seminar, the leaders were displayed as a sophisticated training intended to be shown in three villages that had been appointed in that ward. On the day of that day, the work of providing education through the acting game started in Wiyenzele village. In line with the paramedics, there was also a mercy on the law to advise the citizens for free to fight for their rights. In the advice which began at nine o'clock I witnessed the queue of citizens with different problems waiting to meet with the lawyers. Clear, one of the lawyers said many citizens of Mpwapwa have been asking for advice on marriage conflicts, land and inheritance while the main victims are women and children. Several times, those advisers have been receiving feedback from the citizens who are grateful after succeeding or wanting more advice. At 12.30 pm, the art show started. Four redients were displayed with different content including good governance, child abuse and children. The first chorus was a dance and an indication that it started by showing the father bought for alcohol and people who are coming later to bribe him money so that he can show her daughter with good development in education who is in primary school. The mother of a Child is opposed to receiving a glimpse while the daughter comes in shock. The second video shows that we should stand for those who refused to go to the development of leaders, husbands, parents, and so on. Citizens did not participate in meetings to discuss development believing that they have chosen leaders who are supposed to bring development without any contribution to the citizen! The third chorus is about the exploitation of women and widows. After the passing of her husband, one of the perpetrators were expelled from the house they had created by her husband as they think everything. And her sister is accused of being beaten by her husband who is an addict, but he is depending on being treated without stopping money. This sister every time he was suing, - to the father, mother, aunt - was told to be a cry. The men dragged with a child with a child to be richer for alcohol. However, the chorus ends with two fees to deal with the entire lineage that brought me the widow and orphans. The fourth chorus shows the amount of forgetting from Tanzania. It is starting with pauce, where one man narrates about one good country, rich of milk, honey and minerals but has a lot of citizens. "But I'm not Going to do it. "But I'm not Going to do it.

In addition, he said in dealing with the fire incidents, they will ensure all schools have enough protection so as to prevent those acts to continue. Speaking to journalists just after visiting that school, with the defense and security committee together with the member of parliament of Chalinze region, Ridhiwani Kikwete, the district commissioner, Majid Mwanga said they are continuing with investigations on the incident. Mwanga said that the incident is sad because the government has been doing efforts to ensure students sitting on a dormitory so that they can get a lot of time to study especially female. It is surprising to see that the dormitory of girls is reduced while there is no student or someone when the fire happens. The head teacher of that school, Justine Lyamuya said, all their equipment were reduced, including 75 beds and mattresses, all the items being worth 24 million shillings. Lyamuya said that the dormitory was built recently for 50 million shillings and in that event, five children went away after being left behind by smoke while trying to save things. Ridhiwani said, the government will ensure all those involved are arrested and also the event will be examined and know who was involved in those events to come out regularly. He said that he has already called a session on October 9, this year for education stakeholders, parents and those in order to discuss how to deal with that problem that happened on October 5th.
