The leadership
The leadership first I would like thanking the new leadership
Usually hawawapendi fourteen and for Jamal Malinzi
Led by well
But those Board his leadership because they have failed to implement a member
Like kuexport no talent search
These are in for only in urban villages they do not know
My view only
No reason God admitting tunaenda insult continues
Close
Thank you very much water is called gold
Mi I would like to talk about the more than Musa
In our country of Tanzania many people tunakuwaga and Bush
Now is the property which is to give feni which hakihitajiki here in Tanzania as we need according to the sports things then tukiingiza bribery will be is available for example unaingia at the registration thing wanaposajili clubs of different team
Simba Azam yanga every his clubs causes that directly, register people who are not histamini not well for example sipendi you maybe device stage United itself tumesajili people to give veteran five people from thirty years five karatina watasababisha these people wacheze group ball well to waboreshe national inaongelea youth coaches kinachorudisha behind
Tumepumzika behind Tanzania tunachukua high costs to buy the coach getting him out of foreign countries far than
Come to look at how these people who come to the critics are is what people who I see that very much for paying mi naonelea right of those coaches of the national team of us
Improved so waboreshe going is even ourselves can teach people came from different clubs below example if you check Ndanda
Ndanda after being five at the time of the league to be Vodacom coach dismiss and which is a priority quickly so much I thank so much
Very much
Time
A period of time is not friendly to go giving traffic ehhe end unakipenda AIDS let get the final
What should happen to believe we have opened tukachukua at all because these players lack of sports now we're going over mi nikifanikiwa taxes anayekutazama nikifanikiwa nitakupatia well
Was ready
What should happen to the prayer nitaanza first soccer athletics
At the same to the person who alishafanya athletics second beats of who this Tanzania
Yes is about now let let let bureaucracy in terms of going to choose so people mchague certain person because of this reason every day is there or because you know you will get their twenty percent ten pasenti when an important squad even in the leadership of you can choose
The election is taking place should stop bribery kuziumba dubbed zitapambana laws that leader
And also the leader anayechaguliwa should be is a leader who again right now there is a person who is all thinks, but this has been the problem also
For the very we also the corruption and bureaucracy
Uondolewe within the country but the mid-fielder of Syria pressed him to someone well that what should happen to be able to solve the problem is that the nitaongelea two things
We are the first issue of the leadership and then the second one is the issue of patriotism
That our sports tukitaka Tanzania continue tufike far must be and the leaders with the vision
The leaders of to see that he did not have a problem with our country to see that after five years or next ten our national team is doing well and second the whole issue of the sponsorship to have enough sponsorship in all the games we see in our country sa ilipostahili sponsorship in the field of soccer football but other sports I don't know bolibo netball because if there will be no no sponsorship and the sponsorship in other games and ukafanya better and another question is that us and patriotism patriotism for both sides utalindwa for the fans and patriotism for the players, we saw many fans of Tanzania we the fans we want the success of the year that is today tulete Coach tomorrow to take the championship hakiwezekani something that is very difficult to see the fans see it today they get good results wanalazimisha elected aondoke what is needed is that that and patriotism tukubali that tuumie for several years but at the end of the day that we can get better team team that itakuja did well in the coming years but tukitaka success for a short period of time will be able to reach second fans and supporters anaingia at the type Msome his team player to use him that player Tanzania Tanzania already more that old to buy time hanipendi desert fans
< unk > as Sadik wanaipenda their team and wakakubali to be patient and'll do it better in Santa games
