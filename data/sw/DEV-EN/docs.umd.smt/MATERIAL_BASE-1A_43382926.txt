Acts of theft, robbery vimezidi Mbagala Abdul Fumba, Mbagala car Toyota Noah likinyanyuliwa and a special vehicle, after knock houses in the area of Tabata damp Dar es Salaam the day before yesterday, as a result of road vifusi vilivyomwagwa without be distributed.
Picture by Salim Shao an editor, I this plea for the police force lichukue quick action because we the residents of Mbagala, Temeke district, it is now common to hear zinalia bullets.
Although it is difficult to know yanakotokea those incidents, but we have witnessed several people wakivamiwa, stolen phones and injured shot dead.
I nahisi there are shipments of weapons that zinamilikiwa and people or groups and used in these events.
Example two weeks ago people who hawakufahamika walisikika wakirusha shot seven times.
Heading to these people came from the area of Chamazi and sounds showed that they were threatening people walking on the road and in time there were shot, they are air, maybe so wasiwafuatilie or wasijitokeze wanayopita areas.
I think if the police do a search in collaboration with a citizen can kuzikamata those weapons because these people hawaishi heaven but from here is in the world.
