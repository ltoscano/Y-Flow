Was umekithiri
For now
The real situation the access to drugs seme subiri is equivalent to fifty percent and three
Because the important drugs between one hundred and thirty five store there are no drugs vinavyohitajika seventy-one of those drugs and others are at the centers
The state of the availability of drugs itaimarika more oktoba month this year
Now because
And oceans of drug use long-term contracts
And washitiri meaning framework contract
So as to improve the availability of drugs quickly
Zinapohitajika according to zinapopatikana money
And as well as we would like to insist
That ehhe masimbi ready nimeshapokea approximately twenty billion shillings
Which will help to ensure that we continue to have these drugs like where I have talked previously
Now that is the minister or the secretary in the Ministry of Health dokta Mpoki Ulisubisya right
Speaking about the issue and how the government of President John Magufuli alcohol
Inavyolishughulikia and last year ocean of drugs in Tanzania, popularly known as this Hemed
It was reported by various agencies akitishia stopping the delivery of medication
Which is important for health institutions of government debt until when the ninety billion shillings ingelipwa and institutions but the spokesperson of the ocean drugs in that country Etty Kusiluka
Holding that despite the complaints of lack of medicine bukhari has enough medicine Etty Kusiluka let tuambie now this lack in some hospital stations kuzungumziwa unasababishwa and what is going on
Fuchs hospital of lack of drugs is not because there are no drugs drugs
The pharmaceutical drugs there are drugs have started to enter session and medicine health centers ukishaanza kutomba video
And how long will take to reach all hospitals and that require collective institutions
Work four hours three two to buy medicine for preserving and distributing hosi tunaposambaza medicine due to alivyopigia applications which is medicine
Getting requests all hospital which has caused the request
Zinafanyiwa drugs that are being circulated and taken to the procedure to those
We have been rumors that if one year where these ilopita stated that those who have not paid, maybe they have of
Which were the money
Healthcare are supposed to pay the fact that reports that the drugs, there are those who is being waited work is to ensure a citizen of Tanzania receives treatment and that is why unasikia even those who do not have the weapons they were given drugs to exercise and taking drugs
Continues, as usual other issues of our nimekosea paying debts they're communication
