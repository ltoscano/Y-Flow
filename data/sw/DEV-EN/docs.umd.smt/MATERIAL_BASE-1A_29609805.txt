The CCM viwekewe infrastructure Editor best several week ago I heard the Minister of Information, Nape Nnauye saying the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) has the responsibility to sit and stakeholders including the owners of plots, mechanisms of putting modern equipment at used in the premier league games so that it can be easy to serve wanapopatwa players and the problems in the field.
Nape gave the advice in Mwanza, during the preparations of the special game, organized for the purpose of the family player kuichangia Ismail Halfan liyepoteza life in the attack in the heart at the end of last year.
, advice editor, Minister Nape is beneficial but it is good for the Revolutionary Party angeuelekeza who is the owners of many grounds used in the premier league.
CCM is the plot owners as CCM Kirumba, Sokoine, Majimaji, Republic Sijaona, Morogoro and Dodoma and Samora.
As the owner of the grounds CCM has the responsibility of putting the important services guidelines for players.
Mwanzagi Chunya, Msambweni.
