After Tanzania lost 7 without and Algeria.. Shaffih Dauda Aichana badly TFF, adai were doing the efforts Uongo Kuhadaa Wa Tanzania

From The Desk of Shaffih Dauda: One of the big problems we Tanzanians is kutokukubali where there is someone amekuzidi.
Many times usually tunadharau that is what, for example a person has a good gali watasema that kahongwa or kaiba.
Accept reality or the success of someone so as to give potential challenges like sikufikia or kukaribia aliyekutangulia's success.

It means that those efforts uhongo zilizokua zifanywa and TFF kuwaaminisha Tanzanians that we can beat Algeria is something that the lies completely.
That is why I from the beginning nilikua napinga for more than 100 percent about the issue, scoring against Algeria.
That is why since the beginning nilitoa the promise that if Algeria provided by Tanzania nitaenda then in prison, I have loved to civilian life that is why nilikua and that the real issue could not be possible.

The ball has no Short cut is plans that is clear, TFF played and psychology of people after they failed to their basic work to manage the investment of soccer.
Algeria wakaunda Waliwadharau committee, which was a way of kuwaada and kuwaaminisha Tanzanians that is possible easily scoring Algeria.

Sifurahii the results but on the other side nafurahia.
This be a lesson to the leaders who have the mentality kishabiki instead of management and forming the stable foundation to remain our soccer, to lure them propaganda of Tanzanians.
