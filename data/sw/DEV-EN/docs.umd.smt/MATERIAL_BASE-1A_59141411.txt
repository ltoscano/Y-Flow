You find someone complaints very difficult conditions, although he doesn't anajitahidi zinazoonekana that efforts to deal with the situation.
By wanaomfahamu for a long time they know is that its procedure begging.
This is a nuisance, because it is a habit inayopunguza love uliokuwapo between family or a friend for a long time.
This is the time for everyone to work with dedication to yaende things people otherwise watatafutiana blame and private primary reasons.
Everyone he knows that the state needs to help imebana and when when there is need and not someone anaitumia as capital of not doing anything to be is requesting from his brothers and relatives.
