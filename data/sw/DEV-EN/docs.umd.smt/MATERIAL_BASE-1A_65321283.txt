The government has a great potential namuunga killings supported the Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa that religious leaders wakemee murder because our country matukioa has entered into the murder, which in the previous years hayakuwahi happened.
We have witnessed the killing of people slaughtered like Mwanza, Tanga and Kigamboni (Dar es Salaam).
These events hayakuandamana and theft of property but indicates is hatred.
If today's human ataacha freely take hand law inapozuka hatred between them, these killings yatapungua.
Together with that, Majaliwa nakuomba uelewe that the government has a big opportunity to deal with because it has these organs like the police and the army.
There are people who are misikitini and churches, but hawawasikilizi their leaders because they have their stands.
How these even wakionywa, still can implement their hatred.
Isitoshe there are others hawaendi church or MSIKITINI.
So the government step to tackling this.
God A, Arusha
