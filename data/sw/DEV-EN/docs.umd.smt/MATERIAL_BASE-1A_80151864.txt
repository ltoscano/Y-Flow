Women Ghasia your case.
These members seem to be like they don't have a plan to discuss what is going on mjengoni, but they have their things.
Is my thoughts only.
Because most of the time seem to be to discuss matters concerning the elections and how to the campaign and win.
Let me niwataje even if he is Professor of what our things.... because their style of the campaign and as such is their luck deputy speaker hajawagundua campaign that they only viewing them, must ashuke them.
Is Hawa Ghasia, Peter Serukamba and Stephen Ngonyani (Maji Marefu), why the other day sat for a long time a lot at the corner mjengo I think were wanapanga a way to start the game.
All these members wanagombea the position of the message of the national executive committee of Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) through the 10 members of the group.
However, apart from look like wanaunganisha strength to taking the campaign, their colleague, Livingston Lusinde seems to be with incredible speed in his campaign kivyakevyake is doing.
