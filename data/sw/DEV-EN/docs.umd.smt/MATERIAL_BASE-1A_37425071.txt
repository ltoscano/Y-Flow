We as the head of the district as their fellow youth there is something kukuambia
That is even grateful for grateful and not to compete with the uliyonayo responsibilities
I thank you first thirty have been part of the very important of educating the community but well vinawasaidia citizens to know that various things that their country is doing and the truth I correct mid-fielder between the citizens and their government as has made
And and and and and and in something like the ulilolisema
Nitaimalizia but only tell the Kinondoni
Through the you

Usually has a new mahakimu
In the district courts
I have decided to remove all those who were present because of complaints from citizens
Peace and one case six hundred
And the ability to solve the case because of that case forty
Therefore tunajikuta tunabeba has one case five hundred sixty
And my area the size of the Kinondoni five hundred square kilometers for every one
And one million people and six hundred thousand
Because mi I have many people than arusha province one hundred thousand people who have one million six hundred and eighty seven
During arusha tunaingia solution

Therefore my meaning Kinondoni saying that has been and land conflicts because of the numbers of people
And the truth and akiniambia is good because will look for parliamentary votes which tunaenda kuwapigia they would like to have the house
