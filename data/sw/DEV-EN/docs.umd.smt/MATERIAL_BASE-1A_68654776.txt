Thank you very much sir ulikiri house beach as you picture Masele private we ehhe umeshiriki with the army America has made various activities go let our side is that these ehhe the army will be commemorated as that day today what soldiers you you remember what and anakula important for soldiers and their families through the phone like today
Ehhe in on a day like today
Faces they know Shomari is many times we remember the fight that main waliotutangulia fought and won
There is a struggle as has happened to the coastal ujima
During the world war
Ehhe there are great struggle as the fight occurred < hes > in Vietnam
So many times and the commission not recall very people who walikufa in which the great struggle hatukuweza although walikufa but won the laboratory that ukija
Ako true thank you very much for explaining yalivyo things but there is something that many also asking even on the internet wamekua unauliza that soldiers who are accused wahi serving here in America, there are certain things that sponsors as the normal people, maybe maybe at the restaurants for transportation, maybe maybe in what are the things that get waliwahi soldiers serving as a profit to the government and sadly
Ehhe
Tumambo there are a lot of things but I will talk about the few things
AHH only for example and who span a union of our call it and what we need to do trying to think word of a fine
Bank liwekama
Of the people who have retired from the army
Many times ohh for us who Election Commission commission and we have been members of the army tukienda asked for loans for example, if you want to buy houses I want to buy a car is very easy for us we get loans when tukienda than usual in the bank
Okay there inaeleweka inaeleweka very well and as well as Sunday, I see that while on a day like today inapoingilia that there are other things and there are restaurants and Mikahawa here in America, which makes food for those soldiers were able to last, and it is like not unaijua that there are things the two sidhani a dokta re lovins Peoples a place you sometimes course you course for meat, therefore soldiers there are business people and restaurants which Medics is grateful for the way the army were able to provide food to last in the army in America and as well as the picture Masele you can kutueleza on the other side, where there are different challenges which soldiers ehhe you mnazipitia especially in the training to do your work meaning that something you can ukajiuliza inakumbana and journalists who ehhe every time there are maybe unazozifahamu challenges
< hes > there are many challenges but
I would nitaeleza briefly
The first challenge
< hes > is the working hours
Many people who are still in the offices for eight hours, it becomes home
But also in the army tunapokuwa
Especially is being outside the country can ukafanya work until for twenty four hours is the pumzika
Therefore it is very common
Another challenge mnapokuwa umeshiriki in various struggle and has witnessed many casualties and deaths
Are people who are enemies side wenzako soldiers and soldiers
There are other people farmers are are about AHH you can't know what there is kuenda well those events his results here when they return home are if they have mental problems
Due to witnessed things to say the truth and the truth
