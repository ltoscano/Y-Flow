Ummy Mwalimu and advice to men Dodoma.
Enyi men sikilizeni now good advice from the minister of health, community development, gender, the elderly and children, Ummy Mwalimu.
As hukumsikia Ummy is that hajapiga banned men to walk or that and of his romantic relationship with women.
Okay, let me nikujuze what happened when in parliament and especially speech from kinywani for this leader about the love.
Is this, "msitembee male and female children studying and instead mkihitaji those things from the streets go many" are women.
I don't know if the local women will agree with the statement this, because it's like anawasakizia by the wild dog with hunger.
But on the second side some of the women they can see something the best of luck to them, why students them now wamepigwa "" stop.
Neighborhoods?
Wanapatikanaje?
And they will be and what introduction to what time?
This is not my thoughts, is when I go mjengoni nikupeleke ukamuulize akupe answers.
