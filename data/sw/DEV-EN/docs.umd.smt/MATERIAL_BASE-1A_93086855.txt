The month of March not usual to see such floods until majumba collapse and people lost their lives.
These are the yaliyoikumba of climate change in the whole world as a result of the environmental pollution.
In order to understand that these changes is well to check his deep, source, its mustakbali and zinazofaa action be taken.
Tusiishie just think our road of Dar es Salaam or flood our house collapse.

Peter Werner, who is an expert in the weather at the Potsdam Institute of its examination of the meteorological authorities, he says: "Tunapochunguza weather conditions in the world, like the quantity of rain that is not normal, floods, drought, storm, and to see his changes, we can say for sure that those situation normal non-zimeongezeka four times in the past 50 years".
He says these changes yamesababishwa and the increase in the air like a certain gas mvuke, carbon emission, nitrasi oksaidi, and methane.
Ameharibu, a system of the origin.
It is because for a long time the industries and vehicles yamechafua air to billions of tons of causing the increase of gas summer.
Scientists that fear that the increase in the number of those gas limezuia lisitoke extra the heat of the world.
So, those gas zinanasa extra the heat of the air in the world like the mirror in front of the vehicle kinavyonasa heat linaloingia inside the vehicle.
