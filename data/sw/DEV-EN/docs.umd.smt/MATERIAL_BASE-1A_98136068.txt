Parents to fight in front of the children is misconduct Ingawa every the community has its culture, I believe in every community, there is no parents seeing ufahari quarreled and even reach exchanged Makonde in front of their children.
Even if the parents have not anger how ustaarabu start kuvutana clothes while mkitoa severe words in front of young children.
It is possible today msione that is a big problem, but any child who ameishi witnessing wakipigana parents get affected by the growth of a certain way in his child.
A bad thing is that more hufika when even the children with their marriage hujikuta feel to fight is a culture of normal, because their mother wameishi see it anapigwa and closed out of the house or jikoni.
These actions also vimefanya some of the girls kuwachukia their father and watching out are people who do not have mercy.
