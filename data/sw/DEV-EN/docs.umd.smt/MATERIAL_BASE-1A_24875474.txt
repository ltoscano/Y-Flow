Waholanzi and bicycle culture, we tunakimbilia private cars in the future we competing to go to work with the vehicles of bad prices, our colleagues at work and have the bicycle.
Here is Ede, Holland.
The popular bicycle transport.
This issue is not common.
Imagine, a student of the first year University Professor do not fully explain his bicycle apande, to go to college.
Certainly is something unaloweza kuliewa in Dar es Salaam.

In these circumstances where everyone anatafsiri development by looking at things, and in the environment that everyone is ready to be seen and is even ikibidi on loan, almuradi aendeshe a car, it is difficult to get solutions to the problems of the permanent '' congestion in Dar es Salaam.
Everyone thinks solve this problem by increasing the road car.

Let fikiri as wangeamua people using public transport, this, this current yangeondoka mangapi vehicles on the road?
Another hour, inachekesha.
40 vehicles on the street it yanayohangaika Ubongo yamebeba passengers can be between 40-42!
Every vehicle, one person!
At all those akiamua bicycle planting or using public transport, the queues will continue to be right?

Other problems are only view.
Progress is more than owning a car.
