The referees of the First Division League wamulikwe them an editor there and the referees hekaheka kuwafungia wanaochezesha Premier League matches.
The truth is that there is every reason to follow even the bridges matches under that there are things are happening you cannot kudhania.
I think there is every reason to start to follow up on these referees.
First Division League is the team that gives the Premier League, his results zinapanda team for bad uchezeshaji and zikija while visitors are the occasion, this problem of referees isitazamwe in only the Premier League, even the lower levels.
I believe TFF and the managers of the league will be keen on this ninalolisema and bring changes to the uchezeshaji.
