Wajadi peers Simba yanga and one meet anapofungua why we must atafutwe mchawi mi I would say one thing first, I would say that there is in politics
For us here in Tanzania matches.
We believe that match tunazungumzia Tanzania tukizungumzia Simba and yanga is a team that is not for me is we believe that it is the team that building even the national team but comes hours ajisikiavyo comes in the whole issue that everyone is fanaticism that
We utakapo muacha certain player dream utakapoisha namchukua mi so nimtumie kukukomesha you and political issues sikuzote ukizungumzia sikuzote hainaga or political
All day these even men are kuchafuana
AHH, there is another issue as registration
Registration is taking place between Simba and yanga if you check the players and yanga Simba
Many times ukikuta anatubu players player Simba dating anaingia yanga plays for yanga wakichoka anarudi yanga Simba ones but we do that because I have a problem
Kijicho yatafutwa that you ulitoka ownership has brought a certain team has come
And troops
There is no anything else which am talking about living with the fans of nikizungumzia
Teams like unazungumzia team supporters access those players on the pitch those two twenty walinipeleka until wanawakilisha or team team but even if the team is fans who wanaishabikia that you know completely mi is), Simba of Simba and many are we are there, it shows that is how they have to have the strength to Simba nijishikiliange wananguvu ukizungumzia public
We are the fans team
But the team opinions ten people who are one and two on the pitch those are people wanawakilisha those fans there is another issue that can talk about
Limited a ideas for players
Do so linakujaje because if you look at it, for example if Mrisho Ngassa she went Tanzania akaenda Tottenham
Going to check but what happened after returned to make preparations to ARUDI should have the strength he alivyorudi returned
That whatsoever that he cannot presence kutokujiamini ajiamini that can't be able to do something with them but using hakupo and believe in themselves
These are some of the things that are doing that that mchawi atafutwe
How much the situation only to that saying that I am mi Simba Simba I move ninaenda yanga but there are players who if you check in
Other teams like the army Kitila sim card they have good players more than but that their ability and the faith that these are the players is the reason setting or we continue tunadhani
