Reasons for children to make sure you can as capital
If you check the system of male system that is underway at the moment in various parts of the moment an example Tanzania Masai watume people are female children is the capital
Stomach whenever he only have set beba pregnant mmmmm then a man can give a'ombe for a parent of a woman in a parent a child atakayezaliwa after the birth of a woman is usually ready ameshaolewa
That the father who ameshaoa amchukue a girl will be a small after'ombe vijisenti abroad
Five and ten anaolewa girl or the bad, and after anazaa child has been and cannot ilimu because already is the wife of someone conor uonekane poverty is the source of this woman kutokufanya what he did as a female child afikirie issues because wamefanywa that business capital
To me I think bigger here so that we can maybe tuiweke equivalent to kuelewana tuchukue poverty points only because of that because keen unapoingia in in the family but when you have in the family hauchagui a baby boy
A female child but I think that the biggest here, maybe to help their colleagues
Saba to help Grace and wila here is the biggest systems because of that
Our family many
You find for Tanzanian youth
If someone analelewa in the family anafikisha thirty years old but is still dependent within the family as a result of which tunakuwa tumejiwekea systems
Haituandai conducive environment for young people to prepare to be independent in the economy which
Begins consciousness because of that the age of eight and ten years
Who anatambuliwa and our constitution in terms of a young boy haumuandai at the family level to prepare independent itself as he and that is the biggest problem but the second
There are the problems of the system like
Of the traditional these traditional problems that there are other people are using traditional laws if those ulizosema of selling unborn child
But tuchukulie point of poverty as poverty is the criterion that made a young asifikie female goals because wanayoweza
That discovered poverty there in his capacity as he doing akiwajibika efforts can that told me to sometimes tulichukulie I don't know the week because if we continue to complain poverty poverty, the responsibility of poverty even if you know that a big percentage
A young wasilichukulie should tukombolewe cannot
Until until you empowerment
During inaonewa wakiamua can
You can if we male children
True you know
Nichukulie tukapita that he didn't have a female child I can I can I cannot Swahili
Time brutality
Of maybe kinachofanya of youth of many female wasikie development
To achieve their goals are different kukiangalia and male youths in our family of many kiafrica a female child is the wanakofanyia is working a lot of home for example is sa home all its students are now going to school but leaving after the girl daughter studies utamkuta wafanyikazi but he is a must and being a youth umekwenda studying together with his friend maybe even going in additional studies, but the girl daughter anabaki home you at the end of the day akija doing the exams
Alivyovisema things are very few compared but aliotumia time to read and a girl who is the daughter of female given female read
A young boy becomes has used a lot of time must atasikia his goals but female daughter becomes if it is an obstacle to him even achieve his goals also
But I think that like I think they said that there is a lot of work akijipakulia
In his work
Becomes a person of learning is a young boy can akaruhusiwa from the day they can get home to his fellow youths to study but also last ten o'clock number one and two ten o'clock and usually home huoni that the young boy amejenga favorable environment to achieve his goals than bin
And where if you check again on the side even where education
Najitolea example mi himself kitamfanya we can reach here is the mental ability that little who is capable of giving column and
That is caused by my parent a boy not a girl a boy because I know they will be news to Kitchen or to do many other things which the lower yatakusaidia
You to do good joy is the mother to the home, there is no need to study I believe sa that wasemavyo young people in relation to our topic which was says
What kinachangia female youth
Asifikie his goals and so here
