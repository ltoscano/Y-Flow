MTEMBEA freely fair and free coal because in his walking may akaokota.
In that context, that are also husema mgaagaa and upwa wali situation mkavu.

These sayings zinamaanisha that who many times hujipatia different livelihood and a person who hajishughulishi.
As a parent, this week imenipendeza giving our youth mawaidha tunapoanza this year which can help them in front of the journey.
This column imeshawahi writing about the misconceptions inayojengeka to some of the youths during the studies at various levels of education that they are studying for the purpose of their parents or guardians and others it boycott the step to go to school like to read to them is for the benefit of the parents or guardians.
The truth is that unasoma for the purpose of your life himself and your family utakayoianzisha and not otherwise.
Following can give you light on those things.
It was at the evening, in one of the areas to rest at the end of the week in the city of Dar es Salaam nilipopata got stuck this story.
Mesmerized by an account that he had ananipatia my neighbor niliyekuwa nabadilishana and ideas from neighboring countries of Kenya.
Alisimulia that two parents who work and live in a good house in Nairobi, found themselves having to take a step that feed hawakuitarajia after their son for every state until the age of 35 years while still under their empire.
According to the thoughtful, at the time of his life, the young that was all services to parents and he every akiambiwa information on claims that refuses to acknowledge that a certain work is not good.
The father someone he enjoys the situation but because alimpenda his youth and because the ability of money uliruhusu became hachukui any action.
Finally kija alioa at the age of 35 years and therefore his parents kumhamishia at a house to stay in the home.
The new, they get the first child, then second and later wakajaaliwa while all three of their time and their children getting all services of living from their parents amount of getting even the vehicle for the purpose of their travel private and their families.
Here I would like to remind of popular a saying also usemeo; "mleavyo is the Child" "akuavyo.
The youth that when he continues to expand his family with his parents still live in a big house, akamwomba father that it is good he fail a house with his parents, because they are only two Waishi small houses, then the worker.
According to the msimulizi what, that is when his father alipogutuka and to take action.
He is planning to pay for his house of her child for six months and kumwahidi that in that period ataikarabati big houses, houses losing a servant and then the day at those houses to live.
For the boy accepted harakaharaka like what his elder.
In that period the father akalazimika to reduce the use for her child and kumfungulia asiendelee business, so as to be dependent on everything.
Before a period of six months ended, the father akauza his house and moving to other places without his youth to know.
During penalty came to return to their houses alimkuta with another house midomo and remained open.
The efforts of repeating his father told him that he does not even money for paying ziligonga rock house after being told to is his responsibility safeguarding his family and not otherwise.
Yaliyofuata is cry and grinding teeth to darkness, get in touch with the life.
An account this is enough investment to example youths who due to the authority of the power of their parents hujikuta like them have power and rankings.
There are children of the directors, heads of the provinces and districts and even popular traders who hujiona that kujishughulisha need to search for their lives just because hujiona them that they have power and these assets just like their parents.
Think that have no need kujisumbua looking for their property.
This is misconceptions and young people have no choice but to change.
This is possible tuache kubweteka and your property which is not.
Your search wahenga "Mtegemea say because of his brother hufa" poor.
