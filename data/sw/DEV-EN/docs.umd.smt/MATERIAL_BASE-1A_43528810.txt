I'm from the streets channel plays the voice of America-voa Washington d _ c almost radio and through our player in lasting in another time where we look here that the phone in detail tujaribu analyzing more and get more information and the expansion of every than usual mi Sunday Shomari hands in my colleague mkamiti kibayasi and on the side of the phone lines we will and jijikuishi Mkuranga from Kenya and our reporter kennedy wandera from
In detail today tunaanza directly and report the report of the human rights human Rights Watch the accident therefore indicates that the operation walipotea hawajulikani but they have a period of two years ago while in the hands of the troops to deal with terrorism in Kenya army forces tumewakamata almost thirty eight people and ulihusishwa and the terror group of Al-Shabaab
But there is no anyone among these alifunguliwa charges
With family members say they do not know the state they are or their brothers arrested kufananishwa waanza kufahamishwa and these security agencies or their brothers of getting in and despite reports that those waliopotea were in the hands of the army officers
That period also ten bodies and one of the people who were arrested while mahari and government departments zilipatikana
And added more fear to those who walilitenda that now they are considered food information according to the human rights
Now, then talk about more in detail tumejaribu looking for him, the coordinator of the national commission for defending human rights in Kenya
Likewise Mister George Bush laura and George Mrara led wanting to know how kitakuja first which are areas that these people wanapotea kiholela in Kenya and maybe mkamiti such talk before that George morara that is assistant chairman in the commission of human rights in Kenya which is the know him in phone lines you Sunday me
Thank you very much time mkamiti soon
AHH, the truth is that we as the commission of defending human rights in Kenya those reports tunazo
And
This is due to the
The research that we as tulifanya commission last year where tuliangalia AHH battle kiholela disappearing people in Kenya
Natukae andika the report which called for the English < unk > hero fighting huchelewa policies
And in the report tulijumuisha battle
Mmhm people more than eighty one and the main hatujui eating kuotea they do not know they are until now
And also more than twenty people who lost their lives in the AHH call Exhibition tomorrow or the killing of kiholela
And therefore the case presented maybe is what to especially that can be implemented at the moment is maybe what measures to take nyinyi which you and maybe you know they were involved
For now, a step that we have purposely taken because we if we have a commission of partnership
AHH very close to one where tunaiita is the council of the issues of police or
Police oversight of Authority
Ohh tulizopata news tuliweza partnering with this council tukawapa these reports about a visa
And people take a step that will do more to ensure that if there is a police who walihusika wamechukuliwa legal action
The second issue which tumelifanya is that the inspector general of police committee met and
< hes > saying the head coach of the police and tukajadili
AHH events of our research
Tukodishe that there are some of the Kenyans who say that their families their community imetoweka
And tukayatimiza there are
AHH need the police to be on the front line to ensure that they are doing the research or when they are doing to ensure that those who < hes > wamekuleta commission report in
AHH zinadhibitisha in accordance with the law that is in Kenya
