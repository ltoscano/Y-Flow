President John Magufuli has disclosed the secret of his step of disappointing the board of directors of the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA).

He has said that he was forced to take that step after the board approve 26 billion shillings to be taken to a special account in several business banks.
That board gave permission to be taken to those funds in those banks while there is a directive by the president of banning public institutions, public organizations, government departments, agents and ministries to put their money to commercial banks.
Those funds are supposed to be opened in the Tanzania Central Bank (BoT).
Last Sunday in the morning, the State House announced that Doctor Magufuli broke the board of directors of TRA, and a few hours he appointed the deputy commissioner general.
The State House without explaining the reason, it said that President Magufuli has dismissed the appointment of the chairman of the board of directors of TRA, Bernard Mchomvu, and taking it to the whole board.
Moreover, in addition to taking that board, he appointed Charles Lugere to be the deputy commissioner general of TRA, to fill the position that was open for one year after Doctor Magufuli to revoke the appointment of the former president of that position, Lusekelo Mwaseba.
"The appointment of another chairman of the board of directors of TRA and the board of that authority will be announced later," explained the State House statement released on Sunday morning.
According to the report of this year of TRA, members of the board that were appointed in the year 2014 and were asked to serve until the year 2017 and the areas that were working when they were appointed in brackets is Shogholo Msangi (assistant commissioner of policy, Ministry of Finance), Khamis Omari (secretary general, Ministry of Finance, Zanzibar) and Doctor Philip Mpango (as the secretary general of the commission of planning).
For now, Doctor Mpango is the Minister of Finance and Planning.
Others are Professor Beno Ndullu (the Governor of the Central Bank of Tanzania (BoT), Assaa Ahmad Rashid (secretary of the Ministry of Constitution and Law Zanzibar), Josephat Kege (member of parliament Kalambo - Rukwa), Doctor John Mduma (senior lecturer, department of economic research and policy at the University of Dar es Salaam - UDA), Doctor Nsubso Isaga, (lecturer of Mzumbe University), and Rished Bade (with the Commissioner General TRA).
The secretary of that board was Juma Bannon (TRA).
Bade suffered from that position.
While addressing yesterday at the 31 graduation of the University of Huria Tanzania (OUT) at the headquarters of the university, Bungo, Kibaha district in the Coastal Province, Doctor Magufuli said that he had traits the board as a result of violating the procedures.
He explained that their action to approve those funds to be put in different banks, is different from the instructions since that was the game done by institutions and organizations.
"Now I don't know if the University of Huria and you have been putting the progress of development in Fixed Deposit Account, (a special account) but that's been the game, the day before yesterday we have found funds a total of 26 billion shillings that were given by the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) for the use of TRA, were taken to three banks like Fixed Deposit Account and the TRA Board has passed, that is why I received the information, money I took by the board by happy.
"Even at the moment the minister (education, Professor Joyce Ndalichako) is here, the Tanzania Education Authority (TEA), which was established for special reasons, is allocated money when there are their money they have imported the Fixed Deposit Account, that minister is a message sent and Delivered," insisted President Magufuli.
He said that there has been a game of heads of different institutions to take money and put them on a special account where the government goes to borrow at a high cost.
"For now, this is the game that is played and causing the government to lack money, an issue that the government is not ready to see the misuse of its funds," explained Doctor Magufuli who is known for insisting to restrict government expenditure and are disgusted with the violation of government operations.
He said this game has been giving the government a high cost because of borrowing money in the bank at a high cost and misleading the availability of revenue.
"I request that you will continue removing them because the country reaches a place in trouble where they can hold sessions even in Europe and due to this trauma, it has increased from 1.2 trillion and to 1.8 trillion where the economy has improved," explained Doctor Magufuli.
He said the economy has improved and you are supposed to take by 7.2 percent, but until the quarter of this year has grown by 7.9 percent and that one of the countries whose economy is growing rapidly, which among five countries has been the second after Ivory Coast.
In addition, he said that the value of money has risen and that the ones that are talking about money is those who are sharing a deal that for now they don't have a chance.
