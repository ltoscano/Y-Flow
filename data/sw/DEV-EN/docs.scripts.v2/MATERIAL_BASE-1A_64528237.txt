"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
There is a time I had to say through one of my newspaper in this newspaper that, so as to be a leader in the Simba and Yanga clubs, you need to have certain behaviors.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
I see some of those behaviors such as a whip and a person to give numerous promises when you want to contest for various positions, even if you see that there is no friendly environment for enable you to implement those promises.
But it should also be a person to withstand conflicts and violence in the country and there from the members of those clubs.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
This situation was there in those old clubs, there is now and will continue to be there if the whole system of leading Simba and Yanga will not change.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
The big problem in these clubs is leaning towards the decision that has often been done by members, or through the sessions and official meetings or informal meetings.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
There is a time it seems that some of the members of these clubs are there for their interests and not for the interests of those clubs.
For example, it has been a group of groups in these clubs whose days come up during conflicts and not during the development plans.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
This system of these clubs who have been nominated, there is a possibility of taking them to the clubs more than here in the country.
History shows that Simba and Yanga clubs have been blamed for a long time in the premier league and to show jokes that has caused those teams to have many lovers.

"But I'm not Going to do it.
There is no foundation that took place on the side of investment in the soccer of this country more than different leaders who have been getting into power to have ghost plans.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Perhaps this may be allocated by some of the members of those clubs with ideas of looking closely and not far.
The majority of these clubs are raising regular disputes from members to the leadership.

At the end of the week there were reports of the former secretary general of Yanga, Beno Njovu to release the level, but more reports say that he has finished his term, according to the contract he had with that club.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
There is no one who refused that Njovu has not finished his term, but the way he used to release the stairs for the announcement through the media is the ones that they were in.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Njovu, who came to power in January this year, taking the position of Lawrence Mwalukasa, has been leaving office in that style that he received Mwalukasa.
For Now accounts, Yanga has made changes to three secretaries within 15 months.

"But I'm not Going to do it.
Before Mwalukasa was there, Celestine Mwesigwa, who is currently the secretary general of Tanzania Football Federation (TFF).
Yanga has also ever brought the secretary general from Kenya, Patrick Nagi, the elders of Yanga accused him because he is not a member of Yanga.

We are back there that some members have a decision without knowing what it means.
They have forgotten that that is an opportunity to be employed and neither the position of members to vote as they do with the chairman and other leaders.

"But I'm not Going to do it.
The secretary is a key leader in any institution.
He is a leader who is supposed to be responsible in broad in his institution.
This means that he is responsible for a long-term plans and for a short time.
As I had previously said previously, which has ruled the ball in our big club are members who sometimes fail to recognize their positions.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
At the same time, the secretaries were elected, they were sitting in power for a long time.
And after the secretary came to power he was trying to create a certain group that if there will be any problem to be ready to defend him.

"But I'm not Going to do it.
These days have changed after those positions are being announced and people are employed by their professional qualifications.
There are several things to consider for at least the secretaries who are employed in these clubs to be able to sit for a long time so as to implement the plans they made for the sake of development.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
What is seen for now the position of the secretary for Simba club and Yanga is as the registration of a player.
It means that the leadership can build a difficult environment due to personal reasons he hate his employment and he decided to release his level.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
As it is for some of the leaders to intervene in the office of their coaches in various decisions including registration, that is how it is for the leaders to interfere with the responsibilities of their secretaries.
The current secretaries for our old clubs have turned out to be the departments, because of the leadership of the club wanting to do everything.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
In this ongoing situation in the Yanga club to change the secretaries, it is a must for members and leaders to look at afresh while knowing that the problem is in that club.
If not to the members is for leadership.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
There is a certain disorder to some people wanting what they are saying without being opposed.
But for the position of the secretary general, he is supposed to be given a chance to do his work without interference without the basic reasons.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Perhaps Yanga were supposed to be hopeful for depending on this style of making a look for depend on "Sterling one, and they are continuing to build themselves by making their plans to end up in the words and papers, to benefit a few clever.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Without changing in this, things will be those that are inside Yanga club.
His translations may be as a dictatorship.
Or is it saying that Yanga have not got the secretary that suit them until now that is why they have been employed every after a short time?
