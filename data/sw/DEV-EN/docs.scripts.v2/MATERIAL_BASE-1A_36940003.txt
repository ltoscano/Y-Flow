That advice resulted from the continued presence of parents who refuse to educate their female children so as to remove them and get livestock.
Kahundi said in the current world education is everything in giving birth to a child, therefore it is good for parents in Shinyanga province to change their negative attitude and focus on education to their children who will be able to help in life later.
"If you put an end to the child is the same as saving your life later when you click it and to give us strength to work, because he is the one who will come to make it into your guardian and he will bring him well with education," he said.
In addition, he added that it is good for now parents in the province to stop appreciating the livestock than a person's personality, but to get education and educate their children so that later they will be the fruits of education and having better life and eradicate poverty.
The chairman of the board of that school, Peter Kuguru, urged parents to build a culture of monitoring the development of their children in school and to prevent them from all the needs, so as to avoid them from the ds that they have been making their dreams.
