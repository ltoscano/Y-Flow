The newspaper in yesterday's edition had a story with the headline that "eating foods that do not affect many."

According to the news, for now many residents of big cities in the country like Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Tanga, Mwanza and Mbeya, are facing non-infectious diseases easily because of the use of food and drinks that do not consider better nutrition.
Also, the news explained that the lack of food that is not nutrition, causes various diseases such as diabetes.
The problem of consumption and excessive consumption is largely in major Cities due to the Disease of Food and drinks, and also lack of time and areas to do exercises.
We support the statement of health professionals, including non-communicable diseases, that there is a large number of people with those diseases, but they don't know if they are being sent.
One of the specialist doctors, Doctor Rose Hyness, says the investigation that was done by the institution that deals with non-communicable diseases in the country, has shown that in Arusha province, 30 percent of adults, are faced with diabetes, which are caused by not doing exercises.
Furthermore, we support the statement released recently by the adviser of health issues in the country, Doctor Ali Mzige that the current system of life, affects and destroyed many human beings.
Doctor Mzige mentions several issues of doing so as to improve health and avoid various diseases that are not necessary to include leaving smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol.
According to Doctor Mzige, smoking of cigarettes are in a big possibility of getting more than 40 diseases, which are dangerous to their health, such as ugly, cancer, tuberculosis, heart, oral and eyes as well as hair-dropping, while drinking alcohol causes 60 diseases such as the liver and reducing 4 CD for AIDS patients.
We are fulfilling the health testing activities to continue in all provinces in the country, because many people are patients, but they don't know and they don't want the hospital to be treated until they are overwhelmed; a situation that is causing sometimes to lose life.
It is clear that many people, especially low-income earners, do not have time to test their health due to the focus of life.
Many of them feel a mild, hample drugs or buying drugs in drug shops without testing.
When they are overwhelmed, they may be in the hospital and were found with serious problems, thus it is difficult to be treated.
We ask the government to continue to enable the citizens to test their health; and if possible it will build a special day of testing the health, as it reaches the day of cleaning that is every end of the month; and a day of planting trees nationally.
We insist that the major methods of dealing with various diseases must be reversed and exercising their body daily.
We do exercises without limits.
