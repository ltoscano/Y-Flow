That bank is alleged to give a bribe of 6 million American dollars (12 billion shillings) as bribery to government officials so that it can get that business in the country.
Prime Minister Majaliwa while speaking to this newspaper recently, he said that the government will work on the opinions of various stakeholders including members of parliament who are advised to be sentenced to that bank due to the scandal.
"We as the government we will work and where we have arrived at a step of giving information to the public concerning the implementation of that advice, we will do that," said the Prime Minister.
Speaking to this newspaper the day before yesterday, the executive director of the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), Commissioner Valentino Mlowola said the institution is continuing with that investigation that is in the last stages in collaboration with different media stations and outside the country.
That director said that the investigation will be completed recently, the government will be in a good position to decide about that bank being sentenced or not charged with that issue.
"At any time the investigation will end and therefore, the issue will be resolved and the official report will be provided to the citizens so that they know the fate of their money that were taken as valid on this issue," said Mlowola.

The loan with interest that will be able to climb started to be paid in March this year and it will be paid until the year 2020 for the 9 passes.
By the year 2020, Tanzania will pay that debt together with a total of 897 million American dollars (almost 2 trillion shillings), however, various stakeholders including members of parliament claim that the loan is caused by corruption while the bank was alleged to give a bribe of 6 million American dollars (12 billion shillings) as bribery to government officials so that it can get that business.
After the emergence of that scandal, PCCB used the report of the Institute of Investigation of England (SFO) in taking appropriate measures against those who are mentioned in that scandal.
However, it is reported that the SFO did not investigate against the British Bank of Standard.
Speaking about that issue, the member of parliament for Kigoma Town, Zitto Kabwe (ACT-Wazalendo) said that the interests of Tanzania in that scandal will be big if the government will succeed to show that the Standard Bank was able to get that business in the country.
Mentioning those benefits, Zitto said, "one, it will be a big lesson to the international companies that Africa is not a place to count and get work and not being punished.
Two, Tanzania will not pay this loan with its interest.
We will have saved more than 2 trillion shillings in the National Debt and pointing out the money we were when we got interest to serve our citizens in health and education, "said Zitto.
