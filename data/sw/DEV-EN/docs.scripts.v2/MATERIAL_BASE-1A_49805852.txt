The transport services of buses to different provinces in the country has increased due to the needs of that service.

However, the needs are supposed to be done by having travel agencies that meet the criteria of road safety.
Due to the presence of the buses that are making a long and short journey, it is required to be a thorough inspection of those organs of the regular fire, so as to be satisfied with the ability of those agencies especially buses to carry passengers and travel especially long distances.
For several years now, we have witnessed the increase in road accidents that are caused by the laziness of drivers or poor condition of the fire equipment, a situation that cost the nation by losing their strength and also to stop the families having orphaned children and those with disabilities.
Despite the road safety laws, some of the drivers have been broken deliberately.
In addition, in ensuring that those buses are traveling are safe, the audit authorities, including the Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA), is supposed to handle them in detail then they should be given the consent of making a journey.
I believe that the inspection will enable the removal of buses that are going to a long way though they are capable of going to a short way, therefore, to avoid passengers and accidents or threats that can be found in the journal, for example the spoiling of vehicles every time and forcing them to go on the way.
There are buses that have been allowed to travel for a long distance, for example from Arusha to Dar es Salaam which is a distance of 600 kilometers, yet his ability is to travel a few kilometers away.
There are some of the buses that are traveling to various provinces while it seems clear that they don't have that ability, a situation that has caused us and caused some to ask ourselves if the authorities concerned with the inspection of quality and the ability of those buses are responsible as required.
It does not mean that those buses do not have the ability to do any journey, certainly, they are attractive to the short journey, thus being required to be given permits for making those trips and not long as those of 600 kilometers or more.
That is important, that's why I insist on a comprehensive inspection.
Other buses outside have good colors but the ability to make the journey were allocated are not, due to them.
It is clear that travelers using those buses get a lot of trouble especially when it comes to them, their lives to be at risk and their property is also in danger, because most of the damaged areas are not safe.
It has been normal to see the passenger bus that is supposed to travel for two or three hours taking six hours, because of getting spoilt after a long distance.
The situation reveals that other buses or not being treated well or should be approved and do a long walk to be endured.
This is dangerous.
I advise the buses that the passengers are making comprehensive inspection so that they are not required to make a long journey to be short.
Let's go on to provide services to a distance that doesn't deserve is to endanger the lives of passengers for accidents that can be avoided.
Traffic police are doing their work well, the passengers also have a good opportunity to inform the drivers who know their lives by driving badly and they also have the responsibility of giving information about the whole trend of the bus, including informing the concerned authorities about poor conditions of the buses that they use to travel if it will be damaged on their way.
The aim is to convince the audit authorities to do well before they allow them to do a short or long journey.
I would like to be understood that, the inspection of the ability and the keenness of the drivers only is not enough to be tickets for the safety of passengers on the journey, but even the quality of the buses itself should be assured.
