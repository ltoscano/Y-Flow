The fight against the use of drug trafficking in the country is expected to take a new chapter, after the East African Development Community (SADC), planning to deal with that business by using collective energy of the country.
Those details have been given Monday this week by the minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation of Tanzania, Bernard Membe, when he was speaking at the television show of general on Monday, run by legendary journalist, General Ulimwengu, every Monday at Channel Ten television station.
Countries that form SADC from Tanzania include South Africa, Zimbabwe, Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia and Seyshelles.
Madagascar has been called for the membership of the community.
It is in some of those countries where some of the countries have been cut off with drugs and the latest incident is the arrest of popular artist Agnes Masogange and Mellis Edward, who were arrested in South Africa at the International Airport of Oliver tambo and drugs that are claimed to have a value of more than six billion shillings.
Speaking about that issue, Minister Membe said the fight against drugs is big and he gave a call to people with goals of wanting to vie for the presidency in the year 2015 to do the fight against drugs to be among their agenda, by considering that the use of those drugs are the destruction of the youth.
Membe who was the leader of SADC observers in Zimbabwe's general elections recently, spoke about the trend of the election saying that the draft constitution will be presented in the next session of the heads of that union that will take place in Malawi.
In the election of Zimbabwe, the ruling ZANU-PF party of President Robert Mugabe (89) which formed a campaign to fight for land and land in the direction of opposing foreigners, especially the whites that own a large portion of land in the country, managed to get a white member of parliament, Joshua Sacco.
Sacco has won the parliamentary seat of Chimanfaith in East and amazing nations to follow the country's politics.
Mugabe has been joked that Joshua is a white man at the end of Zanu- PF.
In the year 2009, Joshua was elected as the deputy secretary of production at ZANU PF on the side of the youth and was the first white person to hold that position in Zimbabwe.
That was surprising is to see the white man in the elimination stage to get the ZANU-PF consent to vie for the parliamentary seat, he voted for the former member of parliament of that party and the deputy minister of economy, planning and investment in Zimbabwe, Samuel Undenge.
