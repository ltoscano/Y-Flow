Last week, the Legal and Human Rights Center (LHRC) organized a forum for the purpose of discussing the existence of the death penalty in the country, it wants to be abolished and ended on claims that it is against human rights as the constitution explains the existence of the right to live.

In that conference, it brought together various stakeholders for the purpose of discussing and expressing their thoughts on the presence of that punishment in the country and its importance.
LHRC says, the right to live is the most basic right and the existence of death penalty is the right example of the violation of that right to live.
Speaking at the conference, which was part of the commemorations to protest the punishment, the Director of LHRC, Doctor Hellen Kijo Bisimba, says the right to live is protected under Article 14 of the constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania of the year 1977, however, their defense and the constitution is not right.
The death penalty in the country could affect anyone who will be found guilty of treason under the 39 and 197 provisions of the law of punishment and so as to be implemented in that punishment, it is until the President has signed a certificate of implementation of the punishment given by the court.
The constitution gives the right protection of living under Article 14 but has also been a defense of non-humanitarian punishment, brutal and intolerance under Article 13 (6) (e).
The death penalty is violating the right to live, a way for the execution of the punishment by hanging is a brutal, non-humanitarian situation and it is capable of humanity.
Moreover, that station is believed that the punishment is conflicting with the constitution of the country by anti-article 14 which provides broader protection against the death penalty, but it is 20 years where the punishment has not been implemented here in the country.
Apart from that LHRC offers reasons for wanting that punishment to be in the country, it reached the time of the existence of a national debate on its presence and implementation of that punishment so that both sides can be revealed in legitimacy.
I am saying that because in the conference organized by LHRC, the sides agreed to continue the existence of that punishment, they went further to be even in religious books they produce the opportunity to be implemented in that punishment for everyone who is faced with that kind of crime.
For example, the Islamic religion explains that some of the faces in the holy book of the Quran, the death is the right to a person who killed him for manslaughter, his right to deny him is not okay.
Furthermore, the other hand explained that continuing to implement the law and when the death penalty will be taken to ensure it is implemented.
It is due to the existence of the situation to have the importance of the existence of a national debate which you will be able to ensure that you finish the issue of death penalty and every side will be able to give them to the community, there are people who do brutal incidents to the extent that the punishment is legitimate for them.
It's on that logic, to be reached when various civil society organizations, to use their time by educating the community to avoid making mistakes that in one way can help them reach a place to face the death penalty.
