Zanzibar Football Association (ZFA) has said that it will use patriotic teachers to teach their national teams in Zanzibar.
That statement was given the day before yesterday by the president of that party, Ravia Idarous during the event of handing over licenses B to 26 coaches who finished the training last month.
He said the national teams will be taught by the people of Zanzibar themselves, who have licenses of Confederation of African Football (CAF).
"We have many teachers with the reputation of being able to teach our teams, therefore we can't see the need to use the teachers from outside to follow our teams," he said.
However, he urged the teachers to be ready to work their licenses, which they will get to reach those who were intended.
"To work well and get a certificate is one, but the second is to release that profession that you have got and to the beneficiaries intended," he said.
In addition, he said that they have a lot of teachers with a license B Zanzibar not little and others have already have a license A because that makes them work as required.
He said in accordance with the regulations that they have placed it, any teacher who will not follow the regulations put in place they will be not together with him.
