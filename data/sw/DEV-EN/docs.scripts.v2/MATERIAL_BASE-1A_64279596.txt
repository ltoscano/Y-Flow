Moreover, he has directed the land officer of that province, Edger Msolla, presenting the names of the officers to the commissioner and police in the region of Dar es Salaam, Simon Sirro, so that action can be taken against them.
He has also urged the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) to observe the Nakoroa Investment company Limited, so as to look at his legitimacy because of being accused of being involved in land disputes and found that it is involved, it is abolished.
Makonda gave those instructions in his last meeting in his 10 days tour in that province, that took place at Mabahoma grounds, Kinondoni district.
Makonda reached that decision after the resident of Mlalbeit, Joyce Machange explained that he was married four houses of his late father who was alleged to be on 200,000 shillings.
The resident claimed that those houses were given 35 days after his father died and the author of Nakoroa Investment Limited.
He said, the order of the land court asked the debtor to change the cost so as to prevent the houses being sold.
He added that after the incident presented the issue at the Provincial Commissioner's office, and Makonda handed it to the land officers so as to listen to them.
Msolla said in the complainant, Nakoroa Investment company presented his documents, they discovered the agent of the court who was appointed to change some of the courts and refused to sign.
