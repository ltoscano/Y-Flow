The second part of this article that was published in this newspaper last Wednesday, explained the statements of various groups of people mentioned to contribute to a non-profit conflict between the North Mara Gold Mine (North Mara Gold Mine - NGrand) and residents of villages that are neighboring that mine.
Those groups include the management of African Barrick Gold (ABG) that runs the mine, the residents of those villages, political leaders and journalists.
Previously, in a special interview with Good Citizen, the district commissioner of Tarime, where it is mine, John Henjewele, who brought the finger to those groups saying that it is the source of that conflict due to putting their personal interests.
However, after being questioned by this newspaper in different times, some people from those groups tried to avoid the blame and others confessed to contribute to that conflict.
This third place and the last part, describes the recommendations that were given by different stakeholders about methods and procedures that can help solve the conflict and eventually improve relations and enable each side to benefit from the quarry at satisfactory level.
The stakeholders suggesting the crisis Augustino Sasi, a resident of the village of Keith, which runs the NGrand, is proposing to have a partnership of sharing benefits that are derived from the mining of minerals in that mine.
That, instead of an investor to pay compensation for various assets of the villagers that are taken to pave way for mine activities, to accept to pay the amount of money that they will agree every month until the mining will end in that area.
"The leadership of the mine agreed to enter into partnerships with us villagers we are taken from the neighborhood to mine, meaning you have given me the amount of money we will agree every month or two months," says Sasi and continued: "The procedure will avoid the complaints that are currently including breaking down and break the compensation of our property.
Therefore, the concrete solution to the current crisis is to enter into partnerships in order to each other side of the gold that is mined in this mine. "
A resident of Tarime town, Samwel Magoiga, is proposing to have a procedure of that mine to ensure that every year you have the council of that district, the benefits of money driven by mining for the sake of costs of improving social services to the citizens.

Magoiga who is the Executive Director of the Tanzania House of Employment Creation - TAHEC), with its headquarters in Mwanza, insists:
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"That strategy will help to end the conflict between the two sides, and especially if the government will use those funds well by solving the problems of the residents of the villages that are neighboring that mine as it is not Tarime in general.

"You know what is happening now is that people organize symptoms (symptoms) of the disease (the conflict) instead of the cause of the disease.
The investor is dealing with the crisis for its benefit, the government will deal with the conflict with the benefit of the investor, while a villager being put aside, that will not end the conflict.
"On the other hand, the crisis is being held by politicians or not knowing, or by knowing.
I think we should agree directly that the amount of income of mine be taken to the district council to be used to solve the problems of the citizens, "insists Magoiga and added:" I have emphasized that, because this problem affects the residents of the villages that are neighboring that mine, the government should have a procedure of cooperating with them closely in ensuring that mine is giving them their rights.
"On the other hand, the ensuring that it helps the first villagers to also be a strong partnership with the investor, the government and villagers to transparency in issues concerning mine, to have a joint statement, but the largest villagers do not have their priorities.
"Another, I heard that the mine wants to start underground mining (low-mining) so as to avoid using a high cost of paying compensation to citizens who are taken from the neighborhood and mine.
I am saying that the technique will not help to end the conflict, instead it will continue to promote the current crisis.
"So, I think villagers are given the first opportunity.
Again I use this opportunity to urge the villagers to use this period of local government elections to choose good leaders with the will and commitment to help solve the conflict. "
The journalist, the representative of awn newspaper in Tarime district, Igenga Mtatiro, says the concrete solution of the conflict is the implementation of the promises that were given by the investor of that mine to the villagers.
"The first thing, the investor will implement contracts or agreements that he entered with villagers including building the Technical Training College (Veta) and giving them before December 31st, 2014.
"It is also an investor to show small miners to get mining areas, modern equipment for extraction, and training on modern technology of driving mining and environmental conservation.
This will help to end the conflict that is with the villagers will not have tensions against the investor in that mine.
"He is also an investor to ensure that he will pay the public compensation for the time.
But also leaders and employees of mine should have a procedure of visiting villagers, to listen to the challenges they are facing and cooperating with the government looking for solutions.
"Another thing, the leaders of mine and the government should stop the tradition of marginalizing journalists in Tarime district and Mara province in general in encouraging investment and mining of minerals in that mine," said Mtatiro.

The District Commissioner of Tarime, Henjewele, has said that the step of removing villagers from the neighborhood and that mine is implemented effectively, it will help to eliminate the conflict between the two sides.

"The investor will implement his role in ensuring that both People live within a distance of 300 meters away from the mine are being treated.
All the people living in the neighboring mine for that distance is supposed to pay compensation for their properties in order to protect themselves because of protecting the safety of their health, "says Henrik.
On their part, the head of police of Kipolisi Tarime / Rorya, the Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Benedicto Mambosasa and the lawyer of NGrand, Abel Yiga, say that the education of citizenship to the villagers about the issue of investment in mines can help solve the conflict.
"The government is cooperating with politicians to work in educating villagers because those sides are being heard by the citizens.
The education gives the citizens the importance and benefits of investment in their areas, "explains Yiga.
"Citizens have the right to be educated on the importance of foreign investors in the country.
It is good for those villagers to know that the investor is legal and the policy of our country is to encourage a good environment for foreign investors, "said Commander Mambosasa.
Unlike other mines, NGrand was discovered in the middle of the people's residence, therefore, in order to break the health effects, it must relocate them to pave way for mining activities that was not harassed after paying the compensation of their various properties.
However, there was a violation of regulations and procedures of paying compensation and transferred from the neighborhood and NGrand, a situation that sparked a conflict between the management of that mine and the villagers.

The tensions are the cause of the acts of invasion, looting, and destruction of various property in the mine committed by some of the citizens, especially young people who are looking for livelihood for subsistence and their families.

Many times the guards of that mine in collaboration with the police have been forced to use a big force that involved tear gas and fire bullets to deal with people who are involved in that crime so as to cause murder among them.
