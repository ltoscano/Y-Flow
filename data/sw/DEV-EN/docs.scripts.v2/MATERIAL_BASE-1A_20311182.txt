Majaliwa gave the statement in his speech that was read on his behalf by the minister of information, culture, arts and sports, Nape Nnauye when he officially launched the system on behalf of the prime minister at the National Stadium yesterday.
In his speech, Majaliwa said that the system will help to put open revenue from the entrance fee of the field due to its transparency in reducing revenue for the concerned day.
He said that for being a person cutting the tickets already the deductions of the Tanzania Revenue Authority, the Tanzania Football Federation, TFF, the deductions of the club and every type of deductions of that day are known and therefore there is no doubt that the system is blocking the theft of entries.
"This is a system that has brought the liberation of a high level in the whole issue of the entrance fee of the field who for a long time has been a big problem, people have been stealing revenue in the way they know them but for now this system is the savior of the Tanzanian soccer and the government in general," he said.
He said that the system will help to note the reports of everyone who will go to the field that day.
Moreover, in that launch, Nape was handed the cards to intervene in the field, President John Magufuli, Vice President Samia Suluhu Hassan together with the prime minister and other big leaders that he has been requested to take action.
Previously before welcoming Nape, the secretary general of that ministry, Professor Elisante ole Gabriel said that 20 machines that use the system were blocked in the field.
He said that under the system, the user can increase money in his card that will be used to intervene in the field where for now the cards are given free.
"Previously the company that involved this service of getting into the field here was to sell the cards to intervene in the field for 10,000 shillings but they are giving us a free card while the user will be required to have added money to get into the field," said Ole Gabriel.
Project manager from Selcom company, Gallus Risteta said that those cards have been put on a modern security system that visited its use while adding in ensuring that it meets the need for the market, Selcom has 16,000 agents in the whole country who are involved in its services.
On his part, the president of TFF, Jamal Malinzi urged the perpetrators to make sure that more education has been given to Tanzania to know the use of that stadium.
He also said that the Premier League clubs depend on the income of the door to run their activities so that the current system must keep in mind the validity of deductions so that the clubs benefit.
"I hope the existence of an open system and sure especially in doing the whole issue of inspection of revenue accounts in order to ensure that every side should benefit, because many clubs are running by depending on the income of the door to see that this system has made them their income," said Malinzi.
