The Advisory Council of the consumer and Marine Services Agency (SUMATRA CCC) have warned the behavior of some of the drivers of the buses parking lot more than the number of seats because, it contributes to insurance companies to fail to pay as passengers when road accidents occur.
It has also advised the existence of a special tool that will fund the treatment of passengers who will have received road accidents so as to ease the discomfort, especially those who don't know the law to claim their compensation soon after recovery.
While speaking in Dar es Salaam yesterday, the education officer of Summer CCC, Nicholous Kinyingly, said the action of passengers allowing the driver to parking more than the number of chairs that are in the transport vessel they use to get their right to compensation when it comes to accidents.
He said there are some drivers and conductors of the buses have had a habit of filling passengers to continue the number of seats, a situation that contributes to passengers to miss their rights by failing to be paid for compensation.
"So that the passengers can be paid compensation and the insurance company when it comes to road accidents, it is a must the owner of the vessel to give a report to the insurance company that he got in his bus within 24 to 48 hours and more than that, the right will be lost, therefore the passengers failed to be paid compensation and insurance and that responsibility remained with a person," he said.
He said because Sumatran CCC is the vessel with the responsibility of defending the buses, it should be understood that the law is not allowed the owner, the driver or the conductor to stop the passengers on the bus and who will take a legal action to be eaten against him.
In addition, he said the road safety law that is used is for a long time since 1973, therefore, there is a need for the government to be using the appeal so that it can go hand in line with the current situation in line with enabling them to punish passengers who will be found in the bus, the owner will allow his car to stop passengers and the driver and the conductor who will be in that bus.
While explaining about the presence of a special body that will fund the treatment to the passengers who will be getting on the road, he said there are some of the casualties because their rights have been lost their rights of being overwhelmed.
