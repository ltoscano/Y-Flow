Apart from the technology that is used to make those ships, the authority has improved the skills of its coaches after taking them to the South African countries, Denmark and France to get training on how to incorporate the ship of that type at the port.
The executive director of that authority, Deusdedit Kakoko said that after the coaches of the authority managed to bring a big ship in the history of Dar es Salaam port with a length of 261 meters.
The ship called MV Hammonia Grenada which has the ability to carry 4,256 rubles, has been forced to dock at the port of Dar es Salaam and to drop 483.
Kakoko said the port of Dar es Salaam has the ability to serve the ship with that size in its fourth dock, which is the dock number eight, nine, 10 and 11 which have a depth of 11 meters.
He said the arrival of that ship is enough evidence that the port has the ability to receive a big ship of that kind, which had previously threatened the port of Mombasa only.
Previously, TPA has already managed another big ship with a length of 250 meters and later it brought another ship with a length of 255 meters.
According to Captain Mwingamno, a 261 meters long boat usually ends the port of Mombasa due to the smallness of the entrance but the arrival of this ship has officially opened the commercial doors.
