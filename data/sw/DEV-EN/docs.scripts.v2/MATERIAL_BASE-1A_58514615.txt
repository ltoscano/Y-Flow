Who was expelled after failing to interview is James Rugby, Fredrick Lyimo, Gerald Munisi, Maiki Warioba and Victor Mwalila.
The secretary of the ARFA election committee, Selemani Kilua said some of the candidates did not meet the criteria and qualifications that among those criteria is a form four certificate and experience of five years in leadership.
"We announced all the candidates that the day of interviews must come up with the real certificate of form four and not copies and by pointing out that is why the candidate who did not come with a real certificate was dismissed so that the elections should be fair," said Kilua.
Previously 13 candidates came out to vie for various positions that are the chairperson, deputy chairperson, secretary general, assistant secretary, treasurer, member of the general meeting, member of the club and three delegates of the executive committee.
The ARFA has been planned to take place on January 8 in the year.
