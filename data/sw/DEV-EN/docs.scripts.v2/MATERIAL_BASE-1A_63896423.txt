The story was written five years ago... the Emirates Stadium... on Wednesday 26 March, 2008 I went to watch the match between Brasil and Sweden in the north of London.
That day, different countries were competing for a friendly tournament.
They said it is friendly but it is competing for before the world cup tournament that will begin in September every place.
I don't know if Taifa Stars will come from what steps, but it is allah these days we are trying, again our coach, a Brazilian, at least we look at the size of the balls.

I have gone to Emirates.
Inside the match, there are non-eyes on the pitch.
Every popular player like Frederick Lundberg (Sweden) or Robinho (Brasil) touched me the noise is getting off, vigils will think the goal has come.
I am going to get this big balls so as to happen in the field than even the ball itself.
There is music being hit.
The kind of people who are there.
Zogo tele tele.
For instance, in 1988 I went to Maracana (U.S. Rio De Janeiro) to watch Brasil struggling with Argentina.
The popular player Diego Maradona was the star of those days.
Brazil and Warsaw are not given out as a dog and a CAT.
I was delighted by the rappers of Maradona (I don't think I have seen a good player like that from that day, maybe Zinedine Zidane); but I don't dare to celebrate.
Brazil's supporters would be killed.
Something interesting...

Then the day before yesterday, the Arsenal stadium, what interesting is that "Mexican Wave" started during the World Cup Mexico (when he played Pele and his colleagues) in 1970.
If you come up to everyone he is taking the hell on foot, he woke up hands in the air, that goes to the whole stadium you are communicating.
And then there are vigils and joy.
OOOOO and AAAA... Kgone to a mom is to attend a hell, meet your fellow human beings, screaming, and cut off.
This is when you see the strength and inspiration of survival.
The Stadium had been jazeera.
You don't think you are surrounded by insects, flowers and chips.
Life.
The strength.
In the past, the ball was said to be at the junction of the path (especially in Europe) singing with bad voices seen and insulting.
These days have changed.
There are people and those who are, men, and women, fighting for young people.
Brazil beat Sweden 1-0 but me is not important.
The importance is to be in the horrible situation, interesting and exciting.
