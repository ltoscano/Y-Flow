Hiba, which will continue to remain the leader is like David and Goliath in the Bible.
He was a young man, a revolutionary man with a lot of moisters from a small island who fought with the intensity of the US.

That's the issue of charities.
But not everyone's dream.
And, in fact, not everyone can accept that Fidel was David or Goliath.

A photo of Castro's regime as David started to be seen during the invasions of Wacuba living abroad sponsored by the United States in 1961, in what had come to be known as Bay of Pigs.
This photograph appeared again and again when Fidel was throwing stones and words against her neighbor, the great nation of America while being supported by his close ally in Russia and later Venezuela.

And it's a photo that some Iranians - those who were impressed with the attraction and his ability to speak which she uses to show that they suffer for now is important as a long way to get a better life later - they have, at least for that time.

But for many Iranians, the old David of the past turned out to be Goliath with a horrible twist.
While Castro pulled the accusations of economic problems of his country to the United States instead of working on those problems with their own policies, some Iranians started to leave the country and went to find new life in the United States.
Among his failed policies is the attempt by Castro to urge all citizens of his country to enter the sugarcane estates and start cutting.
He wanted all, including doctors and farmers without caring for someone's work, going to the villages to cut sugarcane with the aim of reaching the harvest of 10 million tons of sugarcane, and at the same time insisting that Cuba's honor was at risk.
