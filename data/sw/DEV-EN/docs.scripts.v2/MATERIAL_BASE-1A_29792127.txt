The government will take a precaution against the ongoing murders we have used to our country to be a peaceful island.
We live without fear and worry about our life.
But now, we live as people without sure of tomorrow due to the ongoing killings in the country.
Brethren, this is going on in the country not a normal killing.
Actually, it has reached a step by a Tanzanian to slaughter a fellow Tanzanian as an animal without compassion?
Where is our country going?
Even if someone has left the concerned authorities to hold him, but it is not a person to take care of the law and make such violence.
We request the state agencies and the concerned authorities to take urgent warnings.
This seeds that are planted now will come to be a big bomb later in our community.
God bless Tanzania.
Mzalendo is true.
