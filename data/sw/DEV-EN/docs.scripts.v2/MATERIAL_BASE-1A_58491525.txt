This may not be a good year for Cameroon's international striker, Samuel Eto'o, after his national team did badly in the World Cup competition, and he has no team of the club to play after finishing his contract with Chelsea, now he has opened a heavy trial in court.
The cases of humiliation by spreading nude pictures, threats, purchase / sale of humans, fraud, and threats have been opened in a court in Yaounde, Cameroon, and the former Chelsea striker, HÃ©lyne Nathalie Koah.
Earlier last week Koah opened the case against Eto'o who denied the charges.
That step has come a few days after the spread of her naked photos on Facebook, which the former flight attendant has said that they have been distributed by Eto'o who was his lover.
Eto'o has denied being involved in the dirty game, and in response to the beating of the leading player by winning many awards for his performance in Africa, has opened a case of misuse of money ($410,755) that gave Ms Koah for the purpose of opening an institution to help the community when they were lovers.
This woman has been able to get them in beef, Fally Ipupa and Eto'o in confusing his love.
