In addition, he urged them to ban all shops that will be known to sell medicine for use and take action against its owners so as to stop the behavior of those business people who are cooperating with the workers of the health department to steal medicine.
Mpenda has given that directive while inspecting various shipments of drugs that were purchase by the health department, that will be distributed to the clinic and all health centers together with the renovation of a special storage room at Madaba Health Center.
According to him, the health department has a legal responsibility to ensure that every owner of the medicine shop is focusing on the law, regulations and procedures that are available for selling correct medicine for human use and avoid selling drugs that are required to be in the clinic, health centers and government hospitals.
He said that step will help to save the lives of citizens who are a big economic pillar, because without good health there is no work of production that can be done, something that is dangerous to the economy of that council.
He said, some of the owners of the shops have a dirty game of selling counterfeit drugs, an issue that can contribute to poverty because the citizens when they buy those drugs are unable to heal and cause a citizen to use another amount of money to buy medicine which could take them to other services.
The chief physician of that council, Doctor Mustafa Minister said that for now he is proud to see in the clinic and all health centers in Madaba Constituency there is no shortage of medicine.
The District Council of Madaba has 14 clinics, 10 governments and four governments of religious institutions together with three health centers, among them two Madaba and Ndelist centers that are owned by the government and one that is owned by the Catholic Church.
