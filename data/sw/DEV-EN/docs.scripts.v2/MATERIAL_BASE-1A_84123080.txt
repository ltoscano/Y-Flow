The round of the Premier League, the first step has ended recently and for now the teams are in the process of making adjustments to their squads, for the second round of the league that was planned to officially start early next month.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Already some clubs have already started calling for the signatures of new players for the purpose of strengthening their squads for different goals.
The giants Simba, Yanga and Azam are fighting for the championship, there are teams like Mbao, Water Water, African Lyon and others will go to the country to drop the bridge.
Most importantly, the players are required to be careful, not to blame them in their decisions of burning ink in various teams.
Players should ask the heads to make a decision by being convinced, a supporter of the club and the club leaders, especially old when they voted for their neck.
The players, especially the upcoming stars must evaluate their ability and the club they want to go to play for them if they are against them and it will be able to help them develop their talents or get in and finally be the veterans at a small age.
The period of registration is the season of yields not to the players, but even the aides and coaches of the club, it will look for that registration to be done with professionalism of the high level for the benefit of both sides in the meaning of players and the concerned club, so as to end Tanzania's soccer.
We will not expect the folks that have occurred in the big registration window, when Hassan Kessy serving Yanga is still in a contract with Simba, a decision that until today you know him while he doesn't know the fate of his case which Simba have wanted to be paid 600 million shillings.
The first round we have witnessed some of the players while signing up due to cheating and causing them to be punished by the committee of law and dignity of players of Tanzania Football Federation (TFF).
The problem of cheating to the players has been seen to be sustainable in Tanzania, although for a certain period, it has reached especially in the premier league but in the high levels of cheating has been huge and complaints have been many.
In the premier league, the issue of players to register two teams has been a normal thing and has already taken them to the ears of soccer stakeholders because of that case repeatedly.
All the time the registration of controversy in the premier league even if it is contributor usually is involved in the old Simba and Yanga clubs.
All cases that have shaken the media here in the country will involve the clubs themselves by themselves or themselves by other clubs where they are for its player.
We have also witnessed the players being banned for a lot of mistakes like that, that were ever done by players in the past and given punishment by TFF, but the issue is seen to be a difficult thing for the players.
When I know, the greed of money, the us of the law have been passing some of the players and find themselves getting into a crisis that is contributor and others have threatened to be banned from being involved in soccer for a period of six months to one year.
The Association of players of Tanzania Football Association (Souza), although it does not involve the punishment but it is believed that there is a time it is good for the punishment to be given so as to stop the behavior of cheating and building discipline in the soccer game.
"If we will defend this issue because we will be promoting electoral fraud, often we refuse a player to be given a great punishment for being locked up or one year because we believe that it has a great impact because a player is expecting to play as its employment, but in such cases we must build discipline in our players to discover and respect the law," says the secretary general of Simeone, Mussa Kisoki.
Kisoki said it has come now during the players to register in their party so that they can help them manage their contracts and not to wait until they walk to the conflict with their clubs.
They must participate in the players of the Premier League and the First Division League on their rights and responsibilities, their freedom in registration issues and other important things that bring mistakes to players especially in contracts and registration.
The players should be keen in getting contracts and if it will be possible to have the lawyers of supervision.
I believe things are mixed with a lot of attention to both sides of the leaders and the club coaches it is clear we can witness the premier league more than the first one that ended with Simba to sit at the peak with 35 points.
