He suggested that remaining even at the exhibition grounds to be built on a sense of expanding the area and make it modern so as to fix the country, public and private companies, organizations and many more people.
Of course the time has come for thinking about this point of Prime Minister Pinda.
Because all of it is good, that is good, us should go to support the Prime Minister Pinda for his proposal.
Together with the growth of the Saba Saba exhibition, there are still things that are not okay.
There are many areas that certainly don't have a comfort to desire every time to Sabasaba.
And that is the most beautiful country, companies and organizations and individuals.
This point of Pinda, of course, has a lot.
And because the organizers of this exhibition in Dar es Salaam have been getting the opportunity to go to attend an exhibition of our foreign colleagues, they can start in that experience of quality of our colleagues in implementing those instructions by the Prime Minister Pinda.
