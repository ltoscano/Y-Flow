The Provincial Commissioner of Arusha, Mrisho Gambo has urged those who are doing business of parking passengers using a motorcycle transport known as a motorcycle, to have a symbol of the area they are working for, so as to control those who use that transport to commit crimes.

Gambo has given that directive during the opening of the road safety week.
Gambo speech has been read by the District Commissioner of Arusha, Gabriel Daqarro.
He urged the road safety committee of Arusha province to do everything possible to ensure the motorcycle riders have a symbol of the area where they are working.
Gambo has said that now there is an increase in that transport to be used to investigate robbery in the middle of Arusha City, thus having the marks will help to identify those with bad intentions.
He has said that it will help to know whether robbery is done by true criminals or there are some of the business people who are partnering with the criminals to do that crime.
"We must put an effective strategies for the motorcycle riders to have a special symbol of the area where they are working so that criminals can be known and good people to be known.
That will help to know those motorcycle riders and those who are not good and action should be taken against those who do not good for the community, "he said.
Apart from that, Gambo has urged the drivers in Arusha province to run vehicles by following the laws put in place, because many accidents in the province are caused by their non-compliance with the law including driving while driving with speed and causing accidents and killing people without basic reasons.
He said the traffic police are supposed to manage traffic rules and refuse to take bribes because bribery is one of the reasons that increase road accidents.
In addition, he said road accidents have been reduced the year up to the year due to the drivers obey the law, therefore, it is a must that the police should be so far to manage the law so that the situation continues so.
He has said that in the year's statistics in January to October this year, accidents were 2,011 but in the period of this year in January up to October the accident has reduced up to 1,692 accidents.
The police commander of Arusha Province, Charles Mkumbo said the accidents have been reduced the year until the year.
He said in the year 2015, accidents have reduced from 763 to 725 this year, equivalent to five percent, normal accidents have reduced from 972 last year to 911 accidents this year and that is equivalent to 6.2 percent.
He said the motorcycle accidents have reduced from 763 accidents last year to 614 accidents this year and that is equivalent to 20 percent of the motorcycle accidents.
