This government's war by doctors Ikome, Jul 16, 2012
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Our country is in sadness of the conflict between doctors and the government.
It is the sorrow and worry.
Suluhu's fighting has not been found.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
It is sad, because, this is our country, they read it is our doctors and that is criticized is our government.
It is the citizens of this country who are concerned and even lost their lives due to this strike.
This is very sad.
It is something that supports our country.
Behind there, we insisted, and here I started to insist on my stand as a Tanzanian who loves my country, that there is no other way to end this conflict but it is through a brotherly relationship and friendly talks.
The characters have to sit on the table as a tweet and recipe for this crisis for the benefit of our country and its People.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
For now, every side you see a colleague is the one who is wrong.
Therefore, each side has run handles and develop a "war of fighting."
The truth, in the war, there will be no winner, because, as a nation, we all have failed.
And we continue to fail More, because our People are dying for lack of reliable treatment.
Basically the claims of doctors is basic and that's not about.
And the government's concerns are fundamental and that will talk about.
Therefore, both sides can talk to the right direction.
It is not a wisdom for now for doctors to continue with their strike when the doors of the conversation has not been given a bronze medal, and not wisdom as well as the government "to boycott" talk to doctors on the pretext that the issue is in court.
I join religious leaders who urged the government to cancel the case and strengthen this case at the table of talks.
It is good and it is wise now for doctors to announce, for the benefit of our country, to postpone their strike immediately and go back to work to serve the customers with all heart.
They do that even in the difficult environment they have, while the efforts to reach the right time and the government continues.
I mean, any strike is a loss.
Every day that goes with the strike means a loss to the country and its people.
He's a loss of money and survival.
That is why all the two sides are supposed to ensure they meet and find solutions to fighting hands.
And in this twist, if there will be a situation of disagreement between the government and doctors, then, the Association of doctors to start now think the good way to run strikes different from this current.
For instance, in accusing the government we could not have a strike to one hospital and not the whole country.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
It can also not be for a whole hospital but several units while services in other units continue.
However, it could defend the disturbance and reach the government to discuss with doctors in improving their interests.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
But this is "Wild strike" because of the nationwide strike has a "health risk" to the nation.
Let it reach a place to contribute to our own country to go through cracking on strikes.
I have been able to write, that it is true, to be almost every Tanzanian who woke up in the morning, or it is a patient or he has relatives, relatives or a patient.
Therefore, there are millions of people from Tanzania with different kinds of diseases.
It is a Tanzanian who depend on the medical services that are given by our doctors.
And in our countries, the doctor is a very important friend of a citizen.
It is a very bad thing, when the government comes to conflict with doctors.
If you go to the conflict with the friends of the citizens.
There is no place anywhere in the world, the citizens came out to hate doctors.
Therefore, it is a tragedy when the government is unable to finish his differences with the citizens of the citizens through the way of talks and even reach the point of doctors who refused.
In our countries, the medical surgeon who was shown to the money of paying taxes and for many years is needed.
Assistant medical officer is needed.
And even if he was to be the assistant physician of the medical officer, he would be much needed.
Similarly, the midwives and assistants, senior nurses and their assistants.
They are all needed.
In our countries, the government should not supposed to reach a step to threaten and even fire the doctors.
That's an end to happen only when all other ways of finishing different ways to resolve conflicts and doctors will have been denied.
And why are competed for?
Well, all of Tanzania would like to see this fight between the government and the doctors to be resolved quickly for the search of hands.
Nash again, the biggest for now, is for both sides in this conflict to recognize that for now the tension is going on will not give a winner, it is because, in what happened and what is happening right now, all of us, as a nation, we have failed.
This is time to put it wise and wisdom.
We should do all, but, the Arabs of the Arabs of the conflict is now a conversation in the atmosphere of torture, then.
God bless Tanzania, God bless Africa.
