In that plan to reduce the problem of employment to the youth in the country, Zantel Company has organized to create employment to the youth.
Speaking during the launch of the shop and the new customer service center located in China Plaza Kariakoo, Dar es Salaam the day before yesterday, chief executive officer of Zantel, Benoit Janin said that in collaboration with the government will create employment to youths as sales agents together with Azerbaijan agents.
He said that is the second center in Dar es Salaam, that is helped by various parts of the service, where Zantel has a plan to open more shops to provide services so that its customers can access services and products anywhere.
"In this shop, if there are other shops in Tanzania, our customers will get services and different products with the quality of 4G together with other standards that will be able to meet various needs.
"These products are being sold at an affordable price, an issue that will make many of the owners of communication devices that are important for the century.
"For example, we have a special phone for students and business people, that have been given cheap packages.
These can help them make communication wherever they are, "he said.
Janin said all shops have employees with knowledge and skills and they are ready to serve their customers and help them when they need internet services, which are currently important in daily life.
He said that while at the final stages of improvement of their network, they are ensuring that they share products and services so that they can be able to reach customers easily.
The opening of the shop in Kariakoo area is one of the strategies of the company to move its services closer to customers, whereby recently the employees of Zantel did a tour in various provinces in the country to speak to their customers.
