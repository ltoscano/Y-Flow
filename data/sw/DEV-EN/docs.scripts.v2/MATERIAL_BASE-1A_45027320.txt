The ministry's statements, BMT to be consistent W last week, the Ministry of Information, Arts, Culture and Sports together with his body, the National Sports Council (BMT), made statements about the stand of those agencies in sports this year.
Those statements were made in a special interview with this newspaper when he wanted to hear the voice of the government after starting the new year of 2017.
The deputy minister of information, arts, culture and sports, Anastazia Wambura said the government is giving a warning to the leaders of sports parties that this is a year of implementation of sports in actions and the time of bringing the propaganda is over.
Wambura insisted that this year will be a problem for leaders who are used to lead sports in tension and that the government will need the implementation, efficiency and the aim is to make a year to be successful.
He said 2017, to be the year of preparation for the Commonwealth Games of 2018, the African Games of 2019, and the Olympic Games that was planned to take place in the year 2020.
Wambura said the government wants to see every leader of the game of the game is implementing its responsibilities, including a year of success.
BMT, through his secretary general, Mohamed Kiganja has promised that 2017 will not be a year to shame the leader of any sports party that will fail to implement its responsibilities fully.
Kiganja has said that it has passed the year of implementation of those actions, bad leaders should inform them and that it will start in the district to the nation.
He said starting from now the preparations song will not come to heads of sports parties and he has planned to meet with them tomorrow so as to start giving strategies.
When we add that plan, especially since the government has already seen the weakness of the year 2016 which Tanzania continued to be the head of this madness.
Such statements are creating, but on the basis that they should not end up being a statements to the media, it turned into a strong implementation and actions.
This issue of the minister crossing parties to make and implement the activities and BMT to control the leaders who sell sports parties to the village, it will reverse the honor of this sector.
A citizen can ask ourselves now, Tanzania is estimated to have 50 million people at the moment, where we get 100 athletes who are iva in different games to represent the Olympic Games?
The fact is that most of the sports parties are not in the sake of sports, they are not in order to manage sports programs to their parties, more than turning the village to look and look for international federations that are being sent to the development of the concerned games, but there is no matter of what is being hit.
For starting, we think the ministry and BMT to make a census of parties that are in the country, the existing games and remaining the ones that do not agree, to be improved, get better to follow and remain a few things that will have the ability to meet the expectations of the citizens especially the lovers of the concerned game.
We believe, together with those statements, the collective power between the ministry, BMT, Directorate of Sports Development, the registrar of parties and sports clubs together with the Olympic Committee of Tanzania (TOC).
