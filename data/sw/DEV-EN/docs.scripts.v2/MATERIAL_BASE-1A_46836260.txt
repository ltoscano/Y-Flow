Speaking to journalists at the headquarters of the defender in Ohio, Dar es Salaam yesterday, Mathew Kasonta who is the representative of Capital Plus International that is organizing those races, said this year's competition will be different because it involves various ages from children, people with albinism and the youth.
"We thank the NMB Bank for their great support which has been able to take place in this year's competition, but the big thing to be proud of us that this year's competition will involve different ages and races that will be avoided is 21 kilometers, 5 to the disabled, 3 kilometers for the elderly and one kilometers to the children," said Kasonta.
The representative said the aim of giving an opportunity to the youth is to prepare the future athletes that will fly the Tanzanian flag in various global competitions including the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020.
He said the competition has a great history because it is the ones that are leading the legendary athletes in the country including Suleiman Nyambui winner of the silver medal in the 5,000-kilometer race in the Olympic and Felix Simbu who held the fifth position in the Rio 2016 Olympics.
Sangu urged various athletes of the Lake Region to come out to fill the forms that will give them a chance to participate in the races of this year and to mention the areas where those forms will be found to be in Nyamagana Stadium, St. Again, CBE, Isn International School, Mallya sports center, Geita Gold Mine all Mwanza and Shinyanga and in Simiyu Province to remove the regional sports officers.
NMB has started sponsoring the Rock City race competition since the year 2009 and getting interested in the competition which every year has continued to perform well to the winners who won various prizes.
