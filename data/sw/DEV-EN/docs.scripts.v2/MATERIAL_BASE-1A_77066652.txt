Depending on the stakeholders to help die each other and we don't know how we can build the ability of involving the community, we involve different friends and also because we ask the prime minister of the name is under paying the ILO there we don't discriminate anyone because it does not benefit me to tell everyone that there does not believe Kalaba completely with children and communities there are Christians there is God, that's the child was born completely without caring about it is children.
Grazing from the kitchen, we will be following the child to learn from their mouth, therefore it is a daily school that helps the child to be independent
And help reduce the burden on the families who are calling for answers that you have been met.
