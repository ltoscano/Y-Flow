Speaking on phone yesterday, the coach who is his fellow musician Felix Simbu has won five in the Olympics of Rio said yesterday through the phone that he will not expect him to contest because he had already led in a very big position of RT.
"I don't have a plan to contest because I am already leading the top position of the athletics leadership here in the country, therefore I will pray for a position when the presidency is the highest position, signatures," said Francis.
He wanted the president who will be chosen in that election to give responsibilities to its members of the executive committee if he wants to work well and to promote that game in the country.
He said most of the delegates of the executive committee of RT after being elected have not been involved with the activities of that game and to sit just as they leave the president and the secretary general they put it next to him.
