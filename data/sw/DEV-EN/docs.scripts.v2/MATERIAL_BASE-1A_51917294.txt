SMS for love made a passion from him since I got to you aunt.
I'm 38 years Old and I've got it.
The day before yesterday I got SMS of love for my wife's phone and since that day my feelings of his affair have been done.
What should I do?
Through the SMS will depend on who was the one who wrote that message.
If he is, then there is words.
If it is a man, do not tolerate your wife because it is normal for women to be led and perhaps he does not have any activities with him.
Speak with him about that message so as to know the step of taking.
I had the knowledge on my aunt, I was wrong in the things up to my friend when I used me to use drugs.
Since that time I have nothing wrong.
Now my mother is saying that I have a close plan.
What should I do to come back to my previous situation?
Through SMS, it is wrong to use any drugs without the doctor's instructions.
My advice is that it's a doctor that makes me feel like he will help him.
