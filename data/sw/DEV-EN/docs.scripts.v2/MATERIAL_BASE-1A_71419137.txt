Ndanda got that goal in the ninth minute scored by Omary Mponda after scoring the ball of Ramadhan Malima of Toto and knowing the net.
Malima has been lucky because yesterday he played his first match of his team and caused the team to be defeated.
That is the second match Toto is losing home, another is against Mbeya City that was played last week.
After that match, Toto fans stormed their coach Rogassian Kaijage urging him to destroy their team thus they want to leave.
However, the police stopped the violence and the fans of that team started singing "best Tegete (John-coach of Toto) than Kaijage."
Speaking to this newspaper after that match, Coach Kaijage said he was preparing to resign anytime.
"I don't have to say but I am preparing to resign anytime from now. (Yesterday)."
