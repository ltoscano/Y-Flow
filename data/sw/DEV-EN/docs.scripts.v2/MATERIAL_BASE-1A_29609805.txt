The CCM grounds for the best infrastructure in the past few weeks I heard the Minister of Information, Nape Nnauye saying the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) has a responsibility to sit with stakeholders including the owners of plots, to check the procedure of putting modern equipment in the fields that are used for the premier league games so that it can be easy to serve the players when they are faced with problems in the field.
Nape gave that advice in Mwanza town during the preparation of a special game that was organized for the purpose of contributing to the family of the player Ismail Halfan to lose life in heart attack at the end of last year.
Editor, advice of minister Nape is good but it is good that he would have directed them to the Revolutionary Party who are the owners of many stadiums that are used in the premier league.
CCM is the owners of the grounds like CCM Kirumba, Sokoine, Majimaji, Nangwanda Sijaona, Jamhuri Morogoro and Dodoma and Samora.
Being the owner of the grounds, CCM has a responsibility of putting important medical services to the players.
