The panel of three judges led by Judge Ignas Kitchen issued an order to stop the case yesterday, until their constitutional case filed in the Supreme Court will be released.
That step is as a result of requests submitted to the suspension of that case which was submitted by the lawyers of the defense, Martin Matunda and Mabere Marando, claiming the prosecution opened a case in the Supreme Court claiming to be violated the constitutional right and the executive chairman of IPP companies, Reginald Mengi.
In that case, it is alleged that, on April 23, last year, Mengi used the media to judge him by calling the "corrupt Pope" before the Kisutu Resident Magistrate Court who is listening to the case against their client has not given judgment.
Those lawyers are demanding the petition requesting for legal interpretation because they believe the right of his client has been broken.
Apart from Mengi, Jehovah has opened the case against the Attorney General, and the Director of Public Service (DPP) who claims that their positions failed to fulfill their responsibilities after Mengi made the judgment through the press.
In another case, the accused has taken an appeal to oppose the decision of the Supreme Court that ordered the files of the cases that are facing him by his colleagues, to return to the Kisitu court to continue.
Jews together with Devon Patel, Amit Nady and Ketan Chohan are facing four cases of theft of money from the EPA account in Kisitu court, that was opened in November last year.
