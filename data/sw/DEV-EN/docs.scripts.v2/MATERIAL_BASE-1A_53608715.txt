The secretary general of the National Sports Council (BMT) has wanted the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) to change and stop using a lot of time to discuss the issues of the coach they left instead of discussing how they can help the development of Tanzanian soccer.
That issue has been troubled by many stakeholders because the officials of that federation have been discussing the salary issues of the former coach of the Taifa stars Charles Mkwasa instead of knowing the plans they have through the interim coach to take the national team.
He said that TFF should stop continuing to discuss the news of the coach who was left and instead he has urged them to focus on the right way of running the Tanzanian soccer and eventually doing well at the international levels.
He said that many leaders have been running things in practice and find themselves working on the sidelines, the situation that makes Tanzania soccer to be lower as the days will continue to move forward.
"I don't see if there is a need to call the media and feel to pay the coach because there is no benefit in the sports world because there is no benefit in the sports world because there is nothing they can learn under football leaders more than to continue to promote conflicts," said Kiganja.
On his side, Lucas Mponela said that TFF has been the best to talk about Mkwasa's salary and to stop the important issues of conflicts of players and finding a solution to the problem that bothers them.
He said there are many charges that had been taken by different clubs and complain about their rights but TFF have been fired without working on their grievances and find problems every day due to following their rights for a long time.
He added that the issue of paying the salary Mkwasa was a secret of two sides, therefore there was no reason for TFF to put open those issues, something that showed losing time in doing so many basic issues.
Mkwasa was sentenced to his contract with TFF a few days ago with his contract with his contract with a period of three months to train the national team and his position was taken by the interim coach, Salum Mayanga who has already started his work.
