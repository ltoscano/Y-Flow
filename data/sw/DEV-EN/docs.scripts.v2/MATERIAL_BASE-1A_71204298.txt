Politicians are using ethnicity as a weapon to fight for the leadership in Kenya.
Occasionally we received a message from various sectors that we should not be ethnic.
I would like to say why to be proud of the diversity of our ethnic backgrounds should not be wise instead of being an issue to divide them as Kenyans.
The politicians especially consider this ethnic issue as a weapon of competing for political leadership by leaving us that they defend "tribe" or our.
Kenya, and the whole world, there are only two types of tribe.
Rich and poor.
Their problems are all around the world regardless of the issue of skin color or tribe.
So, if Kenyans are supposed to think about three times before you accept to be separated from the basis of the tongue that we talk to our traditions.
Visit our tribe and its first differences then we will be able to respect our colleagues.
The youth don't stop the war with ethnic conflict but they will keep their fate in the future.
