DR Lwaitama, was right to ask Precision Air to use the Swahili language to give instructions to two senior officials of the air travels have said Msafiri will not be forced to know the language used in the plane but the airline officers are the responsibility of ensuring that their client gets communication with the way he will understand.
They have said that they were required to use even a sign.
They have said that in East Africa, army officers should use either Swahili, English or French (the main languages of this region) to communicate with their customers, and impossible to use the sign.
On the issue of Dr.Lwaitama, they said that the issue was about how to open an emergency door, why if they failed to tell him that Swahili was even in a sign they would have abandoned you than telling him if it is not in English from the seat?... you quote several sections of the Civil Aviation law .Source: Power Breakfast Clouds fm.My Take: DR. is right and a lot of institutions in Tanzania are still ignoring our cultures and to promote our colonial era!
