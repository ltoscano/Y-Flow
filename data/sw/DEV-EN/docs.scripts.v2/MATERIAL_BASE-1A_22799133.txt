Moreover, the Egyptian government has said it has been doing awareness to the business people of that country to come and invest in various sectors in the country including the health sector.
That has been explained by the Egyptian ambassador in the country, Yasser Elshawal while speaking to this newspaper in his office in Dar es Salaam yesterday about the humanitarian aid that was given by the government for the victims of the Kagera earthquake.
He said Tanzania's economy is growing by seven percent per year, but the government can increase the growth by opening doors to more investors.
He added that Tanzania is doing very well in the issue of the growth of the economy and that it can look at what is doing so as to attract more investors and grow the economy in the country.
"My country has an intention of encouraging Egyptian investors to come and invest in Tanzania for the benefit of both sides," said Ambassador Elshawal.
Speaking about the donations, he said his country has given donations for the purpose of helping the victims of the earthquake especially considering the relationship that is between Tanzania and Egypt.
"It is a donation that was given by Egypt for the purpose of Tanzania who were affected by the earthquake in Kagera province," he explained.
He said the Egyptian government has given medicine, other medical equipment and tents worth 70,000 American dollars which is equivalent to 140 million shillings.
"Those equipment already have already handed it to the prime minister's office, the department of Maafa for the purpose of being transported to Kagera," added the ambassador.
The aid was made by the Egyptian Cooperation Agency and the Egyptian Red Cross.
On September 10, this year 17 people died and 440 others were injured due to the 5.7 magnitude earthquake using the "Richter."
The earthquake also destroyed 2,063 houses while another 14,081 houses were in danger after getting a crack.
