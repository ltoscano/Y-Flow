Some of the scholars on education issues, have supported the government's step of wanting all schools that provide a lot of education, to follow two years of studies on details that they make students get time to rest, but also give an opportunity for the government to implement its educational plans.

While speaking yesterday with this newspaper, the scholars said there are issues that are being done by the government even to private schools and gave an example of sports and secondary schools together with the examinations of the national exams.
Professor Justin Galabawa of the University of Dar es Salaam said that the operators of the school in the country must agree with a two year education system which gives the student an opportunity to breathe.
He said that a student is running for a long time in school like that period of three years, his productivity in the performance of examinations is poor.
"It is good to have two seasons, this gives students a chance to breathing at home in the middle of that period and even when they return to school they are and Mori to read more," said the education expert.
He said any education system in the world must follow the requirements of the government so as to give an opportunity if there are activities that are implemented by the government among those schools that will not be affected.
"For example, there is a moment there is a moment there is a games of crashtag and Umiseta, this is a competition involving all government and non-government schools, how can it be done when other schools are blocked and others continue with studies?
She asked.
He said the decision by the government to want all schools to have two years is good, because even when the government is postponed something, if doing the Mock exams will involve all schools because all of them are made in one system.
"I advise my fellow school owners to follow this procedure is good, not to end the government, these are leading the education system in the country," said Professor Galabawa who also owns Thomas More Machina Secondary School in Dar es Salaam city.
And Professor of Engineering construction of the University of Dar es Salaam, Aloyce Mayo, who is also the director of Alpha Secondary School, said a two term system that has been set by the government is good for all schools that are educated.
Professor Mayo said that two seasons which in the middle has a short break, and he is questioning, "I know why some of the owners are holding onto three years, I do not see if it has a lot of productivity different from this two."
He said he is one of the leaders of private schools and through their union, they don't see the school problem having two seasons.
He added that the problem has been there more to the owners of private schools that are the believers of three years.
"It's possible for them to have basic reasons, but to me two years that has mid-term (a short break) is good for the running of the school," explained Professor Mayo.
There have been news that there have been tension between the government together with some of the owners of private schools about the period of studies.
The government has released a new document of the year 2015 which directs that all schools must have two seasons and a short break to each other.
But private schools themselves have been paying three years on claims that it provides an opportunity for children to be home during rains and cold and also get affordable parents and guardians in issues of paying fees.
