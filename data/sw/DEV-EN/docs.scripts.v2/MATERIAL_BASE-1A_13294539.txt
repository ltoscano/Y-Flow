That grant has been given through a special program of the government of that country to fund the studies and training of Irish Aid's Felipe Training Programme that is supervised by the Irish Government.
The Ambassador of Ireland in the country, Paul Sherlock, speaking at the event of announcing the funding at the embassy of that country, Dar es Salaam, congratulated those who received that opportunity.
"I celebrate everyone for this opportunity.
Since the start of this program 40 years ago, we have helped more than 200 Tanzanians who are participating in the Irish Aid program's Felipe Training Programme, "said Ambassador Sherlock.
He added that the program is important in the relationship between Tanzania and Ireland and the training was started to help achieve the goals that were set by the government of Tanzania in its second phase of development, which is being implemented in five years.
Areas where the beneficiaries of that funding will be oma in their postgraduate studies are sustainable agriculture, nutrition and managing and evaluating the health and they will be studied at the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM), the University of Sokoine (SUA), the University of Dodoma (UDOM) and Mzumbe University.
He said the beneficiaries are the professionals who agreed to focus on their professional area and when they finish their studies, they will be ready to work with their institutions and to use the skills they get to help the whole community.
Yesterday also, 10 Tanzanian shillings were given certificates of identification for finishing the degree of diploma this year through that program, including two who received scholarships to study in Ireland.
