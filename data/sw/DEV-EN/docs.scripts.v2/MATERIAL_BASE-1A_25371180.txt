Parents have expressed concerns about the safety of their children who have reported in dormitories at the time of the teachers' strike when it comes to the fourth day.
Through the parents party in KNAP, parents want the government to ensure that those students who came to dormitories and others are protected as required.
The secretary general of that party, Mister Musau Ndunda, said that parents have a lot of fear that perhaps the children who are in schools this time where there are no teachers, they faced the effects of every kind if the government will not be responsible and give enough protection.
"We are urging the Ministry of Education to be fast and to conduct inspections in all high school schools so as to ensure that the chief teachers are there.
It is this one that will assure our children safety, "said Mister Ndunda when he spoke to the nation today through phone yesterday.
Parents also fear that the students who are alone in school are starting to get into the movements that it should not be moral.
Miss Evelyne Magige, who is a parent of a student at the high school of the school. I was one of the parents who wanted the government to make everything that they want to protect students who are in the dormitories and they have not been returned home.
"I hope that this strike would end quickly because I took my daughter to a dormitory.
Now I am not sure that he is taking care of the school or if he is in safe hands or not, "he said.
On his part, Miss Patron Oduor says he didn't take her daughter to school yesterday because of fear of his safety.
"I suspect that he will not be safe in school without adequate supervision from teachers.
I decided to continue staying at home until things will be safe and the teachers finish their strike, "said yesterday when he spoke to the nation today.
The parents also said they are threatened by the system of teachers and officials of the teachers who are on strike, who enter into the school to evict students and teachers who were able to strike and who are continuing with studies.
