The Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar (SMZ) has set aside Saateni market that is in the area of Unguja Town for the purpose of being used by small traders where all the important infrastructure is complete.

That was said by the minister of state, the office of the president, regional administration and local government, Haji Omar Kheir when he was responding to a question by the representative of the Mwera region, Juma Nhunga who wanted to know why small traders are oppressed in doing their work in Darajani area.
Responding to the question, Kheir said there is no abuse of any kind by the government to the business people until now, except the problem is there for some of the traders to fail to follow the procedures and regulations.
He said that the government has built Saateni market for the purpose of small business people to do their work well and transferred Darajani and Mwanakwerekwe C.
However, he said there are some business people who benefit the directive and continue to do those businesses in those areas where in the map of the city have been built to build modern business buildings.
"The Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar insists that there is no type of violence that is being done to small business people in Zanzibar, we have allocated the Darajani and Mwanakwerekwe C area," he said.
He said the Darajani area is currently in a map of increasing business including the construction of modern shops.
