The acts of theft, robbery have continued to Mbagala Abdul Fumba, Mbagala car, Toyota Noah, was destroyed by a special vehicle, after a knock of a house in Tabata Dampo area in Dar es Salaam the day before yesterday, due to the rubble that fell on the road without being distributed.
Picture by Salim Shao editor, I call this call to the police force to take a step quickly because we the residents of Mbagala, Temeke district has now been a normal thing to hear the bullets.
Although it is difficult to know what happens, but we have witnessed several people who have been attacked, stolen and injured by being shot.
I suspect there is a shipment of weapons that are owned by people or groups and be used in these events.
For example two weeks ago people who were not known were heard seven times.
These people came from the Chamazi area and the shots showed that they were walking on the road and threatening people every time they were shooting in the air, maybe so that they should follow or not come out to the areas they pass.
I think if the police will do a crackdown in collaboration with citizens can use those weapons because these people do not live in heaven but it is here in the world.
