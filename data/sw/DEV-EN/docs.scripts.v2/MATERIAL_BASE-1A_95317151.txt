In Dar es Salaam, Dar es Salaam, there are many challenges that cancer patients are meeting them especially for women who have breast cancer.
Those challenges have caused those patients to cut up and continue with treatment and decided to cut the dose and return to their homes.
That situation happens after getting tired to struggle to find money to afford the cost of drugs while talking to stigmatization while being away by coming to the Ocean Road Hospital (ORCI) which covers treatment and investigation of the disease.
A big challenge that many victims are asking to be assisted is together with the availability of medicine in the type of Chemotherapy which is given as treatment in that hospital.
Speaking recently during the launch of the Hope of the Woman, one of those patients, Biwitnesses Shaiza, says they are usually told that those drugs are free but when they ask them often they are told that they are forced to buy in foreign shops where they are sold expensive.
"I have paid that dose in the first round with a lot of problems with a cost of 200,000 shillings after being told that the drugs are not found in the hospital, here I didn't know the second and third dose I will get it," says Shaiza.
He explains that he went to Tanga province to follow the service in Dar es Salaam city after his brother helped him to afford the cost of distance since it was difficult to serve him while there.
Another patient Mwajuma Mohamed, says the community has not been educated enough about that disease and many women are not going to the hospital for believing that they can undergo surgery and died.
He claims that the current community in some areas and especially rural areas do not believe that the breast cancer patient can undergo surgery and saw it.
He explains that even when he discovered that he had that disease in the year 2013, he got tired of telling her brothers that he believes that they will not accept the surgery to remove the breasts.
"I was afraid to tell them because there are others who are known to have surgery to be bad and there are those who believe that even radiation has effects.
"But after a long time I saw the swelling that was going to grow, I made a decision to go to the hospital and they advised them to cut off, I saw the same because there are those who have refused to appeal and their condition is bad, therefore I involved brothers and agreed to help me," he says.
Mwajuma says there are still faith in witchcraft about that disease and there are people who believe that infected with AIDS, therefore they will build cancer victims as they feel they can be infected.
And the Director of Tanzanian Cancer support and Hope Faundation (TCS-Hope), Halima Kasungu, says many patients have returned to their villages after failing to afford the cost of buying those drugs for all the doses and other problems that they get there.
"The Chemo drug is very expensive for low-income earners fail to afford.
While another one is sold 300,000 shillings, those patients who came to follow the services are given up, they have rejected a dose and decided to return to where they came from, "says Kasungu.
