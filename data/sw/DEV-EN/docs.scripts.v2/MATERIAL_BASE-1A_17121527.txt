The concerns of taxi drivers who are not normal Dogs from technology, says they can't say that Uber is bad because they can't compete with digital change.
He says that the business is good because the employed are Kenyans, so if there was a youth who had no work to do, Uber has given the opportunity.
"We know the change in the country is good, Uber's cars will consider the client's safety and the driver.
"If people see Uber they put a bribe, it's not bad for other techniques to capture customers, they started their website that will help them get customers easily, but if we will continue beating then we should know that we are continuing to announce business without us knowing," says Kurdish.
He says that Uber has come with great strength since their daily business has been thrown away from their vehicles and it has been known quickly than other companies that are in that country.
He says there are many companies in Kenya that are doing that work but has not received the popularity as it is for Uber.

I would have for a Week I got around 12,000 (equivalent to 240,000 shillings), "he says.
And Joseph Egyptians, says Uber is working without having a special station, something that makes the country revenue because they won't be taxed.
He says that the business has also constructed the caste in that country because it notes the rich and the poor.
"These Uber are good except those who made it wrong, the elderly who want to do this work fail because they can't use smartphones (modern phones).
"But we have also inspected the vehicles, that is a car like this (showing off his car) does not work with Uber because its number is A," says Egyptians.
He insists that the old vehicles will not be allowed and that they want new cars with number C and D. for example vehicles with number KCW, that is a good that is supposed to work with Uber.
He says 50 percent of the owners of vehicles especially taxi drivers who are using their vehicles, an issue that makes it difficult for others to borrow because the criteria and conditions needed is difficult.

He insists that other companies that do work like Uber including Mundo, will TAX themselves have stickers of the council in their different cars and it is for Uber.
Speaking about the issue of affordability, he says that Uber are not afforded because they are tired of distance while looking at the kilometers they used, and that if the road is a queue, it is a must for costs.
He says that they agree with the customer before they begin the journey, therefore, if it is far, close to the road has queues, losses are usually a customer.
"There is no conviction, again you can realize that they are above us.
When I get a customer must I will look for a short message so that I can go back and look for another customer, but he can be able to take the procedures again in a different way so that the project has a lot of money, that is our difference, "says Kamau.
