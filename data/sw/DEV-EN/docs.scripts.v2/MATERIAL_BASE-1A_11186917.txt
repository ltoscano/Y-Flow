These semi-finals means that it's always working for a living living with a person who is not dealing with.
As yesterday, this week has made it good to give our youth palm, this time when we start the year can help them in front of the journey.
This column has already written about misconceptions that have been established in some of the youth during the studies at different levels of education that they are studying for the sake of their parents or guardians and others it reaches a step of boycott the school such as studying for their parents or guardians.
The truth is that you read for your own life and your family will start and not otherwise.
The following issue can give you light on those things.
It was at night, in one of the rest areas at the end of the week in Dar es Salaam city when I got to capture this story.
I was impressed by the stories that I've got my neighbor I was with me with ideas from neighboring countries of Kenya.
He told me that two parents who were working and living in a good house in Nairobi, found themselves having to take action that they did not expect after bringing their son to every state until the age of 35 while still under their Empire.
According to his predecessor, at the time of that life, the young man gets all the services to parents and he every told the news of certain work he refuses to claim that it is not good.
The father was not enjoying the situation but because he loved his boy and because he loved his boy and because the ability of money allowed him to be in any step.
Finally, he was married at the age of 35 and therefore his parents moving them to a house to live a home worker.
The new couple, they got the first child, then the second and later they were born in three times while all of them and their children receiving all the services of life from their parents, an amount of being given a car for their private transport and their family.
Here I would like to remind of also the famous saying that you are saying; "the child you know." "
When he saw his family continues to expansion and his parents are still living in a big house, prompting her father that it is good for him to each other with his parents, because they are only two, then they live a small house of a servant.
According to the story, that is where his father ran out and took action.
What he did is to pay her child house for six months and accusing them that during that period he will repair a big house together with the sleeping house of a servant and then they will return to those houses to live.
Therefore, the young man agreed as he said his elder.
In that period, the father was forced to reduce the use of his child and putting them into business so that he does not continue being dependent on everything.
Before a period of six months ended, the father will sell his house and moving to another area without his son to know.
When it came back to their house he found another house and remained open.
The efforts to repeat of his father told him that he does not even have money to pay for a house without being told it is his responsibility to preserve his family and not otherwise.
What follows is a cry and grinding teeth for being faced with the thick darkness of life.
This story is enough for the young people who come from the authority and power of their parents are vulnerable to them as they have positions and power like that.
There are children of directors, provincial heads and districts and even popular business people who have seen that they do not need to work for their lives because they have not seen them having power and those properties as they are their parents.
They think that they don't need to feel looking for their property.
This is a misconception and the youth must change.
This is possible that we should stop being complacuated by the property that are not yours.
Look for your name because they are rushed, they say "a lot of charities are poor."
