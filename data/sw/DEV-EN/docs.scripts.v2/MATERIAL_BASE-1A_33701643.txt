The condition of the presence of the general elections of the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) that is expected to take place in August this year is the one that is mentioned by some of the analysts of soccer issues in the country to be one of the something that produces a lot of bugs right now.

He wanted to return to the benzene to some of the leaders and other leaders wanting to get into power has made leaders who are in power right now to forget their responsibilities to Tanzania and focus on campaigns to defend their seats.

This is what makes football making a lot of fun, not another.
Every leader in power is looking at how he will be part of the next mainstream leaders.
If you don't have the leader of this way, expect to meet with the "movie" you are witnessing this time.

The events that we continue to see is due to lack of concrete leadership that would be able to prepare well and to manage the ball themselves so as to avoid the situation.
If chief leaders are not concerned about what is going on, who will come to the unknown location?
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
If we have come here, we don't have a verness.
The leaders of TFF have been held hostage and they are running as they want.
If we had a strong leadership in charge of the interest of soccer in Tanzania, we should hear that we heard about it now.
We were focused on talking, writing the success of Tanzanian soccer, but it is not right, everyday is just a problem!

While the leadership of Jamal Malinzi led to a trap, the problems are continued to increase.
Whenever it ends one month to another month, the problems are confronted as months.
They rarely ses without any problem inside our football.

What is trying is to be said that leaders themselves have been keen to meet with stakeholders to deal with challenges, instead the leaders have been hiding in their offices being beaten by "AC."
Although the advice should not be treated, but the stakeholders are required to be heard.
I do not believe that we can make one house then let us wait for them.
I didn't believe it.

Forget about all the previous problems in the past, the issue of Simba and Kagera Sugar clubs scrambling for three points is something that makes the headlines for soccer, though yesterday the issue was expected to be released.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
This issue has been heavy and made up to the people of different soccer institutions to intervene and others showers up to the fingers.
But the size of this issue has been led by TFF and its committees which have been unable to manage within their regulations and instead the issue moving to the will of private individuals.

The regulations of the Tanzania Premier League (TPLB) are very clear if it will be known as a player has played three yellow cards in the past games are not allowed to play the following game and playing his punishment is known.
And if a player did not have a card basically there is no case that can make people more careful to share it all the time.

The report of the referee is the last decision to believe in every different event and the ethics of the soccer game must be reached within the report.
It is said that in that report of the referee shows Kagera Sugar player, Mohamed Fakhi, got a card in his team's game against African Lyon, but the player himself has opposed that he was not given a card that day.

"But I'm not Going to do it.
The confusion of the 72-hour committee by the committee of law and dignity of players about that issue is from where the referee is unable to be heard?
A shame that is in our football were called up to African Lyon that was played by Kagera Sugar, went to be satisfied with the evidence.
If we do not want to trust the report of the referee we will believe the report of someone else?
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
The rally together, Fakhi, African Lyon and bringing in front of the referees is to look for evidence of violence that cannot give you the right answers to the report of the concerned game.
TFF and his committee had to comment on this issue by using only reports so that everyone is getting in the development of building the Tanzanian football.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
It is only Tanzania where you can meet with this situation and those of Tanzania are not aware of it.
But despite this situation, it is now time for TFF and its committee to review some of its regulations and to leave the team to win the table.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
It makes the flavor of soccer to the team that gave everything that we have for the purpose of winning the match on the field and later they have denied the victory.
TFF and his committees are not doing well the regulations of the team that will make acts of this way to meet the fine, but the winning team should stay with their victory.

In this, the members of Simba and their fans have been priority to say even the youth squad "Serengeti Boys" is going to Gabon for the table, but those people were supposed to know the appeal of TFF to the youth team to the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and Simba's appeal to TFF and its committees are two different appeal.
These are two different appeal.

The Congolese national team of Congo DR, broke the taboo for making a player with a big age "bold."
And the punishment for this way are open to CAF that is why we did not feel the noise from the Congolese fans, they knew they have done an offense and they need the punishment for removal.
But the part of Simba is the issues of torture only, but not Kagera Sugar denied their victory.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
The issue of Simba, Kagera Sugar needs wisdom of what was written by the referees of Kagera Sugar and African Lyon.
All the other we see, we will be fool.
It doesn't matter whether a player was given a card or not given.
It doesn't matter if the referee wrote a player he got a card or didn't get.
We need to trust the referees reports.
If we do not believe their reports will help.
