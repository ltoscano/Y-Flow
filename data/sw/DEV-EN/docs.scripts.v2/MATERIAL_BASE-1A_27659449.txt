"The child becomes poor development in schools, absenteeism and stop schools, in terms of adults, poor production in the office, agriculture and livestock, entrepreneurship and others," he said.
He said that a person with that problem has a big possibility of getting diseases, children suffering from time and so much more likely to get non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer and heart diseases.
He said that human life depends more about what happened in the first 1,000 days of his life.
"1,000 days since the making of abortion until a child is attaining two years, it is an important period because it is in this period the child is growing very fast and he has great needs of the implants," he said.
He said the destruction that will be caused by it will cost in that period of two years, it will not be scared in the whole period of his life, thus making a whole man in growth.
