Lwandamina said in his philosophy that he will not be surprised by him and he was using his predecessor, Hans Pluijm but he would be keen in a lot of passport and short.
Lwandamina who is expecting to start his task officially tomorrow Monday, he said that he is expecting to increase the success since he and Pluijm their philosophy has not been very different.
"I would like my team to play with the ball, I don't want the ball to sit with the opponents and the only way to stop the opponents who don't take the ball is to play a lot of time as we can, therefore, and I am a believer of soccer for a lot of passport," said Lwandamina.
Also, Lwandamina said that he has seen Yanga in his final match of the first round of the Tanzania Mainland Premier League played by Ruvu Shooting and he has found it is a good team that did not require a new player, because the players are well technical but he is expecting to give it more serious.
"Zambia's players are playing for more strength, here I see no power but technical are good, technical, confusing and strength is very good, so I have added a great team," said Lwandamina praised Pluijm that he has done a good job and promised to follow his footsteps in collaboration with him to ensure Yanga gets more success.
"The aim is to ensure that Yanga becomes more threat and it will succeed more maybe even to play the finals of the African Champions League," said Lwandamina who has been released from Zesco United of Zambia.
