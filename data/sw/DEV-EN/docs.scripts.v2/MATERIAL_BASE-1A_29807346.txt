In a speech that was read on his behalf by the head of Ngorongoro District, Rashid Mtaka at the fourth meeting of the stakeholders of the Tanzania Commission of Standards that is taking place here, Gambo said the country is facing a big disaster of the circulation of poor and poor quality products and to a large extent that contributes to poverty to its citizens.
He said that it should be controlled by all the strength to the stakeholders of those sectors together with the citizens by exposing those involved, and TBS and other stakeholders, they should partner with the state and assets to deal with that situation so that Tanzania should not be DAO of non-quality products.
Together with calling for TBS and other stakeholders, Gambo urged the citizens to boycott poor and poor products, because it is the only way to kill the market of those products.
