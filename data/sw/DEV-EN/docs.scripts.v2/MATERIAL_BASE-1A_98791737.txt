Jokingly: I don't remember Mwita Chacha on the men of Dar es Salaam, they don't have anything they are going to Gym in order to arrest the beauties, because they have been unable to control the Road and run on the road while others have put them on the top of the bar.
Now Mtunisy is one of the youths who won the Gym has emerged with this letter.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"This letter goes to you, Mister Mwita Chacha, I don't know from Tarime that brought the record and tell us the men of Dar es Salaam to be a lot of cowards and we are afraid to even use it.
In your information, we the men of Dar are not cowards like you have called us and we are the same day not like we were running the road but we were running for fear for a lot of people who were in the bar because in the violence, if any one may have happened so much even if we have a lot of weapons that you get in the bar as if you are looking at the road and machetes you think that you are in the road and end up with your wife in Dar in just three months if you look like we are looking for us when we have a lot of weapons in which if you don't know if we are in the road and I don't know if we are a lot of weapons when you look at you even if you don't know if we are in the road and I don't know if we are a lot of weapons when you look at you even if you don't know if we are in the road and I don't know if we are a lot of weapons when you look at you even if you are just like that, I request you to send this message to the guys.
