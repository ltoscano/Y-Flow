President of the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF), Jamal Malinzi, has all the rights of having friendship with someone and support him in any good thing.
So that the project doesn't use the laws of the country, Malinzi can go anywhere he wants, to meet anyone who wants to speak to anyone.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
But there is a big difference, the biggest difference between Jamal Malinzi, as a private person and Jamal Malinzi as the president of TFF.
In Swahili language, we say the difference is like between heaven and land.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
I will give a few examples.
Jamal Malinzi can go to the pitch and celebrated a goal when his team Yanga plays.
But, as the president of TFF, he is supposed to show that he will not trust him even if he has personal love.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
As a private person, Malinzi can go to a meeting of clubs while wearing a shirt of the club he loves but as the president of TFF, there is a level that he cannot cross in showing his love.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Whenever he did, he is supposed to put the first interests of his institution first before his personal interests.
When it comes to the time of choosing between an issue with its benefit and with the benefit of TFF, the president of TFF is supposed to choose the one with the benefit of the institution.

'It's a lot of things but with a great impact, very great.
That is why, I was surprised by his step of visiting the retired prime minister the day before yesterday and asked him about the strategy of the federation.

The big question that is being asked here is why Malinzi went to explain the plans and strategies of TFF to Lowassa.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Lowassa is not the minister of the Ministry of Information and Sports which at least is working closely with that federation.
If Lowassa would be the minister of that ministry, I could understand the aim of Malinzi to go.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Unfortunately, I have not heard if Malinzi has been to the minister of that ministry, Doctor.
Fenella Mukangara, explaining to him about the strategies that he has explained to Lowassa.
The question is going on, why Malinzi went to a person who TFF does not work with him directly?
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
I would understand a bit of Malinzi as Lowassa would be the chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Social Development which is involved in sports issues.
But Lowassa is the chairperson of the parliamentary committee of foreign affairs which in fact has no direct connection with TFF.
"But I'm not Going to do it.

If Lowassa would be a member of the National Sports Council (BMT), I could understand the aim of the tour of Malinzi.
But unfortunately, Lowassa has never been a member of that council.

I say that I would have understood if Malinzi would have gone to meet with President Jakaya Kikwete, because his government is paying the salary of the coach of the national team (Taifa Stars).
But Lowassa is a member of parliament and not in government for now.

If Malinzi has had a problem to meet with the retired prime minister, he is known for loving soccer.
Called Frederick Tluway Sumaye and not Edward Lowassa.
If he had met with Sumaye telling him about his plans to lift soccer, at least I could not understand.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
That is why I wonder, Malinzi was followed by Lowassa?
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Edward Ngoyai Lowassa who I know I have never seen him in any big soccer match here in the country for a long time now.
Basically, when you talk about the names of politicians who like soccer game, the name of Lowassa is not mentioned.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
We see the politicians who come to the National Stadium during the big and small matches of football.
Professor Juma Kapuya usually comes to the field.
Samuel Sitta is not that he is attending a poem, but he is also one of the sponsors of the Simba Club.
I have also seen them in the field, often, Freeman Mbowe and Zitto Kabwe.
They like the ball.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Amos Makalla is coming to the field.
Mussa Azan Zungu is attending the match.
Iddi Azzan is attending the match.
Richard Ndassa is attending the match.
Juma Next is attending the match.
I have seen many times Mwigulu Nchemba attending a match at the National Stadium where the big match will be played.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
I am not sure if Lowassa has been entering the stadium to watch the match even one of the soccer.
It is inside my right to say that Lowassa is not a football person.
It wouldn't be that, all of us would know because the era of football is not something to hide.
That is why, together with holding the highest position in this country, every one who is following soccer knows that Kikwete loves Yanga club.

On the sidelines of Football, there is no secret.
