Compared to last year
December since the ninth of December to December
Because we use the system of using the dollar because the dollar is the money that is going on, you use the dollar if you look for it that had six hundred thousand.
Six hundred thousand shillings last year, a person can get through a total of nine hundred thousand dollars which is the same as three hundred and seven hundred thousand dollars in the floor on one of the current rate you are getting three hundred and five hundred dollars, thus already from December until today at the center you lost the dollar, the bride is the one to pay for money.
Because of the Tanzanian money when you look at a person you finished the farming and harvesting, you find it the same money that has not increased there.
If you look at this anywhere.
You can't have big ministers.
Even if the government itself
In Israel, there is still a bed and planting in a banner like ours now, it has risen so much as a businessman there had bought your things to the dollar and then now you don't sell you on the same price because it was paid a five hundred thousand.
Tanzanians below
In December they were eight hundred and twenty thousand shillings but now it is paid nine hundred thousand shillings and rearing we see how those things affect many people.
We Tanzanians do not have our industries
There is no thing we are selling outside but instead the small dollar that is available while in the town is bought and we are without any way and we can sell outside we have a lot of industries that do not have a reason to go to bring things so that such things are doing.
This money, I'm sorry.
Mi on my side are we Tanzanians deserve to think more.
