"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
How do I get there, greet the stakeholders.
Before continuing to write what I intended to apologise to the girl who introduced himself by the name of Mercy on her.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
According to Mercy, his lover has given birth to his mother (mother of that girl).
Mercy also has the pregnancy of the boy.
The mother of Mercy has admitted that he has pregnant he was given by "her in-law."
It is not normal in our community but that's the real situation, the guys "chewing up" mother and child.
What happened to Mercy confirms that, the one that you love and believe him is the one who is able to thank him, to hurt and even destroy it.
After that, I congratulate the parents of the child Rashed Al- Hajjawi (10) of Palestine by recognizing the talent of that child and develop it.
I congratulate you because it is not many parents especially Tanzania who are doing efforts to recognize their children's talents, and some are aware but there is no effort to promote them.
The child Rashed has the talent of playing soccer to an amount of being given the name of Messi of Palestine.
That child has been born in Norway in the year 2006.
Lionel Messi is a soccer player of Argentina, and he has been the best player of the world five times.
For what they saw the video showing the talent of Rashed without doubt that they have accepted the ability of that child to play soccer an amount of compared to Messi.
In that video, Rashed was playing soccer with his colleagues, but nobody was able to block him.
He adds that how she wants, he has a great ability to own the ball, attacking, he is playing and annoying, and the great ability to follow the goal.
Juventus club has discovered the talent of that child and has already signed, so after several years he will start doing his in Seria A in Italy.
Perhaps there are Tanzanian children with different talents but it is sad that parents including youths do not have a culture of mentioning and developing.
Children's talent is a treasure to them and if they are continued to use them in the coming years to get the money that happened to Messi, they are coming from Christiano Ronaldo, Marta Vieira da Silva, scientist Usain Bolt, basketball player (retired) Michael Jordan and musician Janeth Jackson.
The good Day.
