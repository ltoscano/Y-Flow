"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Soccer is a game with many fans, especially youths of different ages.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
It is an indisputable fact that the soccer game has had many fans in the world including the fans of Tanzania who are ready for anything including having gone into money for the reason of getting the game.
There is no sin to love sports, but there is a need to put boundaries between encouraging sports and to do the work of bringing development to themselves economically.
Because of the sidelines, they're in business where fans have been blogging the results of the popular game like "Tibetan" and they are willing to use all the money they have in order for the participants.
Just like this issue to me, it will end up until today I decided to talk about it, it is also as seen as the government that seems to lose the power of the youth who some of them have decided to focus on gambling instead of performing or involved in using the funds they get in betting.
The Deputy Minister, Office of the Prime Minister who deals with labor, employment and youth, Antony Mavunde recently explained his disappointment with the behavior of young people who are using a lot of time to specify the results of sports and using a lot of money for a luxury.
Mavunde has urged the youth not to lose time to play that gambling and instead they use the money to specify the results in development issues.
I join the Mavunde of that, it is not a secret I don't understand the youth or people who do not forget and playing that gambling and lost money that they would have used to do the meaning of development and uplifting the economy.
I mean someone is working again to be enough or the suffering gets a bit of wages, the same time he uses to go to a gambling that has no guarantee of getting, the results from the apa, money has lost and he won't win again.
Again, others are following the punishment or want to show them to their colleagues that they have them when they are sleeping is a problem, he doesn't know what he does or what he does.
When a young man left these things, do things for development.
There are places where you know they are young and even the adults found to go and go to Tibetan, you are now talking about non-meaning, until you wonder if these family members and if they have a loss.
A whole father or a young man from home is saying you are going to work, and at work they are going to get money for gambling!
It's not good enough, you must be knowledge, mind and knowledge, this life is not to play and lose money.
You can say it is your work, your money and your decision, if you are okay and if you are traumatised by your problem, but if your life itself is to support you and you have a family, then you get money going to play for a gambling, there will be no one who will carry your problem.
The Deputy Minister Mavunde has reminded me, and I open a knowledge, you must have goals in life, remember those who refereed that games, they are doing business, themselves they are losing, you are losing, because the gambling is not a guess.
I don't have no dispute with someone who works and get enough money for himself or to fulfill his personal needs and for his family, then he has extra money to play for a gambling habit, but if he has no additional money then he makes his money in that style then I apologise to you.
Young people grow, work with the aim of self-raising and bringing development to them in good things that will bring benefits to the private and the community surrounding them.
The luxury is at the end and its end sometimes is not good.
Work for you.
