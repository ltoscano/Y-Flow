The report that between January and August this year have occurred 6,971 accidents and lost the lives of 2,217 people and others being left injured and they said they should be taken seriously.

We agree with the statement of the deputy minister of internal affairs of the country, Hamad Yussuf Masauni when he woke up when he launched the road safety week yesterday in Geita province that it is good for road safety to be a national agenda.
We are saying any good action that will help our nation to come out in this case that allows the safety and life of our people to be supported by one statement and every one who is happy our nation.
Masauni, in his speech instructed the Tanzania Roads Agency (TANROADS) to remove the penalties on the main road that has said they have been seen as part of the sources of road accidents.
The ability to remove the roads of the road, we have and if we see that it brings us more dangerous instead of the initial aim of reducing the speed of buses and other vehicles that are on the road especially in dangerous areas and ferry security forces, then we should lose to pave way for the risk that faces.
Also, the call that was given by the deputy minister of requesting all the road users to follow the law and road regulations with the keenness that you have, you have to be considered by each one of us.
Those regulations include to stop using high speed, crossing the ferry of pedestrians and cyclists and children crossing the road while under control.
But the report that was given in that event yesterday by the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communication, who is also the deputy chairperson of the National Council for Road Safety, Edwin Ngonyani, that human offenses contribute to 80 percent of accidents and following up to speed that also contributes to 12 percent of the accidents, it should be done.
What is the human mistake that we cannot work on deliberately with the aim of controlling in order to save our people's lives?
Why are the reasons for the humanitarian mistakes we should be required, including being taken to the media to find what they have to do with the relevant crime?
We still believe that the phrase of evacuation is that 'the union is strong and separation is a weakness' still benefit in dealing with the disaster, in solidarity with those who cause humanitarian crimes and continue to lose the lives of our people and make their own lives.
The passengers involved, the police of road safety and the government in general, we tried to act, we will be able to win the tragedy of the accident and the ability we have.
We should not accept to release a few people who are intentionally without caring about the law and regulations to continue being finished.
We should not accept the manifesto.
