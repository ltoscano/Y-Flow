Is Yanga doing to kill where Emmanuel Okwi?
Do they do it?

While the premier league starts, the oldest player, Ugandan, Emmanuel Okwi has been one of the most useful viewers.
Did Yanga have gone to 'a enge' in his registration?.
This could be a question that his answers are clear.
First, Okwi is the Etoile du Salehe, the Tunisian player who bought him from Simba team.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Why is Yanga?.
He was playing for SC Villa of their home in Uganda for a loan agreement of six months from Etoile.
Narre again, he was playing for Villa on loan.
FIFA allowed Okwi to play in Villa for a while in three cases that allows the Ugandan to be impressed with you.
Okwi on his side claims that the Tunisians broke the contract by failing to pay his money as it is needed.
Simba also demand their payment from Etoile.

Okwi was allowed to play for Villa in order to protect his level, and he was not a player he will face with that team.
He was blocked to play for the national team of Uganda in the ongoing African Nations tournament for the players of the internal league, CHAN, because he was Villa on loan from overseas teams.
Though, it is Villa that is the ones who are said to sell Okwi for Yanga team.
With what authority?.
Up here, Yanga will have been arrested.
Because Okwi is the Etoile player is not Villa.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Yanga have signed Okwi claiming that they are right.
They believe Okwi is a free player or the Villa.
Though, he was supposed to play in Villa for six months, but he spent less than two months and was bought.
CAF, Confederation of African Football have arrested Okwi to play for Yanga.
The committee of law and status of the players has blocked its use until when they get a clarification from FIFA, the Federation of soccer in the world.
Yes, they are right because FIFA, yes, who said that player will play the Villa for six months while his cases were dealing with.
"But I'm not Going to do it.

FIFA, they can allow Okwi to play for Yanga for his talent.
Though, they can also block him if they know that this player has violated their previous instructions which they told him to eze Villa.
It is possible that the player was seen taped, by punching Yanga when knowing that his contract is in Etoile.
There are players who won the war like Okwi, but there are also those who joined the FIFA rubble.

Perhaps Yanga has accused Okwi using Okwi on the front days, but for now it is the validity of that player.
If, Etoile will continue to hold their stand that they don't know their player wherever he is, Okwi will face it.
If Okwi will be seen as legitimate claims he can be paid by Etoile, but the trouble is where Villa got a permit to sell Okwi for Yanga team?

Each other side has its lawyers.
Oh!.
But Okwi's lawyer can be a little more, with a lot of mind, by being able to get signed by Yanga's radio for his explanation while campaigning for his client that he does not have a problem.
If the law was put to end, and if the contracts all the days can improve, Yanga will use Okwi, but we should not be surprised by FIFA, saying that the player's assets of Etoile.
Yanga bought where Emmanuel Okwi?
Maybe here is a basic argument.
