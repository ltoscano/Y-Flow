"But I'm not Going to do it.
In many areas of the country there have been a long cry for some of the citizens missing land for agriculture, rearing and construction of residential houses while in the areas surrounding them, there are few citizens who have divided the big areas where many of them have turned into a lot of destruction as a result of not being continued.

That cry has now been heard because the fifth term government has started to take action if they have made those people from not developing, instead, to give them a commitment to develop including being given farmers for the purpose of agricultural activities.
If that is not enough, the day before yesterday, the Minister of Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development, William Lukuvi noted the government's strategy to capture more people who come to the areas without developing where from July next year, to put up strict ownership laws and owners of those land will be charged high taxes.
We are increasing the government's decision because the situation has been bad, the rich are owning a big land without developing the while they are surrounded by citizens in those areas they do not have areas to grow and build houses.
They are using that opportunity and turning the Tanzania to be "Mabana and watchers," since the areas they use to leasing the farmers for the purpose of agriculture only without making them become land owners.
Others have gone far, they own land not to develop and use it for the purpose of getting loans to the bank, loans which are not going on the land to be for agriculture, rearing or even building industries when the land could be used for production of property and the country to get income and people to get employment.
We have also witnessed that there are owners who own more than five plots that were sitting for many years without caring about the presence of the law that wants to be advanced within three years.
Those plots are using it as a business where they have a monopoly for more than five years, later on selling them at high prices while the government divided and selling them so that citizens get rid of the residential problem.
As a result of that situation in the new areas like Gezaulole, Kisota, Tuangoma, Mbweni, Bunju, Dar es Salaam to today, since the grounds that will be held in 2003, have not been continued and turning into a string of criminals.
There are other areas like Gezaulole and Mabulla since the grounds are given to the citizens for three years there is no sign of starting the construction.
That situation has also seen Mbezi Beach where it is more than 30 years since the grounds are given to the citizens but it is still a prayer.
While people are suffering from a high price, there are many Tanzanians with money to build houses, they don't have land to build, therefore the aim of the government to reduce the residential problem continues to knock down.
We ask the government through the Minister of Lands, Lukuvi, to address this issue of those who have land without developing and ensuring the law is bites by being done in areas without caring for the position of the owner in the community.
We are saying that, because there are rumors that there are two government officials and even the business people have big areas and they have not advanced while poor citizens, getting problems in the construction of residential areas, agriculture and rearing.
The act of people count on land while others don't even have a small piece of food, it is causing hatred.
That situation was left to continue being the same as making a bomb that came to end many, the ones that are not there.
It is good to take a caution early before the danger occurred.
The current law requires people to develop land for construction within three years, to work with actions, the government should not put on the land and the law to charge huge taxes to the owners of those areas, which will start being used to work every area.
