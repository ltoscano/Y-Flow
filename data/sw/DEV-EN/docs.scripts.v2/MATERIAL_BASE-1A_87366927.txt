"I urge all citizens that we are developing the operation in searching for suspects of different crimes including those doing business houses to sleep foreigners contrary to the law by running a bathroom," he said.
He has said in his report that the investigation has revealed that there have been houses of sleeping guests that are running a business rary by protecting criminals, including women and men who are selling their bodies (sister and good brother).
"It is the responsibility of the police to conduct an inspection from time in the house of visitors, hotels, restaurants, clubs, alcoholics and luxury spots," he said and added that those found will be taken against them.
Sirro has urged the business people of sleeping houses to follow the procedures of receiving visitors by writing their names in books, writing the numbers of their identity cards and the places they get and when they give them any client to give information to any police station.
