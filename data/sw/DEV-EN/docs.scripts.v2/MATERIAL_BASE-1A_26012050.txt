The aim is explained to enable an investor to move the community services closer to the citizens, including primary and secondary schools.
He said, "for now the area is being attacked by citizens and that situation can cause an investor to give up."
It is stated that the investor has shown good intentions to build houses for teachers and servants in the health sector, therefore it is good that the area is measured by having documents.
He said that yesterday after Gambo visited the clinic area and saw the real situation of infrastructure, including the way the investor has sacrificed for the purpose of helping the hospital services together with the construction of houses for teachers and modern nurses.
He said that in that health center, he is expecting to bring a machine to shine and that the existing challenges are lack of electricity.
He asked Gambo to help them so that the electricity will go to that center and eventually the citizens can benefit from investors because some of the tourists are at the center to see how citizens get treatment.
On his part, Gambo congratulated Chambulo in helping the community as an investor in tourism and ordered the lands officer of Longido district together with his fellow experts to arrive at the area on Monday so that they were ime.
Moreover, he wanted the manager of Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) Arusha Region, Gaspa Msigwa to make sure he takes electricity in that area.
