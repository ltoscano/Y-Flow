The special assembly of the constitution is in its seventh week out of 10 that was given earlier, and it is this week that has been involved in the official opening of the draft constitution; an important document and the only one that brought to the members of that parliament, to use them to write a new constitution.

The days that are remaining for the purpose of discussing the document is very few than used in making regulations that will lead the discussion of the historic parliament, and even if they will be added 20, according to the law, it may not be completed to complete the hard work.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
It is not our intention to criticize the regulations of leading the delegates, because we know the importance of the existence of strong regulations; even if there are those that have already been broken before even it will not start being used and we do not want to say that the long time is not enough.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
We believe that it is more important in this period of discussing the draft, it is for delegates to consider the views of citizens; that is what the citizens want to be in their constitution, for their benefit in daily life and future generations.

We are not the first to give this call and we will not be the last to do so, but we have to continue asking the delegates to consider the opinion of the citizens because in many debates that was witnessed from Dodoma, many delegates seem to be pushed by the views and opinions of their parties.

Examples are many, but big and clear are the one to decide the type of vote that is not used in passing the sections of the draft constitution, the small issue but distributed the delegates in the political party regardless of what the citizens wanted from them.

Even when the regulations were unprecedented on who between the president and the chairperson of the Constitutional Review Commission should be the first to address the parliament; political ideology and the attitude of the constitution should be the first to address the parliament; political ideology and the attitude of the constitution is ruling even if ordinary citizens are not great.

And now there are every signs of existence of pressure from outside the parliament after the leaders of the political parties that are outside Dodoma started a journey to visit the whole country to encourage citizens to support the system of the union that is required by the concerned party.

So, what does this mean?
How will these tours help the Parliament of the constitution?
What is the government's position in this?
Is the parliament doesn't have the ability to restrictions and command not to be left immediately for these ridiculous tours can be devastated by violence among the people of Tanzania.

We know and many know that the time to comment on the changes of the constitution was given and it has been completed.
For now, it is the shifts of delegates of the Constitutional Assembly to discuss in Dodoma; when they finish those, that is when it comes to the shifts of citizens voting for the draft that will be made in Dodoma.

Now the "mere" will be taken to the public at this time when their opinions cannot be brought to the draft in Dodoma is why if it is not free to make sure that the only work for them is to vote for the referendum?

That is why we would like to see the delegates discussed the draft without pressure from the outside of Dodoma nor their parties, but by considering the opinions of the citizens and especially the content in the documents they will use during this debate; among these documents being the draft, the following of the draft constitution, the constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania and that of Zanzibar.
