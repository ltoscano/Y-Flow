Many areas of Dar es Salaam for now is not safe to live.
It is not safe because criminal acts conducted by various criminal groups are growing significantly.
The week does not live without hearing incidents of robbery in the areas of Dar es Salaam.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Those actions have done people to live in fear because there is no incident that the police have tried to catch up or even stop it before.
Apart from that robbery using fire weapons, but there are also groups driven by mouse Road, Wolves and Black Americans and many others have been a big threat to the residents of Dar es Salaam as a result of doing criminal acts without even having any fear against the state agencies.
Since May this year, these groups use traditional weapons like gays, machetes and knives have been a big threat in the areas of the outskirts of Dar es Salaam and despite the looting, they have also attacked people who are attacked by swords and knives.
An example of the day before yesterday in Mbagala, it was reported that one of those groups made a Little one of the officers of the Defence Force (TPDF), Jerald Malilo who got serious injuries in the head and forced to be admitted at Lugalo Army Hospital.
Malilo was injured while entertaining at work during the morning, despite the soldier but also many citizens have already discovered that one way of getting income is to make the people who have ever worked early in the morning.
The day before yesterday in Dar es Salaam, such groups stormed people's homes and killed two people and made looting.
Such events when police arrive in these areas have already been killed or injured badly and looting have been done.
But there are other groups that are running the looting at night in different areas.
These have been stormed even in bars for the project to get anything to believe that people who go to bars are those who have money.
There are also other groups doing their crime at night, they feel that most of them wear people's homes.
They are searching for homeless people may be interested in getting any amount of money, mobile phones, non-cell phones and laptop computers.
These youth groups have already confessed because they are doing looting or invading people's homes, the behavior of the people of Dar es Salaam for fear of giving support they have contributed to the groups to be good.
But also the lack of security including one of the community police in many areas have encouraged those youths to do their crime for more freedom.
Many areas of the city of Dar es Salaam have no police stations and for example residents of Dar claim that the police service is available at the Stuari station which is far from that area.
My advice is that the area like Kitunda, which has more than two wards, that is Kitunda Ward in Dar es Salaam and Msepwa is good for the police to be in custody for 24 hours than it is now in Kitunda Ward being supported at 4 o'clock in the evening.
This is dangerous and provides an opportunity for these groups to do their crime for more freedom.
Even other areas outside the city like Mbweni and it does not have a police station depending on the idea, something that is very dangerous.
In the previous years, the community seemed to help a lot in strengthening defense.
The chairmanship will be present at that time, Said Mwema, by recognizing the least the police seemed to afford that area and the crime has significantly reduced.
But the departure of IGP Mwema should be like he left with participatory security.
I suggest that controlling these criminal groups must be a stable security.
The police are interested in participatory security in our neighborhoods so as to get people to cooperate with the police in making security of citizens.
