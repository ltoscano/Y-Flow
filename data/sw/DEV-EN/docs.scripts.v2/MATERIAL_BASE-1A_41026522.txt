The meeting about Syria that is known as Geneva II yesterday came into the second day in Switzerland, after a heated speech by attacking rivals during the opening of the meeting the day before yesterday, and especially about the fate of President Bashar Al-Assad.
Syrian officials said that the leader will not leave power, insisting that it should be noted that it should be dealing with terrorism in that nation.
According to DW, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of America, John Kerry, joined the opposition to insist on the formation of the transition government without President Assad.
On the other hand, the mediator of the United Nations, Lakhdar Brahimi said they have received a sign that the concerned sides are ready to talk about issues of opening the way for aid to reach those who need them, release prisoners and stopping the fights.
At the same time, the United Nations has said more than 100,000 people have been killed because of the clashes with millions.
