"Your seeds is mature today, mine will be mature tomorrow.
It is a good thing for us all of us if I will not grow up with you today, and you help to grow tomorrow.
I can't have friendship with you as I see that you have not build a friendship with me.
The season will be called, we should not be trust and cooperate, then we are all going to lose losses. "
(Philosopher David Hume) Kuna while traveling to Finland.
There he was very surprised to see a lot of tractors have been placed on one farm.
I asked my host; where?
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
I felt that it is a culture of farmers in that country.
Every year I have a farming competition for sectors.
The farmers of one area may be in their colleague's farm and made those competitions; they are looking for who has been above his colleagues in making the lyrics, growing rapidly, and so on.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Only in Finland, I understood, that the culture started since the era of hydrogen.
The tractors were in farming, it happened to one farmer, prompting his colleague; "do your tractor is the same as the strength of many horses?
It is in that environment, even the measure of horses will begin to be used; horse Power, it means the horse is used even today in testing the energy of various machines.

I will speak about the importance of social capital (Social Capital) and civil society (Civil courage) so as to uplift the economy of one person and eventually lift the economy of the country.
For the society and the country in general, it needs to have this important capital.
The growth of social cooperation in various activities, be sad or celebration, it is an example of the existence of a good foundation of social capital.
"But I'm not Going to do it.

This concept of social and social capital may be new to some of us.
However, it is something that we witnessing every day.
We see different social groups increasing.
Today we have examples of the communities that are denied, we have the communities of lending and many others.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Let us take this example of the community with cooperation in celebration, for instance, wedding.
In the meantime, entertainment spots is no surprise you meet with people who are in the session of the organizing committee of the wedding.
It is these committees with planning to make a wedding.
Sometimes regarded even what is called a "wedding day!."
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
The wedding committee will meet even twice a month.
And often they meet for luxury spots after hours of work.
The committee will air strategies to make the wedding as other members of the committee without beer.
And even when they make a wedding, they will meet again as a special committee for "breaking" the committee.
They will quickly eat, they will fill it.
A Fungu of doing that is also planned in the wedding budget!

While our colleagues in Finland are competing in development activities, we, together with our poverty, we are still competing in doing a great luxury.
We use millions of shillings to do the wedding of "dying people" while there are people who died in poverty.
They are dying because the road from their villages up to the districts of the districts are not used!
There are people who die for lack of money to buy drugs for their diseases.

Let you recognize it closely this concept of social and social capital by checking the writings of Professor Robert Putnam in his book; Making Democracy Work (make Democracy work).
Professor Putnam, an American, gave his book in 1993.
He and his colleagues did research by checking two areas of Italy; north and south.
This was 70 years old.
The two parts of Italy have been with the economic development that is different from this today.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Italy's Southern is poor, compared to Italy in northern Italy.
Professor Putnam through the study notes, that this is coming from Italy in South Africa missing what Italy has an issue.
The people of Italy in the north for many years have had a culture of joining together in different communities of the things that they like; there are a community of choir members, communities of fishermen, the communities of going to watch the plane.
There is also a community or different sports clubs.
In general, there are many communities of people from their privilege.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
But the primary thing he saw Professor Putnam is the fact that participants in these communities are out of checking their personal interests and the community.
It begins to look at the interests of the whole community in the meaning of the nation.
This is when it comes to the concept of civil society.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
The civil society is the state of a person to discover themselves as a citizen in the country, and that if a citizen has a responsibility to put the interests of the country he was born and registered his citizenship.
He has a responsibility to participate in building his country.
The capital of social, civil society and trust is three radical things that according to Professor Putnam, have fun to grow to the economy of the region or the concerned country.

Professor Putnam and his colleagues are revealing that Italy in South Africa has maintained its development because of its people to look more than personal interests and those of the families around them.
It is in South Italy where until today we heard there are groups of fund as the famous Mafia district.

When we get rid of scientific explanations and professionals more than this Professor, let's look at the situation in our country.
Indeed, this social capital is established in our society, Tanzania as a country can make steps of development.
We look like these wedding committees and the burial sites that are planning and using millions of shillings for the "wedding of people" and preparing a burial, perhaps for "people to come!" They would put the power too in looking for family activities.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
That for the same procedure they would have formed an infrastructure committee for our streets.
They should have been making strategies to ensure that money is driven by people are encouraged to make holes on the local roads, with dirty water that is being raised.
That should be the "dying person."
Locks, neighborhoods, districts and provinces by involving citizens competing for such activities of construction of the nation.

Let it reach a place also, those who have put the selfish feel better in the community.
They are not given the qualifications to put their selfishness and even by sabotage the public property.
Today in our country, the leader is proud to drop in the public car and allow the driver to continue to fly the vehicle engines until he came back to the big work.
The car can stand up with the engines being sent even for the whole hour!
Destroy the oil and tax of citizens.
That big one when he is with his driver in his private car, she's turned out when the driver is unable to shut down the engines while he has gone down to make the purchase at the store.
Then he will see the pain of the fuel that is planned for free.
He thought about the cost of fuel with his pocket.
But with a public car, he does not see the pain of the oil, he destroys the government!
That is where the lack of civilian casualties.
Lack of patriotism.
It is examples of the actions that are entertaining behind development.
This debate will continue.
