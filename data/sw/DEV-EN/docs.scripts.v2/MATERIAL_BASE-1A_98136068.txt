Parents to fight in front of children is misconduct, although every community has its culture, I believe in every community there are no parents who see many people pick up and even reach throwing the fields in front of their children.
Even if the parents are angry how it is not a civilization to start a slew, while making a lot of words in front of young children.
It is possible today to see that it is a big problem, but any child who has lived as witnessing parents are fighting for a certain way in the growth of her child.
The worst thing is that when even children with their marriages are found to feel fighting is normal culture, because they have lived seeing their mother being beaten and locked out of the house or the kitchen.
These actions have also done some of the girls to hate their father and see them are innocent people.
