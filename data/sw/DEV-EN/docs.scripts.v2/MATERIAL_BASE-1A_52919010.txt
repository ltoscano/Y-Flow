The union of youths of the Revolutionary Party (UVCCM) have said that it is a shame to the leaders that have ever been given higher bail and the government to lead the administration of the administration and fail, to start criticizing their colleagues on non-basis accusations.
Also, the union has expressed his disappointment with the claims that were released recently by the retired prime minister, Edward Lowasa, urging President John Magufuli to leave a plan to buy a plane instead he will keep the water.
The acting secretary general of UVCCM, Shaka Hamdu Shaka, gave the statement in this province yesterday when he visited the water distribution project and inspected new wells of clean and safe water that are used to distribute water in Kiniha Ward in Biharamulo district in this province.
He said it is surprising to listen to the leader and the politician especially Lowassa who once served as the minister of water and livestock later that the prime minister was unable to solve the water problem until he resigned from the Richmond scandal.
Undoubtedly he said it is not good for someone with the opposition to denounce even the good things that are done by the government.
"Lowassa is denounced and criticize because he is against President Doctor.
Magufuli, a person who wants to give a bamboo eye on your colleague's eye, he should remember him he was a minister with a bond of water, but he also failed, "insisted Shaka.
The acting secretary general of UVCCM urged the government officials and the district council to continue their partnership and to recognize that they have a bond of serving the citizens and solve the problems that they are facing.
He urged the government leaders at the concerned level to understand that there is no need to listen to accusations or criticisms that are provided by the opponents because their work is to say every day and the work of the government is to act and demonstrate in actions.
"I am happy to see the leaders in the DC office to work together and in collaboration with the district council, we all are in an effort to build a stable house, therefore there is no need for the management of the CCM manifesto of 2015-2020, the President has said that you are making your ability in actions," said Shaka.
Previously, Shaka participated in the construction and inspected the progress of the construction project of teachers and the health center that was started at Kaniha Primary School in Biharamulo district.
Undoubtedly he was accompanied by Biharamulo district commissioner, Saada Malunde, to view that project.
The head of the district said the government is doing everything possible to ensure water experts are looking for water areas that are required to get enough wells and people get clean and safe water.
DC Saada Malunde, said that there are four wells out of 12 that have been destroyed and that they have ordered the new ones at the time when they arrive in production and distribution of water will be reliable in that ward.
"We have 12 wells in Kaniha ward where four out of those have been destroyed, we are in great efforts to ensure that the problem is ending quickly," said DC Malunde.
