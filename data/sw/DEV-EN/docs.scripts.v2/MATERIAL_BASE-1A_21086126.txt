Professor Munene said that the university had the aim of being the lawyers who succeeded and those who have good work behavior as well as to respect their leaders.
The head of that college, Professor James Tutoek said that Kenya has a number of 10,000 lawyers.

Professor Tuitoek said that Egan will fill the gap in the number of lawyers.
