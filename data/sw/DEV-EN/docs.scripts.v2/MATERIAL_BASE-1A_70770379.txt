They were denied breast cancer and given higher education for this disease which has been increasing at a fast rate in the country.
The project manager of the company, Jonathan Kvitova said the commemorations have taken place so as to implement the plan of the company to strengthen the health of employees and their families known as Health First.
"The response of all our employees to participate in this program is good as many have come out to be tested and be given advice on how to avoid breast cancer and to know the symptoms of this disease early as soon as it comes, so that they have ever been tested and getting treatment," he said.
The Coordinator of the First Health Program of TBL Group, Julieth Mgani said apart from the workers being given education and advice on various diseases, they also get an opportunity to participate in a joint exercise involving their families and they have been getting educated on the importance of good nutrition.
One of the doctors that runs cancer testing to those workers in Dar es Salaam city, Doctor Walter Kweka, said Tanzania is one of the countries with a huge increase in cancer patients especially in recent years, especially breast cancer that affects many women.
