The referees of the First Division League will also be followed by the editor there has been a lot of rounds for referees that refereed the premier league matches.
The truth is that there is every reason to follow up even the lower level matches that there are things that are done and you can't lie.
I think there's every reason to start following these referees.
The First Division League is the one that gives the premier league teams, its results are going to play against the poor and going on while they are the referee for visitors, this problem of referees is not allowed in the premier league alone, even the league level.
I believe TFF and the league managers will be keen on this I say and bring change in the games.
