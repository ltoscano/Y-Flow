Yanga may have lost his striker, Amis Tambwe whose contract is heading to the day because until now there is no any talks that they did with him.

Tambwe has been behind only five months in his current contract that is expected to end at the end of this season.
Perhaps Yanga were left with no plan again and they want to leave the top scorer of the Tanzania Mainland Premier League last season and last year's season.
While Yanga last season scored 21 goals when he was with Simba in his first season in the Tanzania Mainland Premier League, scored 19 goals.
As a result of soccer laws, a player is behind a six months contract, he can have talks with other teams or even signing a previous contract, if his team the club is playing will not increase the contract.
Speaking to this newspaper yesterday, Tambwe said that for now he has not received any offer, but it happens after his contract with Yanga frame is ready.
"I still have a contract with Yanga, I have not done any talks to be given up to now, I can't say I will go, I am waiting for you, I will make it clear," he said.
The former Simba player said it is very early to decide whether he will leave the desert, believing he has a chance to continue serving the club.
Recently, the Deputy Chairperson of Yanga, Clement Sanga said that they need that player because he has a good quality, and that they will do with talks to add a new contract.
Tambwe has scored eight goals in the round of the Tanzania Mainland Premier League this season, he finished second behind Shiza Kichuya leading with nine points.
At the same time, the defender of Yanga, Vincent Bossou was expected to arrive yesterday and today to join his colleagues in the practice of that team ready for the second round of the Tanzania Mainland Premier League that is expected to start on December 17.
Bossou arriving at the number of players who reported at the training in Yanga to reach 24 since the new coach, George Lwandamina starting to train that team.
