He has instructed the district commissioner of Kibiti to start a crackdown on students' students to be taken to school so that their parents can be taken against them.
He made the instructions the day before yesterday in Kibiti when speaking to the citizens at a public rally when he was in his tour in Pwani province.
Minister Majaliwa said the fifth term government has canceled fees in primary and secondary schools as a step of uplifting the level of education and urged parents and guardians to fulfill their duties by ensuring that the children are studying and not to get married.
"DC from now started a crackdown on all children who don't go to school so that their parents are arrested and taken appropriate measures.
The government has given money so that our children should not stop and it is illegal to make the girl child, the parent is involved, we will arrest and get married and you were married to you are in prison, we have no humor on that, "he said.
Speaking about the needs of those children in school, Majaliwa said that right now the parent has reduced the burden of paying for fees and many donations which the government has given and urged parents to use those funds to ensure those children are bought, shoes, and given food so that they can get well.
"Those funds at the time I am using to pay fees and contributions will now be able to buy a draw and food for your children, it is banning the child to go to school while getting in a draw that chanted," he said.
He said parents must ensure their children are reading.
He warned parents who have a habit of marrying their children by encouraging their studies to stop immediately because from now, it is found in the studies of a student especially female students, to prepare to go to jail for 30 years.
In another step, the prime minister said three servants of the Forest Department that he stopped work to pave way for investigations they will continue to be out of work.
Also, he returned to work to the Forest Officer of the National Forest Agency (TFS) in Rufiji district for being a new servant and he will not be involved in the haphazard harvesting of forests.
However, he urged traders with licenses of harvesting logging from the council's office to inspect the validity of their licenses while waiting for a new procedure of harvesting forest crops.
