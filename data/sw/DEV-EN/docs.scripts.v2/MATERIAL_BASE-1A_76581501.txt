The union of local governments (ALAT) in Tanga province has announced the conflict with the central government claiming that some of the district commissioners have been blocking the servants, elected officials using the authority that they have to put in custody.
The chairman of ALAT in that province, fre.Sadick Kallaghe, said that the day before yesterday at the meeting of that community that took place in Muheza town, while on the resolution of their session that took place in Pangani District, September 22, 2013.
He said they are not ready to see any leader of the Central Government is blocking local government servants.
He added that the main government has distributing power to local governments as an illusion because most of the money in every year's budget that are taken to the council especially the funds for development, are coming in delay or not completely.
"The result, citizens lack faith in the leaders of the council including politicians... there is no good relationship between the central government and local government here in Tanga.
"Some of our staff are oppressed when they implement their work, it has reached a step even the councilors are placed inside but because the issue of the councilor of Mswaha Ward, Korogwe district, Tesu Kipaku is in court, we cannot speak," he said.
He said the local government is the full authority that was made legal as the executive director, chairman of the council, heads of departments, councilors and other servants.
Kallaghe who is also the chairman of Korogwe district council and the councilor of Dindira Ward, said that he is one of the people that were harassed from his district and some of the members of the parliamentary committees who visited that province in the year 2013 because some of them have their agenda "pocket."
"In the sessions of the leaders of the council and parliamentary committees, reports that are provided are not true, the member of parliament is standing and said that the council of Korogwe has got dirty documents, he asked where he got these data, my council has never got a dirty documents five years in a row," said Kallaghe.
He added that another thing that deprives local government leaders is the main government to announce to the citizens that "it has given" billions of money to the council while it is money for salaries for servants and those of development projects.
Kallaghe said that more than three months, the main government has not taken money to the council for the purpose of normal expenditure (OC), funds for development projects more than four months and those of compensation for sources which were canceled (GPG).
"Apart from these funds not being given, it is still announced that there are many funds have been taken to the council, and we are confusing the citizens," said Kallaghe.
And the local government officer in that province, Maggie Chande said the local governments don't have a lot of money as claimed by the central government, thus they are unable to implement many development projects instead of the local government servants have been called and put inside.
"The leader can lead people to disperse or gather, we must use wisdom because we don't rule the animals... I have noted that the leaders are elected at the age of this age is a problem, the old man is elected at the age of more than 35 years," said Chande.
And the Deputy Mayor of Tanga City, Mzamil Shemexit said some of the leaders are being given power where to put inside a servant, the executive of the village or the chairperson does not eliminate the problems but increase since it is cold.
