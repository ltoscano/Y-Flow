Mwalimu Nyerere once a time said that if I wanted to be a dictator, I would be able to go. Now Tanzanians have blindness and we don't see them. I have said in my post that there is a day Tanzanians will remember President Kikwete.

1.
Threats and HOW to accept or proceed to Magufuli now is feared and he is afraid of the citizens, especially workers and business people. To Adolph Hitler won the elections and did not coup the government also got public sympathy even when he did. See now this post there are people who criticize him regardless of his relevance.

The violation of the human rights right now, you can put the police without being sentenced in the day. The anny of Paul Makonda of treasurer is being detained without taking him to court is a violation of human rights. Now recently, the district commissioner is deciding only in comparing it without looking for human rights.

3... to the rule of law.
There is a violation of the law to be clear while citizens are investigating. Honorable Magufuli personally claimed that he will break a house that prevents water pipeline even km, the case is in court and then people are doing this no, there is a law of Law what does it mean?. There is also the head of the district where he is praising the doctor without following the Sheriareview process through the employer which is the director.

Consequently.
I request to look at the system of leadership and the administration of the country, than Magufuli to fire people every day, the problem is not the people is a prisoner. I have proposed a new constitution to be voted for it to start working so as to stop how it comes with threats.
Magufuli is not given a Check and balance and the main committee believe that he will be a dictator.
