Every stakeholder fulfilling his responsibility, we will end the problem of female genital mutilation, "said Luoga in that meeting which was attended by religious leaders, traditional elders and government officials who are involved in the issues of child protection.
He has said that he has ordered the police force to be in a state of caution in preventing the acts of GM and urged the citizens to give enough cooperation.
"After getting reports that the schedule is out, we have done a session and we have collaborated with the traditional elders, but also I have directed the OCD to make sure that we are preventing the female children to be stolen," said Luoga.
The Executive Director of CDF, Kremlin has used the opportunity to introduce a new project which aims to strengthen the protection of the girl child in three wards of Tarime district which are Turnbull, Bomani and Nyamisangura.
