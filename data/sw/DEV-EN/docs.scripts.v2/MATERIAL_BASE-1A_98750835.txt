The government of Dar es Salaam province has decided to educate grade four students who will go well in science subjects and elected to continue with form five and six.

For now the grade four students are continuing to do their exam to end education at that level.
The Provincial Commissioner of that province, Paul Makonda (in the picture) explained about that decision when he received a donation of 200 desks worth 20 million shillings from the Almile schools in the city.
He said his office has seen it good to start by educating those students so as to increase the number of science experts in various sectors in the country.
He said that the teachers who teach those students will be given cash to two million shillings each and to be taken to transport in the animals and the wife or the husband of the concerned teachers.
Speaking about the conflict of some of the parents of that school, Makonda urged them to use the procedures of taking the complaints that it is supposed to start from the district education officers and the province and not directly to the ministry.
Also, he advised ministers not to work on the complaints that have been taken directly to them.
The chairman of the board of the Kargument Shia Ithand Asheri relatives (KSIJ), Imagiaz Lalji, that owns those schools, said they congratulate President John Magufuli for his efforts to promote the education sector in the country.
"It was a great shame for the country with big forests to transport logging outside the country while children get on the floor of the dust in the race to look for education," he said.
