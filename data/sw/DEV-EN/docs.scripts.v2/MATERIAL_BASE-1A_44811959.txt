Some of the mental patients who were receiving treatment at Mathari Hospital concerned to provide treatment to those patients in Nairobi, Kenya, have fled to the hospital due to a strike of doctors.
Reports indicate that more than 100 patients have used the opportunity of the strike to escape to the hospital.
Doctors in the country are in the strike demanding their government to pay the cumulative increase of salaries and other stakes under the agreement that was signed in June, 2013 and the appropriate time for the year 2015 on improving the working environment.
The strike has affected all the hospitals that are run by the government in the provinces and the National Referral Hospital including the National Hospital of Kenyatta and MOI in Eldo.
Senior health officials in the government, the day before yesterday held a emergency meeting at night to prevent the strike but they did not succeed.
Health care is standing in another step, thousands of patients in public hospitals in the country are suffering without treatment due to the strike of doctors and other health workers.
Reports indicate that other patients in the public hospitals in that country have been forced to return home, to look for treatment in private centers whose cost is high.
In the year 2013, the health sector in the country took some of its services under the county authorities, that step prompted the public hospitals to be under the supervision of governors.
However, the Ministry of Health is still running the national executive hospital including Kenyatta that is in the west of Kenya.
Since the health sector is under the management of the county, the health services seem to have diminished, nurses and doctors working on strikes every time to complain about poor work environment.
The tension between the Central Government and the county about the provision of important equipment in the health centers has also increased the health sector in the country.
The ministry has been urging health workers to oma to save the lives of patients, to give them time to assess the solution but the request is seen to be ignored.
There are no reports that were given by Wiara about the treatment situation in the public hospitals where some of the governors are threatening to cancel all the jobs that will participate in the strike.
