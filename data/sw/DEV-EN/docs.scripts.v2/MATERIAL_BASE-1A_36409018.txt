This article will conclude my assessment of the 8th general meeting of CCM that took place in Dodoma since November 11th to November 14th this year.

Since the Party of Revolution (CCM) is a state of a dollar, its crush is usually lying to people and believe that every after the general meeting, CCM is always in afresh.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
This belief has been built up in the fact that, before the general meeting, there are some signs of mines and several groups of groups wanting their agenda to overcome.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Due to the control of state agencies together with the sidelines of the country, the plans are stuck and made many people believing that CCM has themselves, and those who do make it afresh every after the general meeting!

"But I'm not Going to do it.
The history of this concept is long, and the victims (victims) of this strategy in recent years is Salmin Amour (Komandoo), Mzee John Malecela, Doctor.
Gharib Bilal, Samuel Sitta and now Edward Lowassa.

In the past years, Mzee Aboud Jumbe and Sharif Hamad.
Due to clear reasons, this strategy to give the new life CCM usually affects the people of Zanzibar than they are held.

President Karume and "nonsense" as the vice chairman who is completing his term, the retired president of peace Karume was welcomed to give his advice on the day of closing the meeting.
He gave a speech, which is now called for the cooking in Magogoni and Lumumba Street.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
There is no one that expected that Karume would say the words that he said that day, the amount of chairman Jakaya Kikwete admitting that he has never seen him happy with that amount "as he saw that day.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Several times his speech was threatened by people calling for him to finish and stay.
This was reminded of the era of Benjamin Mkapa's chairperson when Kikwete netizens were calling for everyone who wanted to question the use of bribery in that meeting.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Mzee Joseph Butiku remembers this and he wrote a letter to the chairperson Mkapa.
This will remember us that the boycott has not started with CHADEMA in meetings.

When he was read to him, President Karume urged them to talk about the cries and contrasting of fish!
Some claiming, President Karume was given a lot of attention to that day.
He should have been given or thrown out; it is a bowl or not a mom; for me it is not the news.
The important news is what he said for the minutes he was given.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Karume spoke about his ASP card (Afro Shiraz Party); he explained the purpose of ASP; he asked Doctor.
Shein as he has his ASP card.
One of the purpose of ASP reminded that it is to protect the freedom of Zanzibar and its people.
Then he asked those who blocked their colleagues to give their opinions about the coalition.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
He reminded President Kikwete that he gave permission to everyone to say what he wants during the process of releasing a new constitution.
He was questioning how many others are arrested for expressing their opinions.
Karume reminded the way CCM has lost some of the states as a reason to ignore the opinion of the citizens.
He reminded me of the shifts between the member of parliament and representative in certain province.
Zambians did not want to hear this accused of the civilization of "allegiance."
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Let me say that even if I was tired, I sit outside the hall while he is speaking, Karume said things are more important than the hours given by other honorable members.
In a short time, Karume called the dictatorial dictatorship in CCM; he noted the dangers that faces the union; he reminded the news of the shifts of leading the country that was caused by two countries; and more importantly, he said from his heart that ASP has not died because his members are still alive.
CCM we have ze or we will say, that is the truth from Karume, who is now the name is nonsense and women Nape Nnauye.

There was a hashtag for three days, Tanzania witnessed more than 2000 members who were crying and complaining inside the hall.
The chairperson launched the attack and was received by delegates at the official meetings in the sleeping houses and in vehicles.
The Shadow Party of Democracy and Development (CHADEMA) formed a lot of delegates and made the leaders to lose direction and start insulting the careless.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
It was not expected that the chairman also would have entered into the trap, when he found them to insult the opponents and especially CHADEMA by calling them "bad people," or when in NEC, he is using a lot of time to beat Nape Nnauye because he knows how to be with CHADEMA.
Even when he was reminded by his friend that to insult CHADEMA, it is not a must to get CCM, he threatened to say "they have left Nape to address them."
The work that defeated him, he sees it best to make Nape.
As Mzee Rasheed Kawawa when he used to a teacher, Nape is the same for Kikwete!
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
The old man from the Southern Highlands questioned, how come CHADEMA be a threat to CCM than corruption and corruption is a threat?
CHADEMA come as a threat than "undugged" stations "that is interested in the position of recognition in our party's constitution?
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
He said, how come the chief advisers of our party's chairperson about the issues of the party, not sessions but are the security that are fitted?
This was the same symbol and many who were complaining for three days of the meeting.

Membe: Alimitating Mangula; has changed again.

The position of Bernard Membe for the politics of this nation in the future was in a very difficult exam.
The camp of his former friend, Edward Lowassa was unable to bear him but he was rescued by Kikwete and his family.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Kikwete helped him by changing the voting schedule, while his family (his wife and his child) were worried every corner to seek votes Bernard Membe.
This nation one day will claim to know the truth of tensions and friendship of these three people - Membe, Kikwete and Lowassa.
Name Kikwete is getting ready in the middle.
She is the key to this uncertainty.
We had to leave it Now.

Mzee Philip Mangula when he emerged as a sudden as the vice chairperson of CCM Mainland.
This is also the online group that brought him to the State House, claiming that he was disappointed during that company and decided to throw him soon after Kikwete was sworn in.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Yassaid, Benard Membe, an experienced man and an illusion of the strategies of the natural network, told Kikwete that Mangula gave him a very difficult situation thus he is removed from the position of the secretary general of the party.
It does not end up there, Mzee Mangula when he tried to show up to Iringa as the chairman of the province that was dealing with him and was defeated by a person who does not belong to CCM for all the criteria.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
Mzee Mangula admitted later that inside CCM, the leadership is on an auction and the voters do not want to stop the candidates' leaflets, but they want to "be swept away."
Mzee Mangula, whenever he is reminded of the activities of the network, he always thinks that he was being offered by "faulty."
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
There is news that Mzee Mangula has emerged with the support of Membe.
That, several sessions were done to Makambako among these two.
Whether for Membe to be willing or sent, it is that they met the agenda was an election in the 8th general meeting.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
He was apologized or had not been asked, that is not the news.
The news is that the general meeting has given Mzee Mangula as the deputy chairperson of CCM but the chief executive was Membe.
If this project was for the benefit of the party or for the benefit of his network he is designed for 2015, it is an issue of time.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
If it is true, then it will be difficult to denounce the networks inside this party.
As Membe's network is legitimate, Lowassa cannot be illegal.
If Kikwete entered with the internet, it is difficult to think about CCM and the presidency without the internet.
And we have learned in bitterness that the network did not get in the elections because, after their person being elected, what is next is to benefit the sweat and the fruits of work.

For those who failed, there is a work to assess where they are stuck and hoped continental.
It is a dream of each other to break the groups when whoever wins and entered the State House continues with his group.

Only one thing the Elder Mangula was to read it.
Membe who is alleged to bear him after the 2005 elections in front of Kikwete, he cannot change today and defend himself as a good person who goes to the party.
Why did he not be in 2005 under the chairman hug this?
Membe is the same one, the chairperson is the same one, the party is what and Mangula is the same one!
What has changed to make Mangula who is not in 2005, afae in 2012?
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
What is seen but you are not surprised but clearly, it is the fact that Kikwete and Membe see companion / rival Lowassa being more than the presidential candidate of CCM 2015.
For them, Lowassa has turned out to be a party; he has ruled CCM in front of their eyes and think Mangula will help them to save CCM that is hostage in the hands of Lowassa.
Kikwete and Membe have not said the story is what has created Lowassa and made him put him out of CCM.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
The act of returning to the former "enemy" and their party will be able to help them to form the party that destroys it in their hands, is not understandable.
Many thought, the general meeting would garner the opportunity to assess this situation, instead we ended up with arguing that are not an order.
We wait for another special general meeting or that of 2017.
