The state of the debate on the government's budget for the financial year 2012 / 2013 in parliament is not satisfactory, some of the members of parliament showing the little ability to afford economic debates and instead, they have directed them to the competition of political arguments, the government has ruled among them the amount of throwing words that are non-civilization, Citizen Mwema, has noted.
That situation is seen when the Minister of Finance, Doctor.
William Mgimwa has already announced his budget with Shadow Finance Minister, from the opposition camp, Kabwe, while presenting his alternative budget that has been published in the local pages of this newspaper.
The trend of displaced and politically motivated violence has come out among the members of parliament two days after the debate on the budget started by members of parliament, John Mnyika, Mwigulu Nchemba, Peter Msigwa and Captain John Komba, Chiku About, Kangi Ligora, Ezekiah Wenje, on a way in the trend of debates, it has proven itself in the political argument, but the minister of state, office of the president, parliament and coordination, William Lukuvi, calling on leaders of the parliamentary camps to be on the forefront to protect the honor of that national pillar, that represents the public.
The member of parliament for Ubungo, John Mnyika (CHADEMA) who compared some of the members of parliament equivalent to the "pain" not to be responded to their concerns and said that the Revolutionary Party (CCM) is nonsense and the president is weak, found himself out of the parliament hall after Lukuvi, to read the regulations regarding the procedure of parliamentary debates to confirm that, Mnyika has broken the procedures.
Previously, before Mnyika he said the president is weak and compared some of the members of parliament to be the same as the pain and CCM is nonsense, the situation that made the deputy speaker, Job Ndugai, wanting him to look for those words in explanation that it is an annoying language, which is against the regulations of running the parliament activities.
After the time of window, Mnyika opened the statement of calling the others to be allowed to continue with the debate, but as he continues, the member of parliament of Iringa Town, Pastor Peter Msigwa was involved in saying words, contrary to the regulations of the parliament that directed other members of parliament not to speak when their colleague speaks with the speaker's permission.
But when Mnyika giving that language, as well as claiming that the president is weak, contrary to the requirements of the parliamentary regulations and to reach a step of being released outside the parliament hall, the member of parliament of Iramba West, Mwigulu Nchemba, the day before yesterday evening, in a state of showing political violence, he called a budget that was organized by the opposition camp in parliament that it is "waste" and decided to put the copy of the speech that he was holding on the hand while contributing to the debate.
However, in what proves the weakness of the leading session of that day, chairman Silvester Mabumba, was unable to control the government's attention.
Apart from those members of parliament, the member of parliament for Singida East, Tundu Lissu, on Monday also compared the session of parliamentary meetings about the budget to be the same as the season of ignorance (silly season), but on his part, the member of parliament of Mbinga West, Captain John Komba (CCM), who requested for civilization will be taken to parliament and warned that, if the boxing camp will be used because the number of their boxing is small and the side of CCM have a lot of boxing.
As members of parliament were intended to show misconduct within the axis, the noise that aren't prepared or consent of the deputy speaker who was leading the session were many, one side of the noise showing the situation of being bullied by others, trying to show that the cry of bullied is not correct.
It is a discussion that is translated to denying citizens an opportunity to know more about the economic and cultural situation in general, from their representatives who now have decided to enter into political tensions.
The Deputy speaker of Parliament, Job Ndugai tried to stop the weather by using the rapist, assisted by Minister Lukuvi.
But some of the concerns raised by the opposition members is together with the statement of the member of parliament of Mwibara, Kangi Ligora, who was surprised with the members of parliament without respecting the Revolutionary Party that pay the salaries.
Kangi Lugola is one of the few members of CCM who had signed a document of not having faith in the prime minister, under the coordination of Kigoma North member of parliament, Kabwe, found himself in a difficult time, after the Mbozi West member of parliament, David Silinde wanted a guide to the speaker so as to look for that statement, an argument that was emphasized by the member of parliament, James Mbatia.
In his argument, Silinde urged the government to fix his instructions which outlined mistakes that are available in the speech of the opposition camp, and especially in the collection of revenue collection.
But Silinde was opposed by the member of parliament, Christopher Ole Sendeka who read the book of the opposition budget speech to confirm those mistakes and at the same time, reading the book of the Minister of Finance, Doctor.
William Mgimwa, to confirm what is described as a concentration in the writing of the budget.
The current meeting of parliament will return to the previous meetings where the three members of CHADEMA had been released outside the sessions, with the mistake of not following the requirements of the regulations of the parliamentary sessions.
The members of parliament of CHADEMA that have ever been released outside the parliament hall is together with the former member of parliament of Arusha Town, Godbless Lema, the member of parliament of Singida East, Tundu Lissu and the member of parliament of Iringa Town, Pastor Peter Msigwa.
While the members of parliament signing a record of being released outside the parliament in this 10th parliament, in the ninth parliament, the member of parliament for Bariadi East, John Cheyo, once was released outside the parliament hall and the former speaker of that time, Samuel Sitta.
