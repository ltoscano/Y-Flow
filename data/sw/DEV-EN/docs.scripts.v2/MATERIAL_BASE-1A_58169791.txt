The next week, on Thursday, June 14, Minister of Finance, Doctor.
William Mgimwa is expected to present the national budget for the financial year 2012 / 2013.
This will be the seventh budget since President Jakaya Kikwete entered power in the year 2005.
It will be a budget that makes the previous budget before President Kikwete to leave power according to the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania.
But this will also be the second budget for the second term of President Kikwete.
In all the past six budgets, as usual, they have been successful and it can be explained to have been contributed to the weaknesses that have emerged in the management of those budgets.
It is possible, the weaknesses or stability in the previous budget has been contributed in a certain way by ministers of the concerned funds or even some of the government officials and sponsors of the budget.
It is our expectations that, the vulnerability in the past six budget will be used as a class to learn and strengthen the seventh budget which will be the first budget for the new finance minister, Doctor.

But on the other hand, the strength of the previous budget in some areas of implementation will be used as a criterion to continue improving this budget.
It is our expectations, this budget will give solutions to many non-economic problems in the country.
It is our expectations, the budget that will promote new revenue sources and will reduce tax exemptions too.
The biggest one is that, we hope that this budget will put strategies to control the inflation of important products in the country.
Meaning, it will be a budget for the citizens.
On the other hand, we expect this budget to focus on the advice of the executive council of the Revolutionary Party (CCM) wanting the value added tax (VAT) to be withdrawn from food.
Furthermore, we hope the budget will focus on another advice with the interests of the nation from other political parties and other private institutions in the country.
Basically, we are expecting a budget with satisfactory answers about the problems that make the economy of our country.
