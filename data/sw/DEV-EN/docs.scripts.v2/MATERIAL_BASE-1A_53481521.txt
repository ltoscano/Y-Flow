The Provincial Commissioner of Dar es Salaam, Paul Makonda, has given 25 days to the contractor of Texas Company, Francis Musiba to complete the construction of the bridge that joins Tabata Kinyerezi area and Bonyoto.

Moreover, he has directed the engineer of Ilala Municipality, Nyamagalula Masatu to make sure he is cooperating with the Tanzania Roads Agency (TANROADS) to inspect that construction as a quality and the required level has been reached.
Makonda gave that statement when he visited Kinyerezi bridge and inspected the bridge as part of his tour in Ilala district.
Despite that directive, he has also ordered the Roads Agency (TANROADS) and the supervisors of that project to inspect the quality of the bridge if it has the required standards before starting to be used.
He gave that directive after the citizens of that area to complain about the delay of the project that was mentioned in the year 2013.
After those complaints, Makonda asked the member of parliament of Segerea, Bonna Kaluwa, as he once arrived at the bridge to inspect the construction where he admitted and joined the citizens accusing the contractor for delaying the construction of that bridge.
"I am here five times and the contractor told me this bridge would have been completed within four days since April 2016 but until now it has not been completed and my citizens are continuing to suffer," said Bonna.
The answer made Makonda wanting Masatu to put open the contract of that bridge was signed when he answered that the contract was signed on March 30th, 2015 and started on June 30, 2015.
However, the representative of the Texas Company, Musiba denied the construction reports to start in the year 2013 and claimed that it took place on April 29 this year.
"This bridge is under the agency of roads (TANROADS), therefore we are waiting to get a permit to demolish some of the areas that are reviewed by this project from Ilala Municipality," he said.
Makonda said that if the construction will not end in that period, he will not be given any tender in Dar es Salaam.
In another step, Makonda instructed the police commander of Kipolisi, Ilala, Salum Hamlow to arrest the chairman of Bonyoby, Solomon Kagaruki, on accusations of not implementing its responsibilities including taking bribes, threatening citizens and also alleged to take 10 percent of the price of the plots that are sold.
