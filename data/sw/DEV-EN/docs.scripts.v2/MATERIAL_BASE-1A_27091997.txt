That game that took place at the Uhuru Stadium in Dar es Salaam, was previously held on Wednesday together with other matches including Simba and Prisons, but it was pushed back after JKT asked.
The national building team requested the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) through the league board urging them to bring them ahead of one day after getting tired of the long journey from Bukoba, Kagera where I had a match at the end of last week.
Together with the results of their game against Yanga who were scored 2-1, the big one is the end of the first round of that league that involves a total of 16 teams.
That league was finalized we will have a representatives of Tanzania Mainland in the international competition of the champions league together with that of the African Confederation.
The first round has ended with a lot of challenges, which are supposed to be amended or not we will continue to be an actor in national football for the club and even our national teams.
All the days when you have a national premier league, undoubtedly you will get a weak national team because its players are benefiting from the clubs, which are participating in that bad league that is not competitive.
On the side of the club, they are the same as the team will get a championship without using the mind, strength or their efforts, thus he will be found a champion who is not capable, who is participating in the international competition will be released early.
The first round of the Tanzania Mainland Premier League have witnessed a huge tension on the side of the referees, some of them have been unable to comply with 17 soccer laws by being formed.
It is possible for other referees to form a bad luck and some did so intentionally after being pushed by pressure from some side or others did not want to do so, but because of no knowledge of those laws, that is why they found themselves in trouble.
To know the law is one issue and to implement it is another issue, therefore, that can also be the existence of our referees, who have failed to do well.
On the side of TFF themselves, they are required to be very careful because we have seen the mistakes of referees have ever caused incidents of breach of peace as at the National Stadium, where Simba fans broke chairs.
Referees being unable to follow the procedures or soccer laws not only can cause non-wise lovers and to destroy the infrastructure, they can also be the referees.
It is the expectation of soccer stakeholders to be TFF in the second round of the Tanzania Mainland Premier League, it will take a big step to ensure the referees that are planned to make soccer in justice without any privilege.
