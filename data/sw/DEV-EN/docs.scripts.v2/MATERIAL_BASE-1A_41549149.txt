The Minister of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Nape Nnauye the day before yesterday announced the ban of the old teams to use the National Stadium due to his fans to destroy the infrastructure of the stadium including breaking the ball and holding chairs in the premier league match that brought together the giants at the end of last week.
Doctor Kebwe said that when he spoke to the leaders of Morogoro Football Association (MRFA), the leadership of the Jamhuri Stadium and the players of Morogoro Police soccer team together with their leaders after the completion of the First Division League match against Njombe town the day before yesterday at the stadium.
That provincial commissioner said he is supporting the decision by Minister Nape to stop those teams with many fans to use that stadium.
"The National Stadium has been built by our friends of China by using a high cost that is tax for citizens... Yanga and Simba have gone through the loss of the government and because they don't have a chance to use that stadium, we welcome them to use it at the Jamhuri Stadium because there is no seats to shine," said Doctor Kebwe.
Therefore, he instructed the leadership of the Jamhuri Stadium to start producing huge renovation of infrastructure and the area of playing with other games so as to meet modern standards for the purpose of playing national and international games.
"I call three months to the leaders of this stadium to start renovating them to be modern starting from athletics, football, hands and netball and while in those standards, we welcome them to invite Yanga and Simba to come and play at the Jamhuri Stadium," said Doctor Kebwe.
In addition, Doctor Kebwe has praised Morogoro Police team for starting well in the First Division League competition in his group, he urged them to put more effort and knowledge by following the instructions of their teachers so as to play well in the next games inside and outside that province.
"I would like to see Morogoro Police team moves to the premier league... that is why the provincial government and various local and foreign stakeholders have abandoned their energy to support this team to do well and eventually to play the premier league next season," said Doctor Kebwe.
He said in order to promote football and others, it is good for the leadership of that stadium to take a step of renovating different areas for the purpose of being used.
On his part, the chairperson of MRFA Pascal Kihanga said that the province has intended to see Morogoro Police team will return to the premier league and urged the players to come out because the sports stakeholders are together with them.
Morogoro Regional Police Commander Ulrich Matei said the team is the property of the citizens of that province, therefore they have to support him because it is doing well it will bring him the reputation in the whole province and the police force in Morogoro.
