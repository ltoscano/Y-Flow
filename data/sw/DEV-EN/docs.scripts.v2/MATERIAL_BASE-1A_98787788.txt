In addition, he said in dealing with the fire incidents, they will ensure all schools have enough protection so as to prevent those acts to continue.
Speaking to journalists just after visiting that school, with the defense and security committee together with the member of parliament of Chalinze region, Ridhiwani Kikwete, the district commissioner, Majid Mwanga said they are continuing with investigations on the incident.
Mwanga said that the incident is sad because the government has been doing efforts to ensure students sitting on a dormitory so that they can get a lot of time to study especially female.
It is surprising to see that the dormitory of girls is reduced while there is no student or someone when the fire happens.
The head teacher of that school, Justine Lyamuya said, all their equipment were reduced, including 75 beds and mattresses, all the items being worth 24 million shillings.
Lyamuya said that the dormitory was built recently for 50 million shillings and in that event, five children went away after being left behind by smoke while trying to save things.
Ridhiwani said, the government will ensure all those involved are arrested and also the event will be examined and know who was involved in those events to come out regularly.
He said that he has already called a session on October 9, this year for education stakeholders, parents and those in order to discuss how to deal with that problem that happened on October 5th.
