I have not been in the diaspora at the end of February I was expected to be the best way it will disappear and the drought will go.
The situation was very different.
The snow storm has continued until April.
The residents of here failed to understand how it is.
Experts said such a situation has never happened in the past 20 years.
And in my home and followed up on the news of Tanzania, I see rain and floods have ruled the whole country.
In March it is not normal to see flooding like this until palpable homes and people lost their lives.
This is the climate change that hit the whole world due to pollution.
In order to understand that these changes are good to look at his detail, his source, the future of his actions and actions taken.
We should not allow you to think about our roads in Dar es Salaam to flood or our houses collapsed.
Talk about the whole world to flood or burn.
The primary thing is to understand that this is the destruction of a human being.

Peter Werner, a weather expert in the Potsdam of the National Weather Service, says: "We are investigating the global weather, such as the amount of rain that is not normal, floods, drought, storm, and see its change, we can say in fact that unusual conditions have increased four times in the past 50 years."
He says that these changes have been caused by an increase in certain gas in the air like the river, carbon emission, I will have attained the Saidi and exhaane.
But he has destroyed the original system.
It is because for a long time industries and vehicles have been devastated by billions of tons of gas that cause temperatures.
Scientists are worried that the increase in the gas has blocked additional temperatures from the world.
Therefore, those gas is a luxury, in the air of the world like a glass of front of the vehicle as it comes inside the vehicle.

The International panel of Climate Change (IPCC) that is sponsored by the United Nations has released a 2,500 pages report that passed the international meeting at the end of March this year in Yokrelocate, Japan.

Many researchers believe that this summer increase is causing serious climate change in the world.
They believe that there has been a huge increase in rain in the north of the world, as well as drought in Asia and Africa.
We have seen how El Niameo has happened in the Pacific and spread elsewhere.
The IPCC report issued a stern warning explaining how climate change has been causing the weather to change so much to endanger the water sources and access to food.
The chairperson of IPCC, Dak Rajoelina Pochuri said it is good if the world will look at this report, because if it will be ignored then its results are risking the community and the entire human system.
The rest of the world's poor people - in the country "rich" and the country "poor."
Since the fact is that the number of poor people grow even in a rich country.
"We pretend that we live in a rich country we are safe and that those who will be affected are the people of the poor country," said Puzuri and added, "you need to look at the storm of Sandy (New York) as a small example."
At the IPCC, one participant is activist Mrs. Christian Teriete urged a rich country to lead in preventing climate change.
