In that game that was played at the Majimaji Songea stadium, the hosts celebrated 1-0 goals.
Speaking to this newspaper yesterday Ongalla, said that his team ruled the ball with a big percentage in that game but unfortunately they were forgotten and scored that goal.
"If you look at the whole game, we played well and said we were unable to use the chances we got in closing, our colleagues got an opportunity and bring us," he said.
Ongalla said they are continuing to fix the mistakes and procedures are changing because it is needed is tolerance to the fans of that team.
Majimaji this season things have been bad after losing eight games out of nine that played.
Since Ongalla, joining that team lost two games and won one, while giving me the heart that things will change time is not long.
He said anything is possible because there are many games in front and that they are continuing with preparations to solidify them so as to get good results.
