The leadership of Simba Club today is expected to officially submit his complaints to the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) and the League Board (TLB) in order to make the referee for their match against Yanga, Martin Saanya.
Simba and Yanga met at the National Stadium at the end of the week and drew 1-1 in the match that was full of violence.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
The violence emerged from the leading goal of Yanga that was scored by Amisi Tambwe, which was reported because before he scored, the player wondered the ball with the hand that caused the violence to the fans of Simba because earlier Ibrahim Ajibu scored against Simba the goal that was rejected by the referee for claims he had lost.
The fans went far from holding the chairs of the stadium and shut down the pitch.
"With great sadness the Simba club has been very disappointed by the actions made by some of our fans to break the section of the National Stadium, an act that happened yesterday (the day before yesterday) in our premier league game against Yanga team..." We believe the evil actions made by our fans were caused by the decision that was caused by those referees especially Martin Saanya, "said Manara.
"It was unclear how the referee used to accept the 'ball of the ring' of Yanga striker, Amisi Tambwe and refused the legitimate goal of our striker Ibrahim Ajibu.
In that game the big violence broke out and caused the police to use extra strength by using bombs to stop the violence that some people were hurt.
Moreover, Manara has apologized for the action of their fans to throw chairs and said they will communicate with the concerned authorities to pay them.
"We apologize for this case and the club has agreed to pay for the cost of this destruction.
The club will talk with the owners of this stadium to see how they get those costs, I hope that this will not come out again. "
"However, we have already been surprised by the action of giving a red card to our captain, Jonas Mkude, this situation as the captain followed him to go to him who complained to his action of accepting the 'dirty' goal of Tambwe and all of us have seen Saanya was taking the while he returns behind and falling, and then got up and gave a red card to Mkude..." we believe this time TFF and the league board will give a stern warning to these referees to be a lesson for the wrong decisions of this type.
"Also the club has complained about the action of our rooms for changing clothes that were given drugs that had the intention to affect our players before the match started, we requested the authorities to make a thorough investigation to determine this act that is not certain that is believed to be done by our opponents.
"We know their mission is to make our players butoke, but our team of scientists took the right steps to make our players be able to finish the ninety minutes of the game with the ability and professionalism," he said.
That is the second match to referee Saanya being reported by the goal of that kind which last season in the FA match between Yanga and Coast Union that took place at the Mkwakwani Tanga Stadium and Yanga won 2-1, the game broke down after the heavy chaos broke.
In that game, Saanya was forced to break the game after Yanga's goalkeeper Deogratius Munish (Dida), being attacked by Coast fans while defender Oscar Joshua was beaten by bottles at the head.
In that game, Tambwe entered the position of Donald Ngoma gave Yanga the second goal in the Simba's goal of the day before yesterday and Coast to complain about that goal being of support.
