Speaking to journalists yesterday, Manji urged the members of the club to come out in large numbers at that meeting that will take place at the club's headquarters in the desert, Dar es Salaam to discuss various issues including the registration of that club.
"The meeting will be free and fair to every member who has paid his card, he will be given a chance to give feedback with his quits before the agreement reached," said Manji.
Manji said that he has heard in the press (not this newspaper) that the secretary of the council of elders of Yanga, Ibrahim Akilimali has said that he has not paid membership fees, something that allows him to be a member, but Akilimali has confirmed to this newspaper that he is a active member since his card has paid a whole year.
However, Akilimali has speaking on phone with this newspaper later yesterday, he said that he is a legitimate member and he has the right to attend that meeting because he has paid his card at the end of one.
He said that since he got his card, six months have passed, he still has six months before the end of the time he will pay for one year.
Manji said after the agreement of that general meeting to take place at the exercise stadium will start being built within 90 days in Gezaulole area that is in Kigamboni, according to the contract that was signed by Yanga Yetu Company.
Moreover, Manji said about the issue of the signing of a contract with the board of trustees against the Yanga Company Yetu everything that will be discussed at that meeting, where members have been asked to be early as security is uncertain.
He said if there will be a non-profit conflict between him and Yanga, then the members who will decide whether he can continue or sit along, he is ready to obey any decision.
Manji said instead of the members rushing to the media to talk about the issues of the club are required to come out in large numbers in that meeting so as to contribute to the benefits of Yanga.
This emergency meeting is taking place while there were uncertainty about how the signing of Yanga Club for Yanga Club has been signed as they violated some of the necessary procedures.
