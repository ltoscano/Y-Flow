Hospitals in the country are supposed to start offering medical supplies to patients with chronic diseases.
That advice was given by various stakeholders including the Ocean Road Cancer Institute, the Ministry of Health, Social Development, Gender, Elderly and Children and stakeholders after the government passing the guidance in April this year, which involves how to serve the patients.

Speaking in the day before yesterday in Dar es Salaam, the executive director of that institution, Doctor Julius Mwaiselage said, treatment shufaa is required to be given to patients with illnesses that were unable to hospital so as to enable a patient to live life with comfort and die in death.
"Patients with chronic diseases including AIDS, diabetes, cancer and selfish diseases even those who got a motorcycle accident, they have been believing that they are people to die, believing there are no people to give birth to them, but by adopting that guide, it will help to provide education from the level of their families," he said.
The coordinator of non-communicable diseases from the Ministry of Health, Doctor Sarah Maair said, his ministry does not support the importance of staying with stakeholders and to create a policy guidance that allows all health stakeholders to do what to help the patients that got up to live.
He said they will start giving education to stakeholders so as to reach those who cannot arrive at the Ocean Road Hospital, to get that service where they are based.
Director of the Tanzania Medical Association (TPCA), Doctor Elias Muganyizi said, there is a need for the district to start setting aside the budget to provide education to people about that treatment.
The planning officer of the International Health Organization (GOP), Doctor Hussein Mtiro said, the service is not expensive, but it is an act of someone to change his negative view and to make a patient so as to increase the day to live in the world.
