The resident market in the world has crashed and affected various countries that protect that product including Tanzania.
However, the government has said it will work on that situation so as to make sure it is looking for markets and alternative buyers to be resident that are in the country including Bahati (Manyara), Lindi and Mtwara.

The Deputy Minister of Agriculture Livestock and Fisheries, William Ole Nasha acknowledged that the residence price in the country has dropped and that the resident market has been built in the whole world.
He was responding to an additional question in Bahati's member of parliament, Pauline Gekul (Chadema) who said that his residence and the business people have refused to buy them including a big buyer in India while neighboring countries of Uganda and Kenya have been encouraged and wanted to know the government is making an effort to save the situation.
Responding to the additional question, Nasha said that the resident market has been built in the whole world and the big buyers have refused to buy permanent residence at the initial price and to give an example of Mtwara and Lindi that they were bought to 500 shillings for one kilogram.
However, Nasha said the government is making efforts to look for a big buyer who will buy the residence of farmers here in the country for a good way.
In the primary question, the Member of Parliament for Lupembe, Joram Hongoli (CCM) wanted to know how the government should deal with the conflict between the citizens and the investor who was given the Igombolo factory, since 2009.
Nasha said that the investor of tiques Mercantile (EA) Limited won the case by the union of cooperatives, Lupembe, (ACLU) was ordered by compensation that is estimated to be 28 billion shillings together with the cost of running the case, but that he will appeal and therefore the case is still in court.
The Minister of Agriculture Livestock and Fisheries, Doctor Charles Tizeba said the conflict has come at the end and urged the ambassador to stop holding onto and reject the court decisions in order to avoid conflicts and enable citizens to benefit from development that are being done by the investor.
