"I was able to believe or discover if I can lead people, but after getting training for now I believe and I know my right," says Neema Mayenga, the chairman of the Kiwi market in the city.
Neema (40) a mother of five children says the education that he got through the training of legal assistance to the business people in the market from the organization of Equality for Growth (EFG) made him change the change of his business.
"These achievements have also helped other women to realize themselves and know their rights and therefore make correct decisions without fear," he says.
Neema, a small sign of vegetables and fruits in the Kiwi market, he says apart from improving his life, the training was teaching how to help others.
He elaborates on that the training that were given by EFG and sponsored by the Institute of Administration and Local Government in protecting the rights of women in the markets in Ilala district (LSF), made him know how he can achieve its goals.
However, the research that was done by the LSF project showed that Neema is the first woman to be elected as the chairman of the market, because many markets in the country have been chairpersons of men and not women.

Neema who is the only chairperson of the market for women in the whole of Tanzania, explains that the market has a good toilet and bathroom and that waste is collected every day and a car for carrying the waste that is usually in time and removing and thus making the market to be clean at all times.
However, the tax that is collected in Kiwi market is 300,000 shillings per month and that amount is little because of the business being bad and some of the function of the market have asted their businesses from being bad.
Markets are crowded?
He is saying that for now gender violence has decreased due to everyone to recognize his rights.
