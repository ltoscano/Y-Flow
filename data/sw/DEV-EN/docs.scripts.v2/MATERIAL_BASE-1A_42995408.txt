The thirst of the member of parliament of Arusha town, Gobless Lema getting bail and to come out of the law after languishing in prison for four weeks now, continues to be praised after the lawyers of the government submitted the appeal of that parliamentarian to be heard at the high court in Arusha region.

Lema was unable to put in the court room for the purpose of listening to his case, instead for all the time since 2: 14 am until 6: 18 pm he was only in prison waiting to be taken to court and then after some time, he went to the prison window to go to a kiss of Kisongo where he has been there for more than 26 days now due to being stuck on bail.
That appeal has been opposed by government lawyers who are Paulo Kadushi and Matereus Marandu claiming that the appeal that was taken by the lawyers of Lema has not met the legal requirements because those lawyers bought appeal instead of showing the intention of appeal.
Materu said they have presented their objection in front of Judge Fatma Masengi to oppose the Supreme Court not listening to a bail case because the lawyers defended Lema, who is Peter Kibatala and Sheck Mfinanga, have left the appeal instead of presenting a notice of the intention to appeal within 10 days after previously the judge gave a request to be heard of that appeal.
"We today have put a petition to be heard in this case because these colleagues have already left them instead of presenting a petition to appeal, they rushed to appeal and the law does not say that it should be the first to make the intention of cutting the appeal and then appeal," explained Materu.
Therefore the petition to appeal will be presented in the text tomorrow November 30th, this year at 2: 00 am, the government's side will submit to their arguments and six hours on the same day, and the side of the lawyers of Lema will answer the concerns of those lawyers in the text and Judge, Masengi will go through those concerns at nine o'clock in the afternoon.
Then Judge Masengi will give the decision against the petition on December 2nd this year and if he will agree with the government's side, Lema will fail and if Lema's argument won against the government's objection, the basic case to be heard by the request of the member of parliament will be heard and given a decision.
The lawyers of the member of parliament led by Kibatala, said they had previously requested an appeal number 112 / 113 of the year 2016, the high court in Arusha region so as to claim the justice of Lema being denied due to legal mistakes that were done by the resident magistrate of Arusha.
