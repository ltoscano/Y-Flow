The leadership of the Buguruni market have requested the Municipal Council of Ilala to stop bureaucracy and put open revenue that is found due to the collection of tax for traders to the leadership committee of that market so as to improve the infrastructure of that market.
Speaking to journalists in Dar es Salaam yesterday, the chairman of the market Said Kondo said that the market has a total of 3,200 business people that were registered officially amid more than 1,000 attackers outside the market who have been doing business without paying tax.
He said that action of the council is not clear to the market committee about the income that is found due to tax causes the improvement of the market.
"The Buguruni market is facing challenges of destruction of infrastructure due to the buildings, a situation that causes many products in the market to drop the value due to the decade of rain or sun," he said.
Moreover, he added that for now the real business situation in the market is not good, many business people have improved economically due to the circulation of money that it is not good.
"Now, the prices of products are competitive, traders are selling depending on how they bought so that they get profit, the market is the competition to bring good products that will sell and bring bad products you will get losses and that business from farmers are coming as usual," insisted Kondo.
Speaking about the reasons for some of the business people that run their businesses in the market without paying tax, he said that this is due to some of them to take the statement of President Doctor.
John Magufuli that he made recently that business people "should not be left to do business.
"As a result of this step, I requested the Ilala Municipality adviser to look at the possibility of to also seek official areas for all business people who intervened in the market contrary to the procedures so as to eliminate the existing congestion at the moment, especially considering this market, the window does not withstand the big group of people," said the chairperson.
