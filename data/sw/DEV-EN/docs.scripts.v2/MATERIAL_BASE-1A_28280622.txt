December every year is a month where many families are united, because many workers tend to take a holiday and students go to school for a long holiday.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
"But I'm not Going to do it.
As a result of that reason, many families tend to travel to different areas to change the environment.
In the past, the hosts of Kilimanjaro Province had a culture that by this month they must go to their home to celebrate Christmas and New Year holidays.
But in recent years, this situation has spread across all provinces of Tanzania, where families may celebrate the holidays with parents or their families in the villages.
As a result of this culture, it was built up in many families in the country for this month of December, the bus owners in the provinces have been seeing that is the only area of being sent quickly by increasing the fare for buses.
The fare rises every year from 15th this month, due to People travelling in numbers.
The program owners increase the fare every day according to the population is increasing.
The ones with buses pass the season to be a grace or the harvest because they impose huge fare, because they understand it must get passengers.
The fare in fact has been a great pain for many passengers, especially those with low income.
For example the years ago, the fare to go to Kilimanjaro or Arusha was between 20,000 and 30,000 shillings, but when it comes to this period of "harvest," rises up to 50,000 to 70,000 shillings.
For those who travel this month of December, they will agree with me about the fare, as I explained above, it has been a tradition for people from all provinces to celebrate the holiday in where they were born.
A good example is at the central bus station of Ubungo in Dar es Salaam city, where in the period from December 15 to 24, most of the buses have already been completed, that is the passengers have already paid tickets early.
But there has also been a dirty game to some of the people who call themselves the bus agents.
They have been buying those tickets early with the aim of selling them at high prices.
And this period the passengers are usually many in that bus station because they lack the transportation of going to where we are headed.
This thing we have been witnessing for all the years, although three years ago the Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA), has been able to act by beating all the fines that increase the price, a step that has reduced the little to them.
I am saying Summer has reduced the problem because when they inspected the fares of those buses, they are showing that they have been sold at the normal price, but many citizens are complaining to be sold by those agents at high prices.
My request to SUMATRA is to ensure that it will control this situation to happen this year.
It will use all the tactics to arrest a few clever people who hurt the citizens by switching off the tickets in this festive season, who they call the season of harvest.
In order to stop this situation, it is good for passengers to give information early when they meet the trouble, although others feel it's okay because they have been prepared to travel and they have the ability to pay any fare.
I am sure if citizens will cooperate well with the state agencies, there will be no haphazard increase in fare in this Christmas season and the new year.
