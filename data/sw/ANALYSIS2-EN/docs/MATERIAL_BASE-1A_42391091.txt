<4>	MCHEZAJI wa zamani wa Yanga, Mrisho Ngassa amejitoa katika timu ya Free State Stars ya mjini Bathlehem, Afrika Kusini baada ya kuchoshwa na benchi.	former Yanga player, Mrisho Ngassa, has ended his contract with the Free State Stars team in Bethlehem, South Africa, after being relegated to the bench.
<5>	Ngassa ameshindwa kumshawishi kocha mpya wa timu hiyo, Mfaransa Denis Lavagne na kumfanya kumuweka benchi kwa muda mrefu.	Ngassa has failed to persuade the new coach of the team, Frenchman Denis Lavagne, not to make him sit on the bench for a long time.
<6>	Takwimu zinaonesha tangu kiungo mshambuliaji huyo atue State takribani mwaka mmoja, hajafunga bao pia hajaweza kuisaidia kupata mabao, kitu ambacho kilimuweka kwenye hali ngumu na kujikuta akisugua benchi.	statistics show that since the striker arrived almost a year ago, he has neither scored nor been able to assist in getting a goal, something that put him in a difficult situation, and he found himself on the bench.
<7>	Kitendo hicho cha Ngassa kushindwa kuonesha uwezo kilimweka kwenye uhusiano mbaya na kocha wake Lavagne ambaye alimtamkia wazi kuwa Tanzania haiwezi kuwa na mchezaji bora.	Ngassa's failure to show his potential on the field sparked a bad relationship with his coach Lavagne, who clearly told him that Tanzania could have a better player.
<8>	Tangu kujiuzulu kwa kocha Kinnah Phiri baada ya kuboronga kwa timu yake, kwa kupoteza mechi tatu mfululizo katika ligi ya Afrika Kusini na kutua Mbeya City, Ngassa amekuwa kwenye wakati mgumu huku akidai kupewa mazoezi magumu ambayo hajawahi kukutana nayo kwa kipindi cha takribani miaka 10 ambayo amecheza soka.	ever since the resignation of coach Kinnah Phiri after his team's failure when they lost three consecutive matches in the South African league and settling in Mbeya City, Ngassa has had a difficult time, claiming that he's been given tougher exercises than he's ever seen in the 10 years or so that he has played soccer.
<9>	Ngassa alivunja mkataba wake na timu hiyo juzi, baada ya kikao kirefu na uongozi wa timu hiyo na kukubaliana.	Ngassa ended his contract with the team recently, after a long meeting with the team's leadership, who agreed to it.
<10>	Meneja Mkuu wa Free State Stars, Rants Makoena alikaririwa na mitandao mbali mbali ya habari kuwa wamekubaliana na ombi la Ngasa la kuvunja mkataba na wanamtakia safari njema ya maisha yake mapya nje ya Free State Stars.	the Free State Stars' manager, Rants Makoena, was quoted by various news networks that they have agreed with Ngasa's request to break the contract, and they wish him a good journey into his new life outside of Free State Stars.
<11>	Kuondoka kwa Ngassa pengo lake limezibwa na Hamis Kiiza ambaye amejiunga na timu hiyo hivi karibuni baada ya kufungashiwa virago na Simba baada ya Ligi Kuu msimu uliopita kumalizika, kwa kile kilichoelezwa kuwa ni utovu wa nidhamu.	since Ngassa's departure, his space has been filled by Hamis Kiiza, who joined the team recently after he was sacked by Simba when the last season of the premier league ended, for what was termed 'lack of discipline'.
<12>	Kwa upande wake, Ngassa alikaririwa na mtandao mmoja wa michezo akisema kwamba sababu kubwa za kuondoka Free State ni timu ambayo haina malengo ya kushinda taji.	for his part, Ngassa was quoted by one sports network, saying that his main reason for leaving the Free State is that it is a team that does not have the objective of winning a championship.
<13>	Kupitia akaunti yake ya Instagram, Ngassa aliandika ujumbe :	Ngassa posted this message on his Instagram account:
<14>	“Asante Mungu, nina furaha, dua zangu umekua ukiniitika kila ninapokuita.”	"thank you, God, I am happy that you have been responding to my prayers whenever I call for you."
<15>	Ngassa alijiunga na Free State Stars, Mei mwaka jana akisajiliwa na kocha Mmalawi, Kinnah Phiri kwa mkataba wa miaka minne, hata hivyo ameutumikia mwaka mmoja na kufungasha virago vyake.	Ngassa joined Free State Stars in May last year, signed by the Malawian coach, Kinnah Phiri, on a four-year contract, but now he leaves the team after just one year of his contract.
