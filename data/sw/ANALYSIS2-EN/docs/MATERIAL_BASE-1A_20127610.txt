<4>	WAZIRI wa Katiba na Sheria, Dk Harrison Mwakyembe amesema Serikali imedhamiria kupunguza mashauri ya kesi ndogo ndogo ambayo yana watuhumiwa wengi waliojazana magerezani ilhali mashauri yao yangeweza kumalizika kwa muda mfupi.	the Minister for Constitution and Law, Doctor Harrison Mwakyembe, has said that the government is determined to reduce small cases where the suspects, many of whom are congested in prison, could end their cases within a short time.
<5>	Aliyasema hayo jana Dar es Salaam wakati alipokutana na kuzungumza na Jaji Mkuu wa Jimbo la Australia ya Kusini nchini Australia, Chris Kourakis.	he said this yesterday in Dar es Salaam, when he met and talked with the Chief Judge of South Australia, an Australian state, Chris Kourakis.
<6>	Alisema uwepo wa mashauri mengi madogo ambayo watuhumiwa wake wanachukua nafasi kubwa kwenye magereza nchini, serikali na mahakama imeona ni eneo lenye changamoto na hivyo linatafutiwa ufumbuzi.	he said there are many small plans where suspects take up a lot of space in prisons in the country, and the Court of Justice has seen it's an area with a challenge and so is looking for a solution.
<7>	“Hili ni eneo moja ambalo mahakama imeona linahitaji kufanyiwa kazi na liko kwenye maeneo ya ushirikiano baina ya Tanzania na Australia Kusini, kwa sababu yakiangaliwa kwa ukaribu yatapunguza msongamano kwenye magereza yetu na hata kuokoa gharama za kuwatunza,” alisema.	"this is one area the court has seen that needs to be worked on, the area of cooperation between Tanzania and South Australia, because when looked at closely, they will reduce the congestion in our prisons and even save on the cost of caring for them," he said.
<8>	Akizungumzia maeneo ya ushirikiano yaliyoafikiwa kati ya Jaji Kourakis, Jaji Mkuu wa Tanzania, Othman Chande na Msajili Mkuu wa Mahakama, Katarina Revokati, Mwakyembe aliyataja kuwa ni mafunzo na kuwajengea uwezo watumishi wa Mahakama, kuboresha mifumo ya Tehama na kupitia upya Sheria ya Adhabu za Chini.	talking about the areas of cooperation that were reached between Judge Kourakis, Chief Judge of Tanzania, Othman Chande, and Chief Executive of Court, Katarina Revokati, he said it is a lesson in enabling court servants to improve the system of Tehama and revise a fresh law penalty act.
<9>	Akifafanua sheria hiyo, Katibu Mkuu wa Wizara hiyo, Profesa Sifuni Mchome alisema inaweka kiwango cha chini cha adhabu kwa makosa fulani ambacho hakimu haruhusiwi kutoa adhabu chini ya hapo na kwa baadhi ya makosa.	explaining the law, the secretary general of the ministry, Professor Sifuni Mchome, said it is setting a minimum penalty for certain offenses that the judge is not allowed to give a penalty below, for some mistakes.
<10>	Jaji Kaurakis alisema nchini Australia, Sheria hiyo ipo na imeweka makosa machache ambayo jaji au hakimu haruhusiwi kutoa adhabu chini ya hapo ili kutoa nafasi ya majadiliano na mtuhumiwa kwa lengo la kutaka mtuhumiwa akubali na kukiri kosa kwa maana ya kujutia alichotenda.	Judge Kaurakis said in Australia the law is there, and it has had a few offenses where the judge or magistrate is not allowed to give a penalty below that, so as to give a chance to negotiate with the suspect, with the aim of wanting the suspect to accept and admit to the offense for the purpose of being remorseful for what he did.
