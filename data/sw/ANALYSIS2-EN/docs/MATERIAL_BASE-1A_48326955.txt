<1>	Simu ya Samsung yashindwa kuthibitisha ubora	Samsung fails to control phone quality.
<2>	Moja ya makampuni ambayo yanatajwa kuwa bora duniani kwa utengenezaji wa simu huwezi kuacha kuitaja kampuni ya Samsung ambayo makao makuu yake yapo Korea Kusini ambapo imekuwa ikitamba zaidi kwa bidhaa zake za Samsung S kutokana na ubora wake na jinsi zinavyouzika sokoni.	when naming the best companies in the world at manufacturing phones, you can't fail to mention Samsung, whose headquarters are in South Korea, where it has been boasting about more of its Samsung S products and their quality, and how they have been selling in the market.
<3>	Sasa pamoja na ubora huo mtandao mmoja ambao unahusika na habari za aina za simu imeripoti kuifanyia uchunguzi simu ya Samsung S7 Active kama ni kweli haiingizi maji lakini hali ikawa tofauti.	now with that standard in mind, one network which is involved in reporting news about phone types has conducted investigations on the phone type Samsung S7 Active to test whether it is truly water resistant, and found that it is not.
<4>	Imeelezwa kuwa simu hiyo iliwekwa katika tanki la maji la mita moja na nusu na baada ya kukaa kwa muda wa saa moja na nusu kioo cha simu hiyo kilishindwa kufanya kazi na kubadilika kuwa cha kijani.	it was explained that the phone was put inside a one and a half liter water tank and after staying there for one and a half hour, the phone's screen didn't work and turned green.
<5>	Baada Samsung kuulizwa kuhusu tatizo hilo walisema kuwa yawezekana simu iliyotumika katika jaribio hilo haikuwa imetengenezwa na mfumo wa kuzuia maji kuingia katika simu.	when Samsung was asked about the problem, they said that it is possible that the phone used in the experiment was not built with the system to prevent water from seeping into the phone.
