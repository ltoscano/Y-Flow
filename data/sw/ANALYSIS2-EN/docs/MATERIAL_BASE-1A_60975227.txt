<1>	NA MWANDISHI WETU, DAR ES SALAAM	by our writer, Dar es Salaam.
<2>	KWA miaka ya hivi karibuni kumekuwepo na malalamiko toka kwa wazazi,wadau,wanafunzi na hata serikali juu ya ufaulu usioridhisha wa wanafunzi wa kidato cha nne.	in recent years, there have been complaints from parents, stakeholders, students and even the government about disappointing performances from form four students.
<3>	Ufaulu huu usioridhisha unakaribia kukubalika katika jamii ya kitanzania kwani sababu zilizotolewa ni nyingi na hakuna dalili kuwa zinafanyiwa kazi.	this disappointing performance is more accepted in Tanzanian society because there are many reasons provided but there is no sign of any work being done on them.
<4>	Awali kulikuwa na viwango vinavyoeleweka katika ufaulu na hivyo mwanafunzi aliyepata chini ya hapo alihesabika kuwa amefeli na hakukuwa na namna nyingine zaidi ya kurudia darasa au kwenda shule za binafsi.	previously, there were understood standards in performance and so students who scored below that were counted failing and there were no other ways of repeating a class or going to a private school.
<5>	Lakini pia kabla ya kufikia hatua ya kufanya mtihani wa darasa la saba kila mwalimu mkuu na walimu wote wa darasa husika walifanya kila wawezalo kuhakikisha wanafunzi wanafaulu.	but also before getting to the point of sitting class seven exams, every head teacher and all concerned teachers did everything possible to ensure the students would pass.
<6>	Wajinga walikuwepo hata wasiojua kusoma na kuandika lakini walimu bado walikuwa na idadi kamili ya wanafunzi wao wanaowategemea katika mwaka huo.	there were idiots who didn't even know how to read and write, but teachers still had a full number of the students that depended on them during that year.
<7>	Hali hii ilianza kubadilika taratibu kuanzia mwaka 1995 zilipoanza kujengwa shule za sekondari katika maeneo ya vijijini na mitaani maarufu kama “shule za kata”.	this situation started changing slowly from 1995 when secondary schools began to be constructed in villages and neighborhoods which became known as ward schools.
<8>	Msisitizo wa ujenzi wa shule hizo ulishika kasi mwaka 2005 ambapo shule nyingi zilijengwa na idadi ya wanafunzi wanaochaguliwa kuingia kidato cha kwanza ikaongezeka kwa zaidi ya asilimia 200.	the insistence to construct these schools gained momentum in 2005 when many schools were built and the number of students selected to join form one went up by more than 200 percent.
<9>	Hapa ndipo neno ‘kufaulu’ lilibadilishwa na kuwa ‘kuchaguliwa’.	that is when the word 'succeed' was changed to 'selected'.
<10>	Kuna tofauti kati ya kufaulu na kuchaguliwa; anayefaulu ni lazima afikie viwango vilivyowekwa kwa mujibu wa matakwa ya hatua husika.	there is a difference between succeeding and being selected, the one who succeeds must attain the standards established according to the requirements of the measure concerned.
<11>	Kufaulu ni lazima ufanye kazi ya ziada badala ya kusubiri rehema za Mwenyezi Mungu.	to succeed, you must work do extra work instead of waiting for Almighty God's grace.
<12>	Tunapokuja kwenye neno kuchaguliwa; hapa kuna bahati, rehema za Mungu, mahitaji na kadhalika.	when we come to the word selected, here, there's luck, God's grace, needs and so forth.
<13>	Hapo ndipo kiwango chetu cha kufaulu kilipoanza kuporomoka kwani wanafunzi wanachaguliwa kujaza nafasi zilizopo hata kama hawakufaulu.	that is where our performance standards started deteriorating because students are selected to fill up available positions even if they didn't succeed.
<14>	Ujenzi wa shule za kata ulikuwa ni mpango mzuri lakini yapo maswali mengi ya kujiuliza.	the construction of ward schools was a good plan but there are many questions to ask.
<15>	Moja ya maswali hayo ni kwa nini hatukujenga shule kulingana na mahitaji ya ufaulu?	one of those questions is why we didn't build schools according to the performance requirements?
<16>	Lakini pia ni kwa nini tunawachukua wanafunzi wanaochaguliwa badala ya wanaofaulu?	and also why do we take students who have been selected instead of those who have passed?
<17>	Ukweli ni kuwa ufaulu haujapungua na wala idadi ya wanaofeli haijaongezeka kwani idadi ya waliokuwa wanafaulu mwaka 1994 ni sawa na waliofaulu mwaka 2014.	the truth is that success hasn't reduced, nor has the number of failures increased because the number of those who passed in 1994 is equal to those who passed in 2014.
<18>	Tofauti iliyopo kati ya mwaka 1995 na 2014 ni idadi tu ya watahiniwa ambao ndiyo hao wanaochaguliwa bila kufaulu.	the difference present between the year 1995 and 2014 is simply the number of candidates who were selected without passing.
<19>	Nionavyo mimi wanafunzi hawajafeli kwa sababu hawajawahi kufaulu mahala popote.	as I see it, these students have not failed, because they have never passed anywhere else.
<20>	Labda nitoe mfano kidogo unaonihusu mimi.	I should maybe give a small example that relates to me.
<21>	Machi mwaka 2011 nikiwa mwalimu katika moja ya shule hapa Dar es Salaam tuliwaandikia barua wazazi na walezi wote kuwa yeyote ambaye mtoto wake alichaguliwa na hajaripoti shule afike shuleni na mtoto wake au kama ameamua kumpeleka shule binafsi afike na uthibitisho vinginevyo atashtakiwa kwa mujibu wa sharia.	in March, 2011, when I was a teacher at a school here in Dar es Salaam, we wrote a letter to parents and all caregivers that anyone whose child had been selected but had not reported to the school with their child and confirmation letter on whether they had decided to take them private schools would be charged in accordance to the law.
<22>	Mzee mmoja mwenye umri zaidi ya miaka 60 alifika shuleni akiwa na mjukuu wake ambaye alichaguliwa kujiunga na shule yetu lakini alikuwa hajaripoti.	an over 60-year-old man came to school with his grandchild who had been selected to join our school but he hadn't reported it.
<23>	Mzee huyo alijitambulisha mbele yetu tukiwa walimu watatu na akauliza mara tatu kutaka kuthibitisha kama kweli sisi ni walimu.	that old man introduced himself in front of three of us and asked us thrice to confirm if we were actually teachers.
<24>	Tukamjibu sisi ni walimu, akatuuliza kama kweli tumesoma tukamjibu kuwa tumesoma.	we told him that we were teachers and he asked us if we are really educated and we told him we were.
