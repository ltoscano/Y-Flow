<1>	Imelda Myovela: Mwanamke pekee fundi wa umeme kiwanda cha TBL Arusha	Imelda Myovela: the only female electrical technician of TBL factory, Arusha.
<2>	â€œTatizo la ajira nchini limekuwa likiongezeka hapa nchini mwaka hadi mwaka ila wanawake wengi ndio hawana kazi wameachwa nyuma katika sekta zote kiasi kwamba kunahitajika ushawishi wa ziada wa kuwahimiza watoto wa kike nchini kuachana na kasumba ya kuchagua kaziâ€Anasema Imelda Myovela ,mfanyakazi wa kiwanda cha TBL Arusha ambaye ni mwanamke pekee fundi wa umeme.	"the problem of employment in the country has been increasing year after year, but many women who have no jobs have been left behind in all sectors to the extent that there is need for extra motivation to encourage female children in the country to leave the ideology of choosing jobs." says Imelda Myovela, an employee of TBL industry Arusha, who is the only female electrician.
<3>	Myovela anaendelea kueleza kuwa iwapo watoto wa kike hawatapata ushawishi wa kuwaeleza kuwa masomo yote wanayaweza wanapokuwa mashuleni na wana uwezo wa kufanya kazi yoyote inayofanywa na wanaume kuna hatari ya wanawake wa Tanzania kuendelea kubaki nyuma kwa kuachwa nje ya mfumo wa ajira.	Myovela goes on to explain that if girls are not convinced that they can handle any subject while at school and that they have the ability to do any work done by men, there is a risk of Tanzanian women continuing to lag behind by being left out of the employment system.
<4>	Alisema jambo la kusikitisha hata watoto wa kike wengi wanaosoma masomo ya ufundi mara nyingi wanabadilisha kazi na wengine kuamua kukaa bila kazi kwa kuogopa kufanya kazi walizosomea na hali hiyo ndio inasababisha kila sehemu ya kazi hususani za kawaida kuwa na idadi kubwa ya wafanyakazi wanaume.	she said that sadly, many girls who pursue technical studies many times change professions while others decide to remain unemployed for fear of undertaking the work they have studied for and this situation is the cause for every job sector, especially the ordinary ones, having a huge number of male workers.
<5>	Akielezea historia ya elimu yake Imelda anasema baada ya kuhitimu masomo yake ya sekondari mwanzoni mwa miaka yaÂ themanini alijiunga na Chuo cha VETA cha Dar es Salaam ambapo alisoma kozi ya ufundi wa umeme wa viwandani.	explaining the history of her education, Imelda says that after graduating from secondary school in the early eighties, she joined VETA college in Dar es Salaam where she took the course for industrial electrical technicians.

<7>	â€œKufanya kazi katika kampuni hii kumeniwezesha kuwa na ujuzi mkubwa katika fani hii ikizingatiwa kuwa kuna mafunzo mengi tunapata ambayo huwezi kuyapata chuoni pia kampuni imefunga mitambo ya kisasa na inayotumia teknolojia ya juu hivyo inahitaji uwe umebobea katika fani kwendana na mazingira ya kaziâ€.	working in this company has enabled me acquire a great deal of experience in this field, considering that there is much training we get that you cannot obtain in college. the company has also installed modern machines that use advanced technology, therefore, it requires you to be well versed in the field to fit in the work environment.

<9>	Aliongeza kwamba anajivunia kazi yake japo wenzake wote anaofanya nao kazi ni wanaume na anafurahi kuona anaimudu na anaaminiwa na mwajiri wake kama wanavyoaminiwa wafanyakazi wanaume.	she added that, she is proud of her work though all her colleagues whom she works with are men, and she is happy to see that she is managing and is trusted by her employer in the same manner the male employees are trusted.
<10>	Â Kuhusu changamoto anazokabiliana nazo katika kazi yake alisema zipo changamoto za kawaida kama zilizopo kwenye kazi nyingine .	concerning the challenges that she faces in her work, she said that there are ordinary challenges same as in any other job.
<11>	â€œHakuna kazi isiyokuwa na changamoto kwa kazi kama hii ya kwangu unapokuwa na watoto wadogo na kufanya kazi za shift unakuwa na wasiwasi hata hivyo namshukuru mme wangu ni muelewa amekuwa akinisaidia na kunitia moyoâ€.	there is no work that has no challenges like mine. when you have small children and work shifts, you get worried. nevertheless I thank my husband, he is understanding and has been helping and encouraging me.
<12>	Alisema	she said.
<13>	Imelda ambaye ni mama mwenye Â watoto watatu anasema kuwa anafurahi kufanya kazi katika kampuni kubwa ya TBL kwa kuwa ina mifumo mizuri ya ajira yenye maslahi mazuri ikiwemo taratibu za kuwapatia mafunzo ya mara kwa mara wafanyakazi wakeÂ na anakiri kuwa ajira yake imemwezesha kupata mafanikio kimaisha mojawapo ikiwa ni kuwasomesha watoto wake kwenye shule nzuri .	Imelda, who is the mother of three, says that she is happy working at the big company TBL because it has good employment systems with good terms including a regular program of training for its employees and she admits that her job has made her succeed in life, one of them being educating her children at a good school.
<14>	â€œKwenye kampuni kama hizi Â tunafundishwa mambo mengi ambayo hata yanakunufaisha ukiwa nyumbani kwako kama vile usafi wa mazingira pia kupanga bajeti kwa kila kitu unachofanyaâ€.	in companies like these, we are taught many things that even benefit you while you are at your own home like the cleanliness of the environment also to plan a budget for everything that you do.

<17>	Â Alimalizia kwa kuwataka akina mama wajitokeze na kujiamini kufanya kazi zote bila kuchagua kwa kuwa hakuna kazi kwa ajili ya wanaume peke yao au wanawake peke yao na hakua kazi rahisi kila kazi ina changamoto zake.	she concluded by urging women to come out and believe in themselves to do every job without selecting because there is no work meant for men only or women only and there is no easy job, every job has its own challenges.
<18>	â€œAkina mama tuamke na watoto wa kike changamkieniÂ masomo ya ufundi ili muweze kupata ajira nzuri zitakazowawezesha kuboresha maisha yenuâ€.	mothers let us rise and girls go for technical studies in order to get good employment that will enable you improve your standards of living.
