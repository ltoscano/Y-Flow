<1>	Ukubwa, ubabe na utata wa Shell	the might, brutality and controversies of Shell
<2>	Oct 02, 2013	October 02, 2013
<3>	KUFAHAMU ukubwa wa kampuni ya mafuta ya Royal Dutch Shell ambayo inaonekana itapewa mkataba wa kutafuta na kuchimba mafuta visiwani Zanzibar, ni vema kufahamu kwamba mwaka jana ilipata mapato ambayo ni takribani mara 30 ya mapato iliyopata kampuni kubwa zaidi ya dhahabu duniani, Barrick Gold.	to know the might of Royal Dutch Shell which seemingly will be given a contract to explore and extract oil in Zanzibar, it is good to know that last year it had an income almost 30 times the income of the largest gold company in the world, Barrick Gold.
<4>	Barrick ndiyo ambao wanamiliki migodi yote mikubwa ya madini ya dhahabu Tanzania na barani Afrika kwa ujumla.	Barrick are the owners of all large gold mines in Tanzania and in Africa in general.
<5>	Popote ambapo kuna dhahabu nyingi, kampuni hii ya Canada ipo.	wherever there is a lot of gold, this Canadian company is there.
<6>	Hii ndiyo kampuni ambayo iliwahi kutaka kumzuia aliyekuwa Waziri wa Mambo ya Ndani, Hamis Kagasheki, asiingie katika mojawapo ya migodi yao mkoani Mara.	this is the company that once wanted to obstruct former minister for local affairs, Hamis Kagasheki, from getting into one of their gold mines in the Mara province.
<7>	Barrick ndiyo kampuni ambayo iliwahi kumwaga maji yenye madini ya zebaki katika mto Tigithe wilayani Tarime na kusababisha vifo na matatizo ya kiafya kwa viumbe hai, wakiwamo binadamu na wanyama, vilivyotumia maji hayo na hakuna aliyewafanya kitu.	Barrick is the company that once poured water with mercury into the river Tigithe in the Tarime district which resulted in deaths and health problems to many living creatures including humans and animals that used the waters though no one did anything to them.
<8>	Lakini, kwa jeuri yote ambayo Barrick wanayo, hawafui dafu kwa Shell.	but for all the rudeness Barrick have, they cannot beat Shell.
<9>	Kama ilikuwa vigumu kupambana na Barrick kwa namna yoyote ile, itakuwa vigumu mara 30 kupambana na Shell kutokana na nguvu ya kiuchumi na historia ambayo tayari imejijengea.	if it was difficult to deal with Barrick in any way, it will be 30 times harder to deal with Shell because of the economic might and history they have already built themselves.
<10>	Ukubwa wa Shell	the greatness of Shell
<11>	Januari mwaka huu, jarida maarufu la masuala ya kiuchumi la Marekani la Forbes, lilitoa orodha ya makampuni 500 makubwa zaidi duniani na kampuni hii inayotarajiwa kuja kuwekeza hapa nchini (kama Tanzania na Zanzibar zitabaki kuwa nchi moja), iliibuka namba moja.	in January this year, the American economic magazine, Forbes, listed 500 greatest companies in the world and this company, which expects to come and invest here in the country (if Tanzania and Zanzibar will remain to be one country), emerged number one.
<12>	Fikiria kampuni yoyote kubwa unayoifahamu hapa duniani lakini bado itakuwa iko chini ya Shell.	think of any big company you know in the world but it will still be under Shell.
<13>	Kueleza namna mapato ya Shell yalivyokuwa ya kushangaza, kiasi ilichoingiza kwa hesabu za Januari mwaka huu kilikuwa sawa na asilimia 84 ya kile kinachokusanywa na serikali ya Uholanzi (nchi iliyoendelea).	to explain how Shell's income was surprising, the amount it made in the account of January this year was equal to 84 percent of that collected by Holland's government (a developed country).
<14>	Kampuni hii inafanya shughuli zote zinazohusiana na biashara ya mafuta na gesi.	this company does everything related oil and gas business.
<15>	Inatafuta mafuta na gesi, inachimba, inasafisha mafuta, inauza, inasambaza na kufanya mambo yote yaliyo katika mnyororo wa shughuli za bidhaa hiyo iliyopachikwa jina la dhahabu nyeusi.	it explores for oil and gas, it extracts, refines, sells, supplies it and does all the things in the chain of activities for the product that has been branded as black gold.
<16>	Ina matawi katika nchi 90 tofauti duniani kote na ina vituo zaidi ya 44,000 katika nchi hizo â€“Ikiwa imeajiri wafanyakazi zaidi ya 87,000.	it has branches in 90 different countries in the whole world and more than 44,000 stations in those countries, having employed more than 87,000 employees.
<17>	Bila shaka, hii ndiyo kampuni kubwa zaidi kuwahi kufanya biashara yoyote hapa Tanzania.	no doubt, this is the largest company to ever conduct any business here in Tanzania.
<18>	Ubabe	brutality
<19>	Mwanzoni mwa mwaka 1996, wanaharakati walianza kutoa ripoti na taarifa mbalimbali zilizoihusisha kampuni hii na vitendo vya mauaji, utesaji, ukiukwaji wa haki za binadamu na maovu mengine nchini Nigeria.	in early 1996, activists started giving multiple reports and news involving this company about acts of murder, torture, human rights violation and other evils in Nigeria.
<20>	Shell ambayo ilikuwa inafanya biashara zake katika eneo nyeti la Delta ya Nigeria lenye utajiri mkubwa wa mafuta, ilidaiwa kushiriki katika mipango ya kuua wana harakati wote waliokuwa wakipinga shughuli zake.	Shell, which was doing its business in the critical regions of the Nigerian Delta with large oil surplus, was claimed to participate in the plans of killing all the activists who were against its activities.
<21>	Miongoni mwa wahanga wa vitendo hivi alikuwa ni Ken Saro-Wiwa ambaye aliuawa na utawala wa kijeshi wa hayati Jenerali Sani Abacha, kutokana na kupinga kwake shughuli za Shell.	among the martyrs of these acts is Ken Saro-Wiwa who was killed in the military reign of General Sani Abacha as a result of his disapproval of Shell.
<22>	Shell ilishutumiwa kwa kushirikiana na serikali katika mauaji hayo ya Saro Wiwa na viongozi wengine wanane wa kabila la Ogoni na ingawa imekuwa ikikana kuhusika kwa namna yoyote ile, ililipa dola milioni 15 ili suala hilo limalizwe nje ya mahakama mwaka 2009.	Shell was accused of cooperating with the government in the murder of Saro-Wiwa and other eight leaders of the Ogoni tribe and although they have been denying being involved, by all means, it paid 15 million dollars so that the matter be finished outside the court in the year 2009.
<23>	Kampuni hii inatajwa sana kuhusika na uchafuzi mkubwa wa mazingira katika maeneo inakofanya shughuli zake.	this company is mentioned a lot for taking part in lots of environmental pollution in the regions where it does its business.
<24>	Mifano inatolewa kuhusu hali mbaya ya kimazingira iliyopo katika eneo la Delta ya Nigeria na tukio moja la kusikitisha mwaka 1999.	examples are given about the bad environmental state the Delta region of Nigeria is in and one saddening incident in 1999.
<25>	Katika mji mmoja uitwao Magdalena nchini Argentina, matenki ya mafuta ya Shell yalidaiwa kumwaga mafuta machafu katika mojawapo ya maziwa yaliyopo nchini humo na kusababisha uchafuzi mkubwa zaidi wa maji masafi kuwahi kufanywa tangu dunia ilipoumbwa.	in a town called Magdalena in Argentina, Shell fuel tankers were claimed to have poured contaminated oil in one of the lakes in the country causing the biggest pollution of clean water that has ever occurred since the creation of the earth.
<26>	Utata	controversy
<27>	Utata umekuwa ukiigubika kampuni hii katika ufanyaji wake wa kazi.	controversy has been engulfing this company in its undertakings.
<28>	Kuna tuhuma kwamba mara zote Shell hujiingiza katika mahusiano yasiyo mazuri na serikali zilizo madarakani ili ijihakikishie kuendelea na shughuli zake.	there are accusations that Shell gets into bad relationships all the times with the governments in power in order to continue its businesses.
<29>	Kwa mfano, Shell inadaiwa kupenyeza vibaraka wake katika ofisi zote nyeti za serikali ya Serikali pamoja na jeshi la nchi hiyo ili kuhakikisha inafahamu kila kinachoendelea serikalini kila siku.	for example, Shell is claimed to have lackeys in all critical offices of the government together with the military of the country so that it knows what goes on in the government everyday.
<30>	Kuna madai yasiyothibitishwa kwamba kampuni hiyo imekuwa miongoni mwa wafadhili wa Tume ya Uchaguzi ya Nigeria inayosimamia chaguzi zote za nchi hiyo.	there are unconfirmed claims that the company has been among the facilitators of the Nigerian electoral commission which heads all elections in that country.
<31>	Kuna wanaotania kwamba Shell ndiyo huwa inaamua nani atakuwa Rais wa Nigeria na nchi zote nyingine ambako inafanya biashara vizuri.	there are some who joke around that Shell decides who should be the Nigerian president and other countries where it does business properly.
<32>	Miaka michache, Shell iliingia katika kashfa baada ya kubainika kwamba ilimpa aliyekuwa mgombea wa nafasi ya Ugavana wa Jimbo la Pennslyvania nchini Marekani, Tom Corbett, kiasi cha dola za Marekani 300,000 ili akipata fursa hiyo awapunguzie kodi.	a few years, Shell got into a scandal after it was determined that it gave the Pennsylvania Gubernatorial aspirant in America, Tom Corbett, an amount of 300,000 American dollars so that when he gets the opportunity he reduce their tax.
<33>	Kwa vyovyote vile, Tanzania (Zanzibar?) imeingia katika hatua nzito kwa kukubali kuingia kwenye makubaliano na Shell.	whatsoever, Tanzania (Zanzibar?) has gotten into a serious step of acceptance to get into an agreement with Shell.
