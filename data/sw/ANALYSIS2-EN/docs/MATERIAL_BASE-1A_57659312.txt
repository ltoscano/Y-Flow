<1>	(0.000-6.033)	ha- -- hao wamekuwa sio msaada sana kwenye -- kwenye -- katika michano kama hii au katika hatua kama hizi za michuano kama hii ya kimataifa .	-- they have not been of much help on -- on -- in matches these kind of matches or in these kind of stages in these kind of international championships .
<2>	(6.033-7.038)	wamekuwa sio msaada .	they have not been helpful .
<3>	(7.038-8.090)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<4>	(8.090-11.145)	au ni si mwarubaini sasa kutibu matatizo kama hayo .	or not at the moment it's now treating such problems .
<5>	(11.145-18.669)	tuchukue kwa mfano kama Azam (()) mtu wa kigeni kwenye -- kwenye kilabu yao labda wewe ungetarajia kwamba tungeweza kufika mbali kwa mchuano kama hii ya vilabu .	let's take for example like Azam (()) foreign people on -- on their club may be you may have expected that we would have reached far in clubs championship like this .
<6>	(18.669-19.720)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<7>	(19.720-31.077)	<hes> kuwa msaada au si msaada hasa ni kutokana na hali ya -- ya -- ya -- ya usajili lakini kwanza moja tutambue kwamba kuwepo kwa wachezaji wa kigeni sijambo baya .	to be helpful or not especially is as a result of status of registration but first one we recognize that the presence of foreign players is not a bad thing .
<8>	(31.077-42.847)	ni jambo nzuri (()) inaleta changamoto kwa wachezaji wetu tena wanaweza kujifunza kuna vitu kutoka (()) lakini tunaangalia je kuna aina ya wachezaji ambao vilabu vyetu vya hapa vinachukua .	it is a good thing (()) it challenges our players and again they can learn that there are things from (()) but we are checking out if there are types of players that our clubs here are taking .
<9>	(42.847-50.616)	Yanga Azam Simba ambavyo tunatoa mfano hivyo kwa sababu ndivyo vilabu ambavyo vimejikita (()) kuchukua kuwa na wachezaji wa kutoka nje .	Yanga Azam and Simba that we offer as examples because they are the clubs that are established (()) to take foreign players .
<10>	(50.616-52.648)	ni wachezaji (()) kweli .	are players (()) truly .
<11>	(52.648-63.220)	ni aina ya wachezaji ambao ni wenye kuleta mafanikio wenye ushindani au ni aina tu ya wachezaji unaowachukua ilimradi kuwa na jina kwamba kuna mchezaji kutoka nje .	are they the types of players that bring competitive success or are they the types of players you would take for the sake of having a player from outside .
<12>	(63.220-63.770)	unaona ?	you see ?
<13>	(63.770-69.145)	hili linatakiwa kutazamwa na uongozi wa vilabu pale wanapofikia dhamira hiyo .	this need to be examined by the leaderships of the clubs when they fulfill that desire .
<14>	(69.145-78.378)	kwa maana kwamba sasa vilabu pia viongozi wasiwe wao ndiyo wenye kuchukua au kwenda kutafuta -- jukumu hili ni la ufundi makocha .	meaning that now clubs as well as leaders should not be the ones signing or going to search -- this is the responsibility of technical coaches .
<15>	(78.378-86.843)	kwa sababu pia inafika mahala (()) makocha nao wanalalamika kwamba wanachaguliwa wachezaji au wanasajiliwa wachezaji .	because it also reaches a situation (()) the coaches also complaining that the players are being selected for them or the players are being registered for them .
<16>	(86.843-96.590)	kwa sababu tumeshuhudia wachezaji wengi katika vilabu vyetu wakati mwingine wanakuja wamesajiliwa makocha hawapo halafu kocha anabadilishwa analetwa kocha mwingine wakati ambapo usajili hakuwepo .	because we have witnessed many players in our clubs sometimes come having been registered by absent coaches then the coach is changed another coach is brought at the time when there is no signing .
<17>	(96.590-107.006)	kwa hiyo utakuta kwamba kocha anakuja anakutana na wachezaji ambao tayari wamesajiliwa na viongozi na viongozi si wataalam wa -- wa -- wa -- wa ufundi kujua aina gani ya mchezaji ambaye wanamtaka au anatakiwa .	therefore you will find that a coach comes and meets with players who have been already signed by leaders and the leaders are not technical experts to know the type of players that they want or is wanted .
<18>	(107.006-111.950)	sasa hili ni tatizo ambalo wakati mwingine wachezaji wanaletwa wanapata lawama .	now this is a problem that sometimes players that are brought get criticism .
<19>	(111.950-114.398)	tumeweza hata kusikia juzi hata .	even we have been able to hear even recently .
<20>	(114.398-125.855)	kiongozi mkuu wa Simba Rais Aveva akisema kwamba (()) eh alichuuzwa kwa maana kwamba kuondoka Simba kwenda Yanga .	the chief leader of Simba president Aveva said that (()) yes he was sold to leave Simba to go to Yanga .
<21>	(125.855-126.466)	unaona ?	you see ?
<22>	(126.466-134.600)	kwa maana kwamba wanaona kwamba alikuwa mchezaji muhimu kwao lakini baadaye wakaona si muhimu akaondoka akaenda upande wa pili kwa upande A pili anafanya mambo yuko vizuri unaona ?	meaning that they can see that he was their important player but later they saw that he was not important then he left for the second side on the second side A he is doing well you see ?
<23>	(134.600-137.627)	sasa majuto ni mjukuu baadaye pia anakuja anaridhika .	now regrets come after later he also becomes satisfied .
<24>	(137.627-147.700)	sasa je pia unaangalia (()) huko alikotoka uongozi wa Simba wa nyuma eventually wafundi la Simba walimchukua mpaka kumleta hapa walikuwa na dhamira gani nawe we ulikuwa na mtazamo gani ?	now if you are also looking (()) where he came from in the past Simba leadership eventually Simba technicians took him and brought him here what intention did they have and what is your view ?
<25>	(147.700-152.358)	sasa haya ni mambo ambayo wakati mwingine (()) kati ya uongozi na benchi la ufundi .	these are now the issues that sometimes (()) between the leadership and the technical bench .
<26>	(152.358-162.518)	kule uongozi wanasema kwamba kocha aliondoka usiku Patrick Piuli ndiye ambaye aliwasababisha kuondoka (()) kuonyesha kwamba si mchezaji aliyefaa katika kilabu yake .	there the leadership they say that the coach that left at night it was Patrick Piuli who caused his exit (()) to show that he was not a player that was fit for his club .
<27>	(162.518-177.189)	sasa hapa panakuwa na tatizo katika uongozi mawasiliano na benchi la ufundi na pengine kwenye ushauri kwamba nini kifanyike sasa kwa wachezaji ambao wanatoka nje mimi naona kwamba kuna wale (()) na kuna wale ambao hawafai kwa vilabu vyetu .	now here the problem becomes in the leadership communication and the technical bench and on the advice that what happens now to the foreign players I see that there are some (()) and there are some that are not fit for our clubs .
<28>	(177.189-188.774)	kwa hiyo ifike mahala vilabu vitambue au vione ni aina gani ya wachezaji ambao wanafaa kuja kucheza vilabu hivi na wakaviletea mafanikio kutoka nje na hata wale wachezaji wa ndani pasi tu kusajili .	therefore the situation reaches that the clubs recognize or see the type of players that should come to play in these clubs and bring success from outside and even those local players without just signing .
<29>	(188.774-206.004)	sasa matokeo yake ndiyo haya tunapoingia katika michuano ya vilabu mnaondoka katika ligi ya nyumbani mnafanya vizuri mnapata nafasi mnakwenda katika michuano ya vilabu barani Africa timu haifanyi vizuri wachezaji wanaonekana (()) lakini wako ambao wanaleta mafanikio na wale ambao hawaleti mafanikio sasa hapa wanapaswa kufanya nini kutazama .	now these are its results as we go into the clubs' championships you move from local leagues where you do well and get a chance to go into African continent clubs' championships where teams perform poorly the players seem (()) but there are those who bring success and those who don't bring success now what are they supposed to watch out for here .
<30>	(206.004-220.306)	lakini Moyo kuna kimoja hiki ambacho wanakisema <hes> unapokuwa na ligi bora unakuwa huna shaka hata na vilabu vyako na hata timu ya taifa tuchukulie mfano kama Misri .	but courage there is this one that they say when you are with the best league you become confident with even its clubs and even national team let's take an example of Egypt .
<31>	(220.306-224.970)	Misri ligi yao kabla ya machafukochafuko yao wenyewe kwa wenyewe walikuwa na ligi imara kweli .	Egypt's league before the civil unrest they had a really strong league .
<32>	(224.970-232.639)	na tukaona mfano mzuri hata kuchukua kombe la Kitaifa Africa (()) mara sa- -- mara saba wamechukua hili kombe kwa sababu kwanza wana mfumo mzuri wa ligi .	and we saw a good example even taking the Cup of African Nations (()) times -- seven times they have taken this cup because first they have a good league system .
<33>	(232.639-233.905)	ligi ina ushindani kweli kweli .	the league is really competitive .
<34>	(233.905-238.840)	yaani ligi inaanza unashindwa kubashiri nani ambaye anaweza akachukua ubingwa safari hii .	that is the league starts and you fail to predict who can take the championship this time round .
<35>	(238.840-246.094)	sasa ligi yetu ya nyumbani unaweza ukakaa ukabashiri kwamba msimu huu anachukua Yanga Yanga kweli wakachukua ndoo .	now our local league you can sit and predict that this season Yanga is taking it and yes Yanga takes it .
<36>	(246.094-255.115)	au msimu huu wanachukua Simba Simba wakachukua ndoo au msimu huu wanachukua Azam nini vyama vitatu tu hivyo ambavyo vinapokezana vijiti katika mfumo wetu wa ligi .	or this season Simba are taking it and yes Simba takes it or this season Azam are taking what just those three parties that hand each other the baton in this our league system .
<37>	(255.115-259.130)	yaani Simba Azam Yanga -- Simba Azam haya ni hawa tu .	that is just Simba Azam Yanga Simba Azam .
<38>	(259.130-270.360)	lakini inge- -- ingekuwa tuna ligi ambalo unasema aai safari hii ni gamble anatuwakilisha Tanzania katika mchuano wa ligi ya mabingwa au (()) United safari hii inachukua bingwa <breath> tunaamini ligi ingekuwa -- tungekuwa na -- tungekuwa na timu zenye ushindani sana .	but -- if we had a league that you say no this time round it's a gamble that is representing us in Tanzania in the African champions league competition or (()) United that is taking the championship this time round we believe the league would be -- we would have had very competitive teams .
<39>	(270.360-279.301)	lakini unapokuwa na ligi legelege hivi au mfano kama vile vilabu vitatu sasa hivi kama vyombo teka kwamba wao ndiyo watakuwa <breath> wanapokezana vijiti kwenye ligi .	but when you have a weak league this way or example now like those three teams are like scooping tools that it's them that will be handing each other the sticks in the league .
<40>	(279.301-283.800)	tuna tegemeo lolote nzuri kwenye michuano ya Kitaifa kwenye vilabu vyetu hivi ?	do we have any good expectation on the international championships on these our clubs ?
<41>	(283.800-284.959)	kwa shindano ya aina hii ?	from a competition like this ?
<42>	(284.959-302.012)	kwa ushindano ya namna hii kwanza (()) anavyosema kwamba ni -- kwanza ni kasoro eh lakini huwezi kuvihukumu kwamba kwa nini Azam wawe bingwa au kwa nini Yangawawe bingwa au kwa nini Simba wawe hatu- -- hatuwezi kuvihukumu kwa sababu pia unaangalia uchumi wao ukoje ?	in a competition like this first (()) as he says that it is -- first it is wrong yes but you cannot judge them that why should Azam become champions or why should Yanga become champions or why should Simba become -- we cannot judge them because you also look at how their economy is ?
<43>	(302.012-303.020)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<44>	(303.020-305.661)	eh uchumi wao kwanza ukoje kwa hizi kilabu ?	yes how is their economy first in these clubs ?
<45>	(305.661-310.147)	hizi kilabu tatu ndizo ambazo tunaweza sema ni kilabu ambazo zinajiweza .	these three clubs are the ones that we can say are self-reliable clubs .
<46>	(310.147-316.390)	eh ambazo zina fedha za udhamini eh wa ligi kuu wanazozipata .	yes that have sponsorship money yeah of major league that they get .
<47>	(316.390-334.950)	lakini bado vina vyanzo vingine na pia mapato yao ni mazuri hata milangoni katika mechi zao wanazocheza kwa hiyo vinaweza kusaidia sasa wale wanaweza kutokana na hali ya uchumi walioko nayo tunaashiria wanaweza kwenda lakini bado kwa maana kusema ligi yetu tatizo ni kwamba inabaki ligi ya farasi watatu .	but still they have other means and also their good earnings even at the gate in their games they play therefore can help them now those that can according to their economic status that they have we indicate that they can but still meaning to say that the problem of our league is that it remains to be a three-horse league .
<48>	(334.950-335.914)	eh .	yes .
<49>	(335.914-353.265)	ukiondoa maanake wakati huu kulikuwa na wawili Simba na Yanga kuna wakati mmoja vilikuja vilabu kwa sababu ukiangalia hata historia ya ligi ya mwaka -- tangu mwaka elfu moja mia tisa na sitini na tano ilipoanzishwa eh kulikuwa na kilabu kama Cosmopolitan ikapotea kulikuwa na kilabu Mseto iliwekwa bingwa ikapotea <breath> kulikuwa na Panafrica ikapotea <sta> unaona .	if you remove its meaning now there were two Simba and Yanga there was one time there came clubs because if you look at even the history of the league of the year -- since the year nineteen sixty-five when it was started yes there was a club like Cosmopolitan then disappeared there was the club Mseto that was made champions then disappeared there was Pan-Africa then disappeared you see .
<50>	(353.265-366.435)	ikaja katikati hapa wakatenganishwa wakati mmoja aliingia (()) Stars akapotea baadaye tena alikuja kuwatenganisha katika ubingwa huu Watanzania bara <breath> walitokea Coastal Union halafu walikuja mara ya mwisho wakaja kutokea Mtibwa mpaka akaja Azam .	then came in the middle here they were separated at one time he entered (()) Stars then he disappeared later again he came separated them in this championship rural Tanzanians came from Coastal Union then they came for the last time then they came to appear in Mtibwa until he came to Azam .
<51>	(366.435-374.423)	sasa ukiangalia ni kwamba Azam sasa ndiyo amekuwa analeta ushindani kwa hivi vilabu viwili vya Simba na Yanga ambavyo ndiyo vilikuwa vinapokezana ubingwa .	now when you see that Azam is who has been bringing competition now to this two clubs of Simba and Yanga that used to be give each other championship .
<52>	(374.423-381.618)	lakini kuingia kwa Azam pia bado hakuonyeshi kwamba mafanikio katika ligi yetu kwamba iko .	but the entry of Azam does not show that there is success in this our league .
<53>	(381.618-386.779)	sasa ligi yetu pia ukitazama timu nyingi zimekuwa ni kama wasindikizaji wa ligi .	now if you look at our our league many teams have also become escorts to leagues .
<54>	(386.779-391.790)	eh zinaingia zinasindikiza zinaacha hizi timu tatu zitawale pale juu na zitaendelea kutawala .	yes they enter then accompany leaving these three teams to dominate up there and they will continue dominating .
<55>	(391.790-406.086)	kwa hiyo bado hatuwezi kusema kwamba ni ligi bora <breath> ambayo inaweza ikatupa ushindani bora kutokana na aina kwa sababu pale ushindani unaonekana uko kwa timu tatu zinapokutana na mechi zao unaziona <breath> rekodi zinaonyesha ndiyo kunakuwa na ushindani kila wakati .	we still therefore cannot say that it's a good league that can give us good success from the types because the success seems to be in three teams when they meet and you see the records they show that is why there is success all the time .
<56>	(406.086-417.929)	sasa huku kwingine hakuna sasa tungekuwa na ligi ambayo ina kilabu au ina timu ambazo zinashindana kila zinapokutana kila aina ya timu basi <breath> tungekuwa tunatarajia kuwa tunapata yaani kwamba bingwa ambaye hajulikani ni nani .	now this other side there is not now if we had a league that have a club or a teams that compete whenever they meet any type of team then we would be expecting to be getting that is a champion that is not known is which .
<57>	(417.929-431.661)	eh bingwa ambaye hajulikani ni nani lakini kila msimu inakwenda ligi inaanza lakini baadaye unapoelekea karibu na katikati ya msimu au ukingoni inapobaki robo eh (()) wanatabiri kabisa wanaanza kuona kwamba nani msimu huu anaweza kuwa bingwa .	yes a champion that is not known is which but every season goes the league begins but later as it continues near the middle of the season or towards the end when a quarter remain yeah (()) they predict fully they start to see that who this season can be the champion .
<58>	(431.661-438.220)	kwa hiyo tungetazama katika ligi nadhani kwamba ifike mahala hata vilabu vingine viweze kushiriki katika ligi .	therefore we would watch in the league I imagine that it reach a place that even other clubs be able to participate in the league .
<59>	(438.220-442.008)	vionyeshe dhamira vionyeshe ushindani tusiwe vilabu ambavyo vinasindikiza tu .	they show the intentions they show competitiveness we should not be clubs that just accompany .
<60>	(442.008-453.594)	vionyeshe kwamba ni vilabu vinataka kuwa washindani katika ligi na kuwa washindi kama si bingwa basi nafasi ya pili kuwakilisha nchi katika michuano ya vilabu barani Africa .	they should show that they are clubs that want to be competitors in the league and become winners if not champions and then the second position to represent the country in the African clubs continental championships .
