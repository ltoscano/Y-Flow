<5>	Mkumbo ambaye ni mkazi wa Tegeta jijini Dar es Salaam, alipandishwa kizimbani jana na alisomewa mashtaka hayo mbele ya Hakimu Agripinas Kimanze kutoka kwa Mwendesha Mashitaka wa Serikali, Sunday Hyera, akisaidiana na Ediga Bantulaki.	Mkumbo, who is a resident of Tegeta in Dar es Salaam, was put in the dock yesterday and the charges were read to him in front of Judge Agripinas Kimanze by the government prosecutor, Sunday Hyera, assisted by Ediga Bantulaki.
<6>	Kwa mujibu wa waendesha mashitaka hao wa serikali, mshitakiwa huyo anakabiliwa na kesi mbili, ya kwanza ikiwa ni kesi ya jinai kwa mujibu wa Kifungu cha 226 ya mwaka 2016 na ya pili ni kesi ya Usalama Barabarani kwa mujibu wa Kifungu cha 222.	according to the government prosecutors, the accused is facing two charges, the first being a criminal case according to Article 226 of the year 2016, and the second being a road safety case according to Article 222.
<7>	Mtuhumiwa huyo anadaiwa kutenda kosa hilo Oktoba 15, mwaka huu eneo la Mkambarani wilaya ya Morogoro katika barabara kuu ya Morogoro- Dar es Salaam wakati akiendesha gari aina ya Toyota Pajero lenye namba za usajili T 845 CTJ.	the accused is alleged to have committed the offense on October 15 this year, in the Mkambarani areaof the Morogoro district, along the Morogoro - Dar es Salaam highway, while driving a Toyota Pajero car with registration number T 845 CTJ.
<8>	Kosa la kwanza linalomkabili Mkurugenzi Mtendaji huyo ni kujaribu kumtishia kumuua kwa bastola askari aliyejulikana kwa jina la Koplo Titunda, akiwa katika majukumu yake ya kikazi.	the first charge facing the executive director is threatening with a gun to murder the officer known by the name of Corporal Titunda who was undertaking his duties.
<9>	Makosa mengine ni kuendesha gari lenye namba T845 CTJ aina ya Toyota Pajero bila ya kuwa na leseni na kuendesha gari bila bima.	the other charges are driving a Toyota Pajero with registraion number T845 CTJ without a license and driving the car without insurance.
<10>	Hyera alidai kuwa makosa mengine ni mwendo kasi katika eneo lililoruhusiwa kuendesha mwendo wa spidi 50 kwa saa lakini alivuka na kufikia 85, kugoma kupeleka gari kituo cha Polisi na kuendesha bila uangalifu barabarani.	Hyera claimed that the other offenses were driving at high speed in an area with the permitted speed of 50 per hour which he exceeded, reaching up to 85, refusing to take his car to the police station, and reckless driving on the road.
<11>	Mshitakiwa huyo alikana makosa hayo na kuachiwa kwa dhamana, huku kesi yake ikitarajiwa kufikishwa tena mahakamani Oktoba 31, mwaka huu.	the accused denied the offenses and was released on bond, while his case is expected to be brought again to court on October 31 this year.
<12>	Hata hivyo, jitihada za waandishi wa habari kupata picha halisi ya mtuhumiwa, hazikufanikiwa baada ya askari kumziba mtuhumiwa kwa koti pamoja na kofia aina ya pama na kumuingiza katika gari aina ya Toyota na kuondoka.	however, efforts by journalists to get an official photo of the accused were futile, after the police blocked the accused using a coat together with a Puma cap, and putting him into a Toyota car and departing.
