<5>	Kaimu Mkurugenzi wa Sheria na uanachama wa Shirikisho la Soka Tanzania (TFF), Eliud Mvela aliiambia HabariLeo jana kuwa wamemuandikia El Maamry ili akutane na pande hizo mbili kumaliza suala hilo.	the acting legal director and member of the Tanzania Football Federation, Eliud Mvela, told News Today yesterday that they have written to El Maamry to meet with both sides in order to end that issue.
<6>	Kikao hicho kati ya El Maamry na viongozi wa Simba na Yanga kinatarajiwa kukutana keshokutwa.	the session between El Maamry and the leaders of Simba and Yanga is expected to occur the day after tomorrow.
<7>	“Tumewasiliana na El Maamry na Jumamosi (keshokutwa) atakutana na Simba na Yanga ili kumaliza utata wa suala hilo, ikishindikana Kamati ya sheria na Hadhi ya Wachezaji itatoa maamuzi yake ambayo yapo ‘pending’,” alisema Mvela.	"we have communicated with El Maamry and on Saturday (the day after tomorrow), he will meet with Simba and Yanga to end the controversy around the issue. if it becomes impossible, the legal committee for the status of players will give its decision which is currently pending," said Mvela.
<8>	Alisema katika kikao cha mwisho Simba na Yanga walikubaliana kuwaomba mawakili Said El Maamry na Profesa Mgongo Fimbo kuwasimamia katika kikao cha kutafuta suluhisho la suala hilo.	he said in the last sitting, Simba and Yanga agreed to request that the lawyers, Said El Maamry and Professor Mgongo Fimbo, represent them in the session to find a solution for the issue.
<9>	Hata hivyo, Kamati ya Sheria na Hadhi ya Wachezaji chini ya Wakili Richard Sinamtwa ilikutana Septemba 24 iliwapa mahasimu hao siku tatu za kukaa na kumaliza suala hilo, hatua ambayo ilifikiwa baada ya mjadala mrefu kuhusu kesi mbili zilizofunguliwa na Simba mbele ya kamati hiyo.	however, the legal committee for the status of players under the lawyer, Richard Sinamtwa, met on September 24th and gave the opponents three days to sit and end the issue, a step that was reached after a long discussion about two cases that were opened by Simba in front of the committee.
<10>	Kesi hizo ni Yanga kudaiwa kuingia mkataba na Kessy wakati bado ana mkataba na Simba na ya pili ni mchezaji huyo kudaiwa kuanza kufanya mazoezi na timu hiyo pia kusajili Yanga na kwenda nje ya nchi wakati akiwa ndani ya mkataba klabu yake hiyo ya zamani.	those cases contain claims that Yanga started a contract with Kessy while he still had a contract with Simba and the second claim is that the player started to practice with the team and also signed up with Yanga, going out of the country while he was still under contract with his old club.
<11>	Wakati inatoa agizo la kuzitaka klabu hizo zimalizane zenyewe, Kamati ya Katiba, Sheria na Hadhi za Wachezaji ilisema kama hawatafikia mwafaka, mashauri hayo yatarudi mbele ya kamati na kufanya uamuzi kwa mujibu wa taratibu, kanuni na sheria zinazoongoza mpira wa miguu Tanzania.	after giving the order for the clubs to conclude the issue by themselves, the legal committee on the status of players said if they do not find an agreement, the counsel will go back to the committee to make a decision according to the procedures, regulations and laws guiding football in Tanzania.
<12>	Katika madai yake, Simba inataka ilipwe dola za Marekani 600,000 (zaidi ya Sh bilioni 1.2).	in its claims, Simba wants to be paid 600,000 American dollars (more than 1.2 billion shillings).
