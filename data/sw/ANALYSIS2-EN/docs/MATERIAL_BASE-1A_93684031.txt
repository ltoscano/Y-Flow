<4>	KOCHA Mkuu wa Stand United ya Shinyanga, Patrick Liewig ameutupia lawama uongozi wa timu hiyo kwa kutoonesha ushirikiano wa kumsaidia kupata kibali cha kuishi na kufanya kazi nchini, baada ya kile cha awali kuisha muda wake.	head coach of Stand United of Shinyanga, Patrick Liewig, has accused the leadership of the team of not cooperating to help him get a visa for living and working in the country, after the previous one expired.
<5>	Mfaransa huyo alisema tangu kujitoa kwa waliokuwa wadhamini wa timu hiyo Kampuni ya Uchimbaji Madini ya ACACIA, mambo yamekuwa yakifanywa bila mpangilio kwenye timu hiyo kiasi hata wachezaji na benchi la ufundi kushindwa kulipwa mishahara na posho zao.	the French man said that after the Acacia Mining Company withdrew their sponsorship of the team, things have been done without any organization in the team, to the extent of failing to pay players and the technical bench their salaries and allowances.
<6>	Akizungumza na gazeti hili, Liewig, ambaye kwa sasa yupo Dar es Salaam kwa ajili ya kukamilisha taratibu za kupata kibali kipya, alisema mambo yote hayo aliwaarifu viongozi wake akiwemo mwenyekiti wa Stand United, Ellyson Maeja ili amsaidie lakini hakufanikisha.	speaking with the newspaper, Liewig, who is now in Dar es Salaam for the purpose of completing the process of renewing his visa, said he had informed his leaders, including the chairperson of Stand United, Ellyson Maeja, about all these issues, to ask him to help, but he did not succeed.
<7>	“Nimeamua kujiweka pembeni na timu ili kushughulikia taratibu za kupata kibali cha kuishi hapa nchini, kile cha kwanza kimekwisha na uongozi wa Stand United haujaonesha jitihada za kunisaidia kupata, katika hili kuna mambo mengi yamekuwa yakienda ndivyo sivyo hasa baada ya kujiondoa kwa ACACIA,” alisema Liewig.	"I have decided to step aside from the team to attend to the process of acquiring a visa to live here in the country. the previous one has expired and the leadership of Stand United has not shown any effort to assist me in renewing it. in this case, there are many things that have been going wrong, especially after Acacia's withdrawal," Liewig said.
<8>	Mbali ya hayo ya kumalizika kwa kibali cha kufanyia kazi pia kocha huyo aliyeiwezesha timu hiyo kuanza vizuri msimu huu na kushika nafasi ya pili kwenye msimamo wa ligi wakiwa na pointi 16 nyuma ya vinara Simba kabla ya mechi yake ya jana dhidi ya Azam, alisema yapo mambo mengi maovu yanafanyika ndani ya timu ikiwemo hujuma.	apart from the work visa expiring, the coach who has helped the team make a good start this season, taking the second position in the league and standing 16 points behind the leaders, Simba, before their match yesterday against Azam, said there are many bad things happening in the team, including assault.
<9>	Kocha huyo alikwenda mbali zaidi baada ya kumtuhumu msaidizi wake Athuman Bilali ‘Billo’ akipanga kuhujumu timu na baadhi ya wachezaji.	the coach drifted further away after he accused his assistant Athuman Bilali 'Billo' of planning to sabotage the team and some of the players.
<10>	Alisema kocha huyo alikuwa aki washawishi wachezaji muhimu (anawataja) kufanya hujuma na lengo ni kufanya yeye (Liewig) aonekane si bora na hana uwezo.	the coach said that he has been persuading important players (he names them) to take up an offense, with the aim of making him (Liewig) appear inadequate and incompetent.
<11>	“Tatizo hilo la hujuma halipo kwa kocha msaidizi bali hata kwa Mwenyekiti Maeja, ambaye kabla ya mchezo wetu na Yanga alituahidi kuwalipa mishahara wachezaji, lakini zikiwa zimebaki siku mbili kiongozi huyo akaja na kuniambia fedha zile hazipo badala yake niongee na wachezaji ili kuwapa ari wacheze badala yake watawapa posho kwa kutumia fedha za matangazo ya Azam Tv,” alisema.	"this destructive plan is not only being hatched by the assistant coach, but also by Chairman Maeja, who before our game against Yanga, promised to pay the players their salaries, but with two days to go, the leader came and told me that the funds were not there. instead, I talked to players to give them motivation to play and told them they will give them their allowances instead, using cash from broadcasting on Azam television," he said.
<12>	Alisema hali kama hiyo ilijitokeza kwenye mchezo wao na Majimaji waliocheza ugenini na kushinda mabao 2-0, lakini alijitahidi kusimama kidete na hatimaye kupata ushindi huo pia jambo hilo lilimtokea Mbeya kwenye mchezo dhidi ya Mbeya City kwa Maeja na msaidizi wake Bilali, kuwachanganya wachezaji kwenye mazoezi ya mwisho kabla ya mchezo lakini alijitahidi kuzungumza na wachezaji na kufanikiwa kupata sare.	he said that a similar situation emerged in their game with Majimaji, which they played away and won 2-0, but he struggled on and stood strong, and eventually they got the victory. the same scenario also happened in Mbeya in the match against Mbeya City, with Maeja and his assistant Bilali confusing players during the last training before the match, but he struggled through it and talked with the players and they managed to get a draw.
<13>	Baada ya kuona mambo yanazidi kuwa magumu, kocha huyo anasema alizungumza na Mwanasheria wake Franck Nicolleau awaambie waajiri wake wavunje mkataba maana hawezi kufanya kazi isiyoendana na weledi.	after seeing things becoming more difficult, the coach says he talked to his personal lawyer, Franck Nicolleau, to inform his employers to terminate the contract because he cannot do work that is unprofessional.
<14>	Gazeti hili lilimtafuta Mwenyekiti wa Stand United Maeja lakini simu yale iliita bila majibu.	this newspaper tried to reach the chairman of Stand United Maeja, but his phone rang without a response.
<15>	Kwa upande wa kocha msaidizi Bilali akizungumzia tuhuma hizo alisema hana taraifa nazo na kwamba anachofahamu ni kwamba bosi wake yupo Dar es Salaam kwa ajili ya kumuuguza mkewe na siyo kitu kingine.	when speaking about the accusations, assistant coach Bilali said he has no information about them and that what he knows is that his boss is in Dar es Salaam attending to his wife and nothing else.
<16>	Bilali alikana tuhuma za kuhujumu timu na kuongeza kuwa kocha huyo hatakiwi na uongozi wa timu ndiyo maana anatapa tapa kwa kuzusha maneno.	Bilali denied the allegations of sabotaging the team and added that the coach is not wanted by the leadership of the team, hence he's using words to create slander.
<17>	“Hakuna ukweli wowote kuhusu mimi kuwarubuni wachezaji ili waifungishe timu, huyo kocha uongozi haumtaki pamoja na wachezaji na baada ya kuligundua hilo ameanza kuongea mambo yasiyo ya kweli kwenye vyombo vya habari ili ionekana kama anaonewa,”alisema Bilali.	"there is no truth to me deceiving players so that they can score against the team. the leadership of the team, as well as the players, do not want the coach, and after discovering that, he began saying untrue things to the media in order to appear as though he is being oppressed," said Bilali.
