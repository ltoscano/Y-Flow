<1>	Ulevi kikwazo maendeleo ya soka Rombo	alcoholism an obstacle to soccer development in Rombo.
<2>	Ni siku ya kawaida ya kazi, napita karibu na Shule ya Msingi Mashati iliyo katika Halmashauri ya Wilaya ya Rombo, ni wakati wa mapumziko na watoto wako nje wakicheza, soka na michezo mingine ya jadi.	it is a normal working day, I pass near Mashati Primary School which is in the Rombo district municipal, it is break time and the children are outside playing soccer and other traditional games.
<3>	Haihitaji uwe mtaalamu wa ufundi kujua kuwa watoto wale wana vipaji, wanapenda soka na wanajituma.	you don't need to be a technical expert to know that those children have talents, they love soccer and they are motivated.
<4>	Ingawa wanacheza kwa kujifurahisha, unaweza kuona kuwa ni watoto ambao endapo wataendelezwa watakuja kuwa wachezaji wazuri wa kulipwa siku za usoni.	although they are playing for entertainment, you can see that they are children who, if developed, they could become very well-paid players in the future.
<5>	Jioni napita tena mahali hapo hapo, uwanja ni mtupu, hakuna dalili ya mechi wala mazoezi pamoja na uwanja kuwa na ukubwa wa kutosha na miundombinu ya muhimu kama magoli ya chuma.	I pass by again in the evening and there and then the field is empty, there is no sign of a match or practice even with the field being big enough to have important infrastructure like metal goal posts.
<6>	Hiki ndicho kinachoonekana kwa macho, zaidi ya hapo, ushiriki wa wilaya hii kwenye michezo ya kimkoa na kitaifa ni hafifu na hata hakuna wanamichezo wengi kutokea hapa.	this is what is seen by the eye, more than that, the participation of this district in provincial and national games is weak and there aren't that many players from here.
<7>	Matokeo haya si ya bahati mbaya, kwa mwenendo unaoonekana miongoni mwa vijana wa hapa ni vigumu kupata wanamichezo wa ushindani kwani wengi hulowea kwenye utamaduni wa pombe.	these results are not by bad luck, for the trend visible among youths here is that it is hard to get competent players because many descend into the tradition of alcohol.
<8>	Changamoto ya ulevi wilayani Rombo imeshajadiliwa kiuchumi na athari zake na suala hili limewahi kufika kwenye chombo cha kutunga sheria na Mbunge wa Rombo, Joseph Selasini alilitolea ufafanuzi Bungeni.	the challenge of alcohol in the Rombo district has been discussed economically along with its effects and this issue has even reached the law-making body and Rombo parliamentarian, Joseph Selasini, spoke in detail about it in parliament.
<9>	Gazeti hili, toleo la Mei 19, 2015 liligusia kwa kina namna ambavyo ulevi umetishia afya na ustawi wa jamii, makala haya yanaangazia namna ulevi ulivyoathiri, kama si kuua kabisa michezo wilayani hapa.	this paper, the issue of May 19th, 2015, looked in depth about the ways which alcoholism has threatened the health and welfare of society. this article focuses on how alcohol has affected if not completely killing sports in this district.
<10>	Katika eneo ambalo biashara ya vileo hupatikana karibu kila umbali wa mita 100, si ajabu kuona vijana ambao ndiyo nguvukazi ya muhimu kwenye michezo, wakiwa hawajihusishi kabisa na michezo.	in an areas where a liquor business is found nearly every 100 meters, it is not astonishing to see youths who are an important workforce for sports not getting involved with it at all.
<11>	Kwa ujumla masuala ya michezo hapa wilayani huchukuliwa kwa wepesi na wadau, wachezaji, mashabiki na wakati fulani hata mamlaka zinazohusika na ustawi wa michezo kwenye Serikali za Mitaa.	in general, sports matters are taken lightly here in the district by stakeholders such as players, supporters and sometimes even by authorities involved in the welfare of sports for local governments.
<12>	Katika jamii ambayo watoto wadogo wana ari ya kucheza soka kisha vijana hawachezi wala kujihusisha, bila shaka kuna walakini mahali.	in a society where little children have the desire to play soccer and where the youths do not play nor involve themselves, there's no doubt there is a but somewhere.
<13>	Miongoni mwa jamii nyingi za Tanzania, soka ni mchezo wa ridhaa kwa ajili ya kuweka afya sawa na kuchangamana na watu wa rika, lakini hapa Rombo mambo ni tofauti kabisa.	among many communities in Tanzania, soccer is a consensual sport for the purpose of staying in good health and interacting with peers, but here in Rombo things are completely different.
<14>	Licha ya shule karibu zote za msingi na sekondari kuwa na viwanja vya soka na maeneo ya wazi, hakuna mwenye hamasa ya kushiriki michezo isipokuwa watoto wadogo ambao tofauti na watu wazima, hawawezi kukaa vilabuni kupoteza muda.	despite almost all primary and secondary school having soccer fields and open spaces, there is no one with the desire to participate in sports except young children who, compared to adults, cannot stay in clubs to waste time.
<15>	Zamani kidogo, vijana wa shule walitoka wilaya hii kwenda kushiriki mashindano mbalimbali ngazi ya mkoa na wilaya na waliwakilisha vyema, jambo ambalo sidhani kama linatokea miaka hii.	a little while ago, youths from school came from this district to go participate in various competitions at provincial and district levels and they represented us well. something that I don't think has happened in recent years.
<16>	Tarafa ya Mashati kwa mfano, nilimozaliwa na ambako asilimia kubwa ya wakazi ni wenyeji, hakuna pilikapilika za mashindano ya soka ya ridhaa kama ilivyokuwa kipindi cha nyuma.	in the Mashati division, for example, where I was born and where a big percentage of the residents are locals, there are no activities for soccer and athletics competitions as there were in the past.
<17>	Sehemu zenye uchangamani wa watu kama Holili na Tarakea walau zipo timu za soka na klabu za michezo mingine kama riadha.	in areas with a mixture of people like Holili and Tarakea, there are at least soccer teams and other sports clubs like athletics.
<18>	Haya ni matokeo ya utamaduni wa pombe, uliokita mizizi tangu zamani kwenye wilaya hii inayokadiriwa kuwa na zaidi ya aina 50 za pombe za jadi, hii ni kuacha mbali vileo vingine vya viwandani.	these are the results of the tradition of alcohol which was grounded in the past in this district that is estimated to have more than 50 types of traditional alcohol, this is apart from the other liquors in the factories.
<19>	Uwepo wa miundombinu ya michezo isiyotumika ni ushahidi kuwa watu wamekata tamaa na michezo, na nguvu zimeelekezwa kwenye ulevi.	the presence of sports infrastructure not in use is proof that people have given up on sports, and the energies have been directed to alcoholism.
<20>	Wapo wachezaji wa kulipwa huko Ulaya ambao maisha yao ya soka yaliathiriwa na ulevi, mfano Paul Gascoine `Gazza'wa England na Niklas Bendtner wa Denmark.	there are paid players in Europe whose soccer lives were affected by alcoholism, for example, Paul Gascoine 'Gazza' of England and Niklas Bendtner of Denmark.
<21>	Haitoshi kusema tu, viongozi wa michezo na Serikali Rombo na Kilimanjaro wachukue hatua.	it is not enough to just talk, the sports and government leaders of Rombo and Kilimanjaro should take measures.
