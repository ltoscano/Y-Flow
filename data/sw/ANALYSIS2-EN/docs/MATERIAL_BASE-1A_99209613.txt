<1>	Sakata la Mkude hali tete	Mkude scandal a complex situation
<2>	December 7, 2016	7th December 2016
<3>	WAKATI sakata la Jonas Mkude likiendelea kuwakuna vichwa viongozi wa Simba, bado hali ni tete kwani pamoja na uongozi kutaka kusajili mchezaji mpya, bado mapingamizi yapo ya kila aina.	as Jonas Mkude's scandal continues to cause Simba leaders to scratch their heads, the situation is still tricky. together with leaders wanting to sign a new player, there are still all kinds of contradictions.
<4>	Simba kwa sasa imepasuka vipande viwili ambapo baadhi ya viongozi wanataka mchezaji huyo aachwe aamua analotaka, huku wengine wakitaka arejeshwe kikosini.	Simba is now split into two parts, where some of the leaders want the player to be left to decide whatever he wants while, others want him to be returned to the squad.
<5>	Hii inatoka na mchezaji huyo kutaka dau kubwa na kibaya zaidi, kuamua kuwazimia simu viongozi wake pale walipokuwa wanamsaka.	this results from the player wanting a large pay and worst of all deciding to switch off his phone when the management was looking for him.
<6>	Inadaiwa Simba wapo tayari kutoa kiasi cha Sh milioni 60 ili kumbakisa, lakini Mkude ameona dau hilo dogo na anatakakuongezewa.	it is claimed that Simba are ready to offer 60 million shillings to retain him, but Mkude sees that as too little and wants an increase.
<7>	Tayari Mkude amekiri kuwazimia simu viongozi wa klabu hiyo, lakini kisa cha yote ni kile alichodai kukerwa na wao kutoa habari ambazo si sahihi.	Mkude has confessed to switching off his phone on the managers of that club, but the main incident is when he claimed he was annoyed with them for releasing a false statement.
<8>	Mkude alikiri, alizima simu kwani alilazimika kufanya hivyo kutokana na usumbufu mkubwa aliokuwa akiupata kutoka kwa watu mbalimbali.	Mkude confessed he switched off his phone because he was forced to do so from the great disturbance he was receiving from various people.
<9>	Hii ni baada ya viongozi wa Simba, kutoa taarifa ya kuthibitisha wamemsajili Mkude na kumalizana naye kila kitu, wakati haikuwa hivyo.	this is after Simba managers released a statement, confirming that they have signed Mkude and finished everything with him when it wasn't the case.
<10>	'Kweli nilizima simu, hii ni baada ya wao kudai nimesaini mkataba mpya wakati si kweli, huku wengine wakiniomba fedha,' alisema.	"it is true I switched off my phone. this is after they claimed I had signed a new contract when it was not true, while others were asking me for money,' he said.
<11>	Lakini chanzo chetu kimepasha, uongozi upo ndani ya vipande viwili na hawajui cha kufanya kwa sasa.	but our source confirms, the management is in two pieces and they currently don't know what to do.
