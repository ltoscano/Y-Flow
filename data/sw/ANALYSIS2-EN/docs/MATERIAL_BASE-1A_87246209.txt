<4>	LIGI ya wanawake imeanza kwa mara ya kwanza mwaka huu, ilipozinduliwa Novemba mosi.	the women's leagues has started for the first time this year when it was launched on the first of November.
<5>	Pia, ligi ya vijana wenye umri chini ya miaka 20 kwa timu za Ligi Kuu Tanzania bara ilianza wiki mbili zilizopita.	additionally, the league for young adults under 20 within the premier leagues in mainland Tanzania started two weeks ago.
<6>	Kwa hili napongeza kwa sababu ni hatua mojawapo ya kusogeza mbele michezo kwa kuendelea kutengeneza sura za vijana wenye vipaji.	I applaud this because it is a step towards advancing sports by continuing to mold the faces of talented youths.
<7>	Ligi hii ya vijana sio mara ya kwanza kufanyika, kilichobadilika ni muda wa mashindano na mazingira, kwani sasa ni muda mrefu.	it is not the first time for a youth league to take place, what changed is the competition period and the conditions because it has been a long time now.
<8>	Matarajio ya mashabiki wa soka ni kuona ligi hizo zinaendelea kuibua vipaji na kuendelezwa ikiwezekana kutengeneza timu za taifa kuanzia umri mdogo.	the soccer fans' expectations are to see those leagues continuing to raise talents and promote them, and, if possible, the formation of national teams from a tender age.
<9>	Nikianza kwa kuangalia upande wa wanawake, kwa vile ni mara ya kwanza, ni matarajio ya wengi kuona timu ya taifa ijayo inabadilika na kuwa na wachezaji wengi wenye uwezo.	when I started looking at the women's side, because it is the first time, the expectation from many people is to see changes in the next national team with many capable players.
<10>	Ilizoeleka wachezaji wanaoitwa mara kwa mara sura ni zile zile.	it was common that the players called from time to time were the same faces.
<11>	Kuna wakati wachezaji hao watachoka na kuhitaji kupumzika.	there is a time when those players will be tired and will need to rest.
<12>	Kupitia ligi hiyo ni muhimu kuangalia vijana wengine ambao wataandaliwa kuanzia sasa kwa ajili ya wakati ujao.	through this league, it is important to look for other youths who will be prepared now for the purpose of the future.
<13>	Wapo wasichana wengi ambao wanapenda kucheza soka, na wengine pengine ni mara yao ya kwanza kuonekana kwenye ligi hiyo, basi ni wakati wao kupewa nafasi kwa kuboresha zaidi.	there are many girls who like to play soccer, and it maybe the first time for some to appear in this league so then it their time to be given a chance to become better.
<14>	Kwa upande wa vijana kuna tatizo.	there is a problem on the side of the youths.
<15>	Tunaambiwa kuwa ni vijana wenye umri chini ya miaka 20 lakini jambo la kusikitisha kuna vijeba.	we are told that it is for young people under 20 years of age but the shocking thing is that there are dwarfs.
<16>	Najiuliza ligi hii ni ya vijeba au watoto?	I ask, is the league for dwarfs or children?
<17>	Kama hatutilii mkazo suala la umri tutapata wapi vipaji vya kweli? Wapo vijana wengi wanaocheza soka nzuri, ndio ambao wanahitaji kupewa nafasi ya kuonekana ili wapatikane wachezaji wazuri kwa ajili ya timu za taifa za vijana.	if we don't insist on age, where will we get genuine talent from? there are many youths who play soccer well who need to be given the chance to be seen so as to get good players for the sake of the youth national team.
<18>	Kwa hili, Shirikisho la Soka Tanzania (TFF) litilie mkazo kwa kuchunguza timu ambazo zinachezesha vijeba ikiwezekana zichukuliwe hatua.	the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) should insist on this by scrutinizing teams that include dwarfs and they should be held responsible.
<19>	Au kama sivyo, kunahitajika tafsiri ya kweli maana ya timu za vijana umri halisi unaotakiwa ni upi.	or else, there is a need for true interpretation of what the real age youth teams are supposed to be.
<20>	Manake haiwezekani wasema chini ya umri wa miaka 20 na mwisho wa siku wanaoonekana sio wenyewe.	because it isn't possible for them to say under 20 years of age and those seen at the end of the day are not.
<21>	Japo sio timu zote ambazo zimekuwa zikichezesha vijeba, kuna nyingine zimedhamiria kweli hata ukiangalia wachezaji wake wana umri huo unaotakiwa lakini pia, baadhi yao huangusha.	although it's not all teams that include dwarfs, there are some that have on purpose and even their players are visibly of the required age but some of them are a let down.
<22>	Timu ziwe makini kwani wanachofanya hakijengi zaidi ya kubomoa, zioneshe dhamira ya kweli kama zinataka kuleta mapinduzi ya kimchezo badala ya kuangalia vijeba wa muda mrefu kwa ajili ya kubeba kombe na pesa taslim.	teams should be keen because their actions are not building more than tearing down, they should show true intentions if they want to bring radical change in sports instead of considering permanent dwarfs for the sake of capturing the cup and cash money.
<23>	Jambo lingine ni wachezaji.	the players are another thing.
<24>	Baadhi yao sio wakweli wanaona fahari kudaganya umri.	some of them aren't truthful and find it prestigious to lie about age.
<25>	Eti mtu anasema ana umri wa miaka 18 kumbe ana miaka 25, kwa kweli haipendezi hata kidogo.	it is not pleasant for someone to say that he is 18 years of age when he is 25 years old.
<26>	Kudanganya umri wakati sura inaonyesha wazi kuwa sio, ni kujidaganya mwenyewe na kuwanyima nafasi wale wanaotakiwa ndani ya kikosi.	lying about age when the appearance clearly shows someone is lying and denying a chance to those who are supposed to be inside the unit.
<27>	Pamoja na hilo, kupitia ligi hiyo vijana ni fursa kubwa kwao kujiuza.	together with that, it is a big chance for the youth to market themselves through that league.
<28>	Kwa maana kwamba timu kubwa zinazosajili ni wakati wao kuwapa nafasi wale wanaoonyesha uwezo na kuwasaidia kukuza vipaji vyao.	meaning that for the big teams conducting registration, it is time to give those who show ability a chance to help them grow their talents.
<29>	Timu nyingi zimekuwa na tabia mbaya ya kutozalisha wachezaji wenye vipaji.	many teams have had bad manners in not producing talented players.
<30>	Na hata kama wanazalisha hawawatumii ipasavyo, mwisho wa siku baadhi hukata tamaa na kuacha soka na wengine kuhama kutoka timu moja kwenda nyingine.	and even if they are producing them, they do not use them as required and at the end of the day some of them give up and abandon soccer while others move from one team to another.
<31>	Baadhi ya timu kama Azam FC na Mtibwa zimekuwa na utaratibu mzuri wa kuibua vijana vyao, ingawa huvuma kwa muda mchache.	some of the teams like Azam FC and Mtibwa have had good procedures of raising their youths even though they became famous for a short time.
<32>	Wengi huamini nje ndiko kwenye vijana wenye vipaji hivyo, husajili kwa gharama kubwa na kuwaacha wale walioko nyumbani ambao wakisaidiwa wanafanana na hao wa kutoka nje.	many believe the talented youths are outside and therefore expensively sign up and leave the ones at home who can be like the foreign ones when helped.
<33>	Hao wachezaji wa nje, ni wazuri kwa sababu wanakuzwa kwenye vituo vya kukuza soka.	the foreign players are good because they are developed at soccer development centers.
<34>	Vile vile, hapa nchini vipo isipokuwa dhana imejengeka kwa vile ni taifa fulani lililoendelea kimichezo basi wachezaji hao watakuwa wazuri.	likewise, they are there in the country although there's a built notion that those players will be good because they are from a certain developed nation sports-wise.
<35>	Kumbe hata wao wangeshiriki kukuza vipaji vya vijana wao wangekuwa na uwezo wa kuwauza sehemu mbalimbali.	instead if they participated in growing their youth's talent then they would have the ability to sell them in various places.
<36>	Tubadilike wakati ndio huu wa kufanya mabadiliko ya kweli.	let's change, the time is here to make genuine changes.
<37>	Waibuliwe kupitia ligi hizo na waendelezwe kwa manufaa ya taifa hili.	they should be raised through those leagues and promoted for the benefit of this nation.
