<1>	(0.000-2.953)	<sta> baada ya kutazama kichekesho sasa Mada inaendelea .	after watching the comedy now the topic of debate continues .
<2>	(2.953-6.289)	kwa mfano mimi ukinikosea kama ni barabarani tunamalizana barabarani .	for example if you wrong me whether it's on the road we sort it out on the road .
<3>	(6.289-6.983)	unachana live .	you tear it up live .
<4>	(6.983-8.370)	mimi nakuchana live .	I tear you up live .
<5>	(8.370-11.497)	<sta> siwezi kusubiri kwamba umenikosea barabarani nikuchane nyumbani .	I can't wait since you have wronged me on the road for me to tear you up at home .
<6>	(11.497-11.868)	ahh ahh .	ahh ahh .
<7>	(11.868-17.123)	umenich- -- yaani tumekosana hapa hapa ni hapo hata kama ni kwenye daladala watu wamekaa kimya <sta> tunamalizana hapo kwenye daladala .	you have -- I mean we disagreed right here it's there even if it's on the bus people are seated silently we sort each other there in the bus .
<8>	(17.123-18.077)	lengo ni nini ?	what is the goal ?
<9>	(18.077-21.310)	lengo ni jirekebishe na Watanzania wanasema ujiongeze .	the aim is that you reform and Tanzanians are saying develop yourself .
<10>	(21.310-24.360)	<sta> cha msingi ni kwamba ujiongeze hata issue ya (()) haiwezi kuwa hivyo .	of essence is that you develop yourself even the issue of (()) it can't be like that .
<11>	(24.360-27.495)	<sta> kwamba wametajwa hawa watu sijui Namugongo -- sijui kina muhogo .	that they have mentioned these people I don't know Namugongo -- I don't know the likes of Muhogo .
<12>	(27.495-30.560)	<sta> wametajwa kwamba watu wamefanya nini ?	they have mentioned that what have people done ?
<13>	(30.560-33.785)	<sta> wame- -- wameaibishwa lengo lake ni kwamba wajirekebishe .	they have -- have been shamed his goal is that they reform .
<14>	(33.785-36.376)	mimi naweza kuwa pengine nami mi nimepewa mgao .	maybe I might also have been given a share .
<15>	(36.376-40.324)	sasa ule mgao nimeletewa <sta> sijakwenda kuomba kule lakini nimeletewa .	now that share has been brought to me I haven't gone there to request but it has been brought to me .
<16>	(40.324-41.306)	je mimi ni mwizi ?	am I a thief ?
<17>	(41.306-43.830)	wa kwako kwa nini usipeleke wa kwako .	yours why don't you take yours .
<18>	(43.830-46.030)	wananifahamu mzee unanifahamu .	they know me old man you know me .
<19>	(46.030-50.690)	<sta> mzee tumekuletea hizo hapo zitakusaidia . <no-speech> <sta> sasa mimi nindi- -- ni mwizi nini ?	old man we have brought you those here they will help you now I -- am a thief what ?
<20>	(50.690-52.969)	<overlap> mwizi shirikishi .	partner in crime .
<21>	(52.969-54.979)	kwa nini yule aliyegawa yule asikamatwe ?	why wasn't the one who distributed that one not arrested ?
<22>	(54.979-55.447)	ni mwizi shirikishi .	is a partner in crime .
<23>	(55.447-58.030)	kwa sababu yule hajafuatwa na issue yoyote .	because that one has not been followed by any issue .
<24>	(58.030-58.470)	<sta> eh ?	yes ?
<25>	(58.470-59.165)	yule aliyegawa .	the one who distributed .
<26>	(59.165-61.750)	lakini wale waliogawiwa wale eh .	but those who got the share those yes .
<27>	(61.750-63.203)	wameonekana ni wezi .	they seem to be thieves .
<28>	(63.203-64.460)	yule aliyegawa vipi ?	how did that one divide ?
<29>	(64.460-66.060)	<sta> kumtaja mtu sio kumwaibisha .	mentioning someone is not shaming him .
<30>	(66.060-72.781)	nafikiri kumwaibisha <breath> ni mtu pale utakapopelekwa kwenye vyombo vya sheria <breath> apatikane na hatia afungwe ndiyo hapo ameshaaibishwa <sta> tayari .	I think to shame someone is a person when you're taken to the law agencies and be found with an guilty of an offense and jailed that's when he has already been shamed .
<31>	(72.781-79.190)	wengine wanasema kuaibisha ni njia ya kuweza kuweza kumrekebisha mtu wengine wanasema kwamba haifai kurekebisha mtu .	others say to shame is a way of being able being able to reform a person others say that it's not right to reform someone .
<32>	(79.190-83.950)	<sta> sasa tunaona mfumo huu uendelee ama usitishwe katika jamii zetu ?	now do we think this system should continue or it be stopped in our communities ?
<33>	(83.950-84.357)	<sta> mama ?	mother ?
<34>	(84.357-91.540)	huo mfumo uendelee kwa sababu wengine <sta> hawawezi kuwacha tabia mpaka wa- -- waaibishwe .	that system should continue because others can't stop the behavior unless they -- are shamed .
<35>	(91.540-95.183)	<sta> na kuna mwingine anaweza akajirekebisha tu kwa kuambiwa fanya hivi -- fanya hivi .	and there is one who can reform himself just by being told do this way -- do this .
<36>	(95.183-96.854)	lakini wengine mpaka waaibishwe .	but others unless they are shamed .
<37>	(96.854-99.040)	kwa hiyo kuaibishwa kunaweza kubadilisha .	therefore being ashamed can be able to bring change .
<38>	(99.040-101.087)	<sta> kwa wale ambao hawa- -- hawataki kujirekebisha .	for those of who cannot -- do not want to reform themselves .
<39>	(101.087-107.082)	ili ujirekebishe inabidi mfumo huo huo uendelee kuaibisha . ukifanya kosa unaaibishwa .	in order to reform yourself it requires that that system continues to shame if you commit a mistake you're shamed .
<40>	(107.082-108.209)	ukimkanyanga mtu unatukanwa .	if you step on someone you're insulted .
<41>	(108.209-108.964)	kama kawaida .	as usual .
<42>	(108.964-110.111)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<43>	(110.111-111.659)	kama kawai- <sta> -- kawaida .	as -- usual .
<44>	(111.659-113.388)	wewe huoni watu wanakuwa sugu sasa .	don't you see people are now becoming insensitive .
<45>	(113.388-115.840)	<overlap> sio sugu ngoja nikuambie dada yangu sio sugu .	not insensitive wait let me tell you my sister it isn't insensitivity .
<46>	(115.840-117.996)	<sta> cha msingi tunachotaka sisi watu wafanyaje ?	of essence is what do we want people to do ?
<47>	(117.996-118.909)	wajirekebishe .	to reform themselves .
<48>	(118.909-123.212)	<overlap> ukisema kwamba wewe ukinifanyia kosa <sta> tunakuwacha tu .	if you say that you if you do wrong we should just leave you .
<49>	(123.212-125.819)	tuangalie tu tukutizame tu tusikuaibishe tukuangalie tu .	we just look at you we just observe you we don't shame you we just look at you .
<50>	(125.819-128.563)	si unamtonya kipole pole kwamba hapa <sta> kusiwe hapo .	you should warn him gently that it shouldn't be so there .
<51>	(128.563-130.879)	ahh ni kutonya kwa sababu ni kutonya haisaidii .	ahh it's lack of warning because lack of warning doesn't help .
<52>	(130.879-133.854)	kama ingekuwa inasaidia <sta> hivi vitu vingekuwa havipo .	if it was helping these things would not be there .
<53>	(133.854-134.699)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<54>	(134.699-146.763)	kwa sababu <sta> watu wameanza wa -- wameanza ku- -- nani kudhalilishwa au kuaibishwa hadharani muda -- muda mrefu sana lakini kila siku matukio yanatokea <sta> na bado anazidi kuendelea sasa inasaidia nini ?	because people have started have -- have started to -- to be oppressed or to be ashamed openly for a very long time but everyday incidents happen and he still continues now what does it help ?
<55>	(146.763-147.679)	mimi naona haisaidii .	I don't see it helping .
<56>	(147.679-154.520)	mtu kama unataka <sta> hivi vitendo vi- -- yaani vikomeshwe naona tu kuwaelimisha tu .	if someone wants these acts to -- I mean to be stopped I just think it's just to educate them .
<57>	(154.520-158.368)	<sta> ni kitu kigumu -- yaani kumuelimisha mtu ni kitu kizuri zaidi kuliko kumuaibisha .	it's a hard thing -- I mean to educate someone is something better than shaming him .
<58>	(158.368-167.281)	watu wanazungumza lakini wanatenganisha wanasema kuna ingine ya kuweka hadharani <sta> kumuaibisha mtu hadharani na kuna ingine ambayo unamwita unamtonya unamwambia kimya kimya .	people talk but they separate they say there are some to be openly put to shame someone publicly and there are some whereby you call him and disparage him by quietly telling him .
<59>	(167.281-168.349)	kweli -- kweli kabisa .	true -- very true .
<60>	(168.349-173.688)	kwa mfano kama mtu labda jana ni leo amepata amebakisha nguvu ya kumutemea mate <sta> yeye si kusema kwa watu .	for example if a person maybe yesterday it's today he has got the strength left to spit on him he does not speak amidst people .
<61>	(173.688-177.576)	lakini wakasema mambo ingine ile ya kiserikali unaweka hadharani .	but they said other government issues you put it publicly .
<62>	(177.576-181.547)	mambo ya ndoa -- mambo ya ndoa unaya- <sta> -- ndani -- unayaweka ndani .	marital issues -- marital issues you -- inside -- you keep them secret .
<63>	(181.547-183.035)	wamesema hivi .	they have said this .
<64>	(183.035-186.710)	<overlap> sasa wale ambao wanataka kutembelea hii %incomplete	now those who want to visit this %incomplete
