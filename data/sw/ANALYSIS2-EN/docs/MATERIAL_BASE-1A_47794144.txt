<4>	MBUNGE wa Viti Maalumu Mkoa wa Tabora, Munde Tambwe amewezesha wajasiriamali 8,700 kutoka kata 29 za jimbo la Tabora Mjini kwa gharama ya Sh milioni 23.	the parliamentarian of special seats in Tabora Province, Munde Tambwe, has empowered 8,700 entrepreneurs from 29 counties of Tabora Province at a cost of 23 million shillings.
<5>	Akizungumza na wajasiriamali hao katika kata ya Isevya ikiwa ni mwendelezo wa semina ya mafunzo kwa wajasiriamali wadogo, mbunge huyo alisema amedhamiria kuwakomboa wajasiliamali wadogo.	speaking with the entrepreneurs in Isevya County in a continuation of the seminar on training small entrepreneurs, the parliamentarian said he intends to rescue small entrepreneurs.
<6>	Alisema amefikia hatua hiyo ili kuunga mkono juhudi za serikali ya Rais John Magufuli za kusaidia na kuinua wanyonge nchini.	he said he came to this decision to support the efforts by President John Magufuli's government to help the country's poor people.
<7>	Tambwe alisema kutokana na semina ya mafunzo aliyotoa kwenye kata zote 29 za manispaa Tabora, sasa nguvu zote amehamishia katika kutoa mitaji kwa wajasiriamali waliopata mafunzo hayo.	Tambwe said as a result of the training seminar that he gave in all the 29 counties of Tabora Province, he has now transferred all the power by giving capital to the entrepreneurs who got the training.
<8>	Alisema katika kata zote 29 mwezi huu, ametoa Sh milioni 14.5	he said between all the 29 counties this month, he has given out 14.5 million shillings.
<9>	na kila kata itapata mgawo wa mtaji wa Sh 500,000 ili waliopatiwa mafunzo wakaanze kuyatumia kwa kuzalisha.	and every county will get a capital allocation of 500,000 shillings so that those who received the training could start using the money in production.
<10>	Alisema licha ya kutoa mitaji hiyo, bado yeye kama mbunge wa Viti Maalumu, atazunguka mkoa mzima kuendesha mafunzo hayo kwa akinamama, ambao kimsingi ndiyo wazalishaji wakubwa.	he said despite giving the capital, he as a parliamentarian of the special seats will still go around the whole province to conduct the training to women, who basically are the biggest producers.
<11>	Aliwaomba wajasiriamali hao mitaji atakayotoa, itumike kwenye malengo waliyojiwekea kwani tangu 2010 alianza na mradi huo, ambapo vipo vikundi vimetumia mitaji yao vyema na vingine vimekufa kwa sababu ya kutofuata mafunzo.	he requested that the entrepreneurs use the capital that he will provide towards goals they set, because since he started the project in 2010, there were groups which used their capital well and some which died because they didn't follow the training.
<12>	Alisema mafunzo waliyopata wajasiriamali hao ni utengenezaji sabuni za maji na ngumu, utengenezaji mishumaa, utengezaji batiki, utengenezaji shampoo, utengenezaji mafuta ya kula na usindikaji mazao.	he said that the training the entrepreneurs received was in making liquid and solid soaps, candles, batiks, shampoos, cooking fat and processing produce.
<13>	Alisema mafunzo mengine waliyopata ni utunzaji vitabu vya kumbukumbu za fedha, ukopaji fedha kwenye taasisi za kifedha na jinsi ya kuweka na kukopa.	he said that the other training they received was on authoring books on financial records, borrowing money from financial institutions and how to save and borrow.
<14>	Alisisitiza kuwa amepanga kuzunguka katika wilaya zote, kuendesha mafunzo hayo.	he insisted that he had planned to go around all districts to conduct the training.
<15>	Rukia Mwango kutoka kata ya Ikomwa alisema mafunzo waliyopata yatawasaidia kujikomboa na hali ya umasikini na sasa kuwa wazalishaji.	Rukia Mwango from Ikoma County said the training she received will help them to save themselves from conditions of poverty and now become producers.
<16>	Zinduna Abdalah, Diwani wa Viti Maalumu, alisema wao kwenye kikundi chao walianza na mtaji wa Sh 300,000 lakini sasa wana Sh milioni saba.	Zinduna Abdala, the councilor of the special seats, said they started with a capital of 300,000 shillings in their group, but they now have seven million shillings.
