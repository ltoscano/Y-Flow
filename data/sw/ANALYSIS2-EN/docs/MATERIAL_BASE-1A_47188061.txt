<4>	MFANYABIASHARA unapaswa uelewe kuwa, machozi ya wateja wako yanayotokana na hasara unayowaletea, kwa kutumia huduma yako au kwa kununua bidhaa yako isiyofaa ni mkosi na huyastahili.	as businesspeople, you are supposed to understand that complaints by your customers, which result from losses you cause them when they use your services or buy your unsuitable products, are annoying and you do not deserve them. 
<5>	Inaelezwa kuwa, kufanya kazi kwa jambo linalotajwa kuwa sababu mbaya ya mfanyabiashara au hata mtu wa kawaida kutofanikiwa kunategemea na imani ya mtu mwenyewe, lakini, kutokana na ukweli kuwa machozi ya uchungu wa kupoteza kitu au fedha kwa uzembe wa mwingine, huambatana na malalamiko yenye kujutia.	explained that, working on a thing that is said to be the bad cause of a businessperson or even normal person to be unsuccessful depends on the person's own belief, but as a result of the truth that tears of pain of losing something or money from laziness of another are linked to the complaints with regret.
<6>	Mtandao wa www.answers.com unasema, ikishafikia hatua mteja anajuta na kusema sitarejea tena dukani pale, kwa mfanyabiashara inakuwa ni mwisho mbaya, unaoweza kutafsiriwa kuwa ni mkosi.	the website www.answers.com says that when it reaches a stage where a customer is regretting your business and saying "I will not go back to that shop again", this turns out badly for the businessperson, and can turn into misfortune.
<7>	Mtandao huo unaeleza kuwa maneno hayo ya mteja yanakuwa ni kama mkosi au neno la kutakia biashara husika mwisho mbaya.	the website explains that these customers' words are like a curse or words wishing the business concerned bad luck.
<8>	Ni msemo unaolaani, kubomoa, badala ya kujenga.	their words become a curse that damages your business instead of enhancing it.
<9>	“Mteja anapaswa ashawishiwe kwa ubora wa huduma na bidhaa ili arudi tena kuifuata.	"a customer should be convinced by the best quality of services and products so that he comes back for it.
<10>	Akiudhiwa na kusababishwa anyanyue mikono juu kuonesha kutotaka tena kwenda kufuata huduma au bidhaa mahali alipohudumiwa vibaya,inakuwa ni jambo linaloondoa neema kwenye biashara husika,” www.answers.com, inasema.	if he is annoyed and caused to surrender, demonstrating an unwillingness to ever again seek the services or goods of the business where he was badly serviced, it becomes a matter that removes good will from the business concerned," www.answers.com says.
<11>	Cha msingi, inaelezwa kuwa, wafanyabiashara hawanabudi kukwepa kusababisha mazingira ya wateja kujuta kuzifahamu biashara zao na kuzinunua.	basically, it's explained that businesspeople have no choice but to avoid situations where customers regret knowing of and buying from their businesses.
<12>	“Katika huduma ndio kabisa, wafanyabiashara wanapaswa kuhakikisha wateja wanapo zitumia wanatoka kwenye eneo la biashara wakitabasamu na kuahidi kurudi wakati mwingine wakiwa wameongozana na wenzao wapya,” www.answers.com inasema.	"in the service sector, businesspeople should ensure that when customers use their services, they leave the business location smiling and promise to come back another time, along with new referrals," www.answers.com says.
<13>	Katika safu hii, Jumatano ya wiki iliyopita nilizungumzia uaminifu katika biashara ya bidhaa na huduma, ambapo, nilieleza kisa cha wahudumu wa hoteli moja mkoani Mbeya walivyoonesha kukosa uaminifu, hivyo kuhatarisha biashara yao.	in this column, on Wednesday last week I talked about honesty in the business of goods and services and I explained the story of the waiters of one hotel in Mbeya province, and how they showed a lack of honesty, thereby endangering their business.
<14>	Baada ya kuandika nilichokiandika, nilipigiwa simu na kupata ujumbe wa maandishi kupitia barua pepe, inayosomeka chini ya safu hii, nikielezwa aina nyingine ya kukosa uaminifu, ambayo, wahudumu katika hoteli za kati na nyumba za kulala wageni mijini, wanaitumia ‘kuliza’ wateja.	after writing this, I was called on the phone and got a written message via the email address that is written below this column, which explained a different form of dishonesty that waiters in the mid-range hotels and guesthouses in town use 'to ask' customers.
<15>	Wasomaji wa safu hii, akiwemo Bonaventure Gasper wa Mbeya, Kamugisha (alitaja jina moja) kutoka Kigoma na Asnath Kileo wa Morogoro, wameeleza walivyo poteza mali katika nyumba hizo, walipofikia kupata malazi.	readers of this column, including Bonaventure Gasper of Mbeya, Kamugisha (he gave one name) from Kigoma and Asnath Kileo of Morogoro, have explained how they lost money in these houses when they arrived to seek accommodation.
<16>	Kila mmoja alikuwa safarini kivyake.	each man was traveling by himself.
<17>	Walituma ujumbe kwa siku na muda toauti kueleza yaliyowakuta.	they sent the message on different days and times to explain what happened to them.
<18>	Ni watu wasio na uhusiano, ukaribu na hawafahamiani.	these are people without relationship or familiarity to each other and they do not know each other.
<19>	Wawili kati yao visa vyao vinafanana na mwingine kisa chake kina tofauti.	two of their stories are similar and the other one has a difference.
<20>	Nikianza na Gasper, yeye anasema wakati akihamia Mbeya kikazi, alilazimika kukaa katika nyumba ya kulala wageni kwa wiki moja huku akifanya maandalizi ya kuhamia kwenye nyumba aliyopangiwa na ofisi yake, kwani ilipaswa kufanyiwa ukarabati.	starting with Gasper: he says that when he moved to Mbeya for work, he was forced to live in the guesthouse for one week while making preparations to move into the house allocated to him by his office, since it had to be renovated.
<21>	Anasema, kwa maana hiyo, alikuwa akiishi kwenye nyumba hiyo ya wageni ambapo, asubuhi alilazimika kwenda ofisini na kurejea jioni kulala.	he says for that reason, he used to live in that guesthouse, and in the morning he was forced to go to the office and go back to the guesthouse in the evening to sleep.
<22>	Kwa maelezo yake, wakati akienda kazini alikuwa akiacha vifaa vyake, zikiwemo nguo na viatu katika chumba alichokilipia kwa wiki nzima.	according to his description, when he went to work he used to leave his belongings, including cloths and shoes, in the room that he had paid for for the whole week.
<23>	Gasper anaeleza kuwa, kama kawaida, saa tatu hadi saa nne, mhudumu huingia chumbani hapo kufanya usafi, jambo ambalo hakuwahi kulipinga kwa sababu ni utaratibu wa nyumba za wageni na ni haki ya mteja kubadilishiwa shuka na vifaa vingine vinavyostahili kubadilishwa.	Gasper explains that normally between nine and ten o'clock the waiter would enter the room to clean, a matter he never opposed, because it is a standard procedure for guesthouses, and it is the right of the customer to have the sheets and other items changed as required.
<24>	Anasema kuwa, kumbe ilikuwa ni mchezo kwa baadhi ya wahudumu katika nyumba hiyo ya wageni kukikodisha upya chumba kile kwa wateja wa chap chap (wa haraka haraka) wanaofika kupata vyumba kwa ajili ya kutekeleza shughuli za kimapenzi zaidi.	he says that indeed it was a game for some of the waiters in that guesthouse to rent the room out to short-term customers (with haste) who arrive to rent the rooms in order to carry out more amorous activities.
<25>	“Kama miujiza ya Mungu, kwa kuwa ilizoeleka kwamba nikitoka saa 12 asubuhi narudi saa 2:30 au saa 3:00 usiku, siku moja nilirudi ghafla saa 7:23 kwa ajili ya kufuata karatasi yangu fulani, nikasumbuliwa sana kupewa ufunguo wa chumba na mhudumu niliyemkuta..,	"just like God's miracles, for it was normal for me to leave at 6 o'clock in the morning and return at 8:30 or 9:00 at night, but one day I returned suddenly at 1:23 pm to pick up a certain paper of mine, and I found that the hostess was really reluctant to give me the key to my room.
<26>	”Gasper anasema.	"says Gasper.
<27>	Anasimulia kuwa ilimchukua takriban dakika 45 kabla ya kushuhudia kwa macho yake mwanamke na mwanamume mmoja wakitoka chumbani hapo na kupacha wazi, huku mizigo yake ikiwa ndani bila uangalizi wowote, kuhakikisha kuwa ilikuwa salama.	he says that it took him approximately 45 minutes before witnessing with his own eyes a certain woman and a man coming out of his room and leaving it open while his luggage was inside, without any security to ensure it was safe.
<28>	Kwa maelezo yake, kazi siku hiyo ilivurugika kwa sababu alilazimika kuendelea kupoteza muda kukagua vitu vyake ambapo, aligundua kuwa marashi yake yaliibwa pamoja na kifurushi cha vitambaa vipya vya mkono (leso za rangi ya brown).	in his explanation, his work day was disrupted, because he was forced to continue wasting time checking his things, and he realized that his perfumes were stolen as well as a packet of new handkerchiefs (brown handkerchiefs).
<29>	Anasema bahati nzuri ni kwamba hakuwahi kuacha fedha ndani ya chumba kile na hakuwa na nguo nyingi wala kitu kingine cha thamani zaidi ya marashi ambayo hadi anahama mahali hapo, hakujua kuwa aliyeiba ni mhudumu au wale wateja wa chap chap.	he says that the good stroke of luck was that he never left money inside the room and he did not have many clothes or anything of more value than the perfume, and until he moved out of the place, he did not know whether the person who stole it was a waiter or one of those short-term customers.
<30>	Kamugisha anasema, uaminifu kwa baadhi ya wafanyabiashara wa hoteli na nyumba za kulala wageni ni sifuri kwa sababu wamekuwa wakitumia vyumba vilivyokwisha lipiwa kuhudumia watu wengine .	Kamugisha says that some of the businesspeople of hotels and guesthouses have zero honesty because they have been using rooms that have been paid for to serve other people.
<31>	Huyo anasema yeye fedha zake ziliibwa na wateja wa chap chap waliyopewa chumba chake, na aligundua hivyo muda mfupi baada ya kurejea na kukuta nguo zake zilivyokuwa zimepangwa katika begi sivyo zilivyokuwa wakati akirejea.	he says his money was stolen by short-term customers who were given his room and he realized that shortly after returning, he found that his clothes were not in the same way they had been arranged in the bag.
<32>	Anasema, “Uzuri ni kwamba, nilipolalamika kuwa fedha zangu zimeibwa mhudumu aliwaita wahusika aliowapa chumba cha chap chap, kwa kuwa walikuwa katika eneo la baa mahali hapo wakinywa bia, na kuomba wakaguliwe na walinzi.	he says "the good news is that, when I complained that my money had been stolen, the waiter called those involved to whom he gave the room for a short time, as they were in the bar area where they were drinking beer, and he requested that they be checked by the guards.
<33>	Ukaguzi ulifanikisha kupata fedha zangu kwa kuwa walizichukua zikiwa kwenye wallet (pochi ya wanaume)”.	after checking, they succeeded in finding my money, for the people had taken it and it was in their wallet (male purse).
<34>	Kileo yeye anasema wahudumu walimtumia wezi akagundua mapema na kuhama.	Kileo says the waiters sent him thieves, and he realized early and moved out.
<35>	Ushauri wangu kwa wahudumu; badilikeni.	my advice to the waiters - change.
