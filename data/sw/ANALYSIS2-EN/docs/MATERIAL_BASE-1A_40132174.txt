<4>	Patrick Nyaga Chege, ambaye ni naibu kamishna anayesimamia wilaya ya Uriri katika kaunti ya Migori alipatikana na hatia ya kumlaghai Bw Bernard Oyugi kiasi cha Sh470,000 mwaka wa 2011.	Patrick Nyaga Chege, who is an assistant commissioner managing the Uriri District in Migori County, was found guilty of defrauding Mister Bernard Oyugi of an amount of 470,000 shillings in the year 2011.
<5>	Awali, mahakama iliambiwa kuwa Bw Chege alijipatia fedha hizo kutoka kwa Bw Oyugi kama mkopo wa kirafiki alipokuwa mkuu wa wilaya ya Mwingi miaka minne iliyopita kabla ya kuhamishiwa Na KITAVI MUTUA kaunti ya Migori.	initially, the court was told that Mister Chege gave himself the money from Mister Oyugi as a friendly loan when he was the head of the Mwingi District four years ago, before being transferred by Kitavi Mutua, Migori County.
<6>	Kamishna huyo alitiwa mbaroni alipokuwa afisini mapema wiki iliyopita kabla ya kusafirishwa umbali wa kilometa 600 kwenda kufunguliwa mashtaka katika kaunti ya Kitui.	the commissioner was arrested when he was in the office early last week, before being transported a distance of 600 kilometers to be charged in Kitui County.
<7>	Mahakama ilitoa kibali cha kukamatwa kwake baada ya kukataa kutii mialiko ya kumtaka afike kortini.	the court gave a warrant for his arrest after he refused to obey summons to appear in court.
<8>	Hakimu Margaret Murage alimhukumu Chege kifungo cha siku 30 katika gereza la Waita baada ya kushindwa kushawishi mahakama kuwa alishindwa kulipa mlalamishi fedha zake.	Judge Margaret Murage sentenced Chege to a jail term of 30 days in Waita Prison after he failed to convince the court that he was unable to pay the complainant his money.
<9>	Gereza hilo liko katika eneo la Mumoni ambapo aliwahi kuhudumu kama Afisa wa Divisheni (DO).	the prison is in the Mumoni area, where he ever served as the divisional officer (DO).
<10>	“Mshtakiwa ni sharti awekwe kwenye gereza hadi Januari 15 ambapo atafikishwa tena mahakamani kutoa ripoti ikiwa amelipa fedha hizo au la,” akasema hakimu.	the defendant must be kept in jail until January 15th, when he will be brought to court again to give a statement, whether he has paid the money or not, said the judge.
<11>	Mahakama, hata hivyo, ilikataa ombi la afisa huyo kuwa kumfunga kungeaibisha serikali kwa kuwa alikuwa mtumishi wa umma.	the court, however, refused a plea by the officer that jailing him would shame the government because he was a public servant.
<12>	Bw Chege aliomba mahakama kumwachilia kutokana na kigezo kuwa alifaa kufanya maandalizi ya siku ya Jamhuri Dei katika eneo lake.	Mister Chege pleaded with the court to release him on the criterion that he was meant to do preparations for Independence Day celebrations.
<13>	Alidaiwa kuwa alichukua mkopo kutoka kwa Bw Oyugi baada ya kukabiliwa na mahakama ya watoto kwa kushindwa kuhudumia mke na watoto wake.	he was alleged to have taken the loan from Mister Oyugi after being confronted by the Children's Court for failing to attend to his wife and children.
