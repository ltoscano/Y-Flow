<1>	Wakuzaji wa mihogo watoa wito juu ya soko	cassava farmers are calling on the market
<2>	Na KAZUNGU SAMUEL	by Kazungu Samuel
<3>	WAKULIMA wa mihogo katika Kilifi sasa wanaitaka serikali ya kaunti hiyo kuweka mikakati bora ya soko la bidhaa zao.	cassava farmers in Kilifi now want the county government to put in place proper market strategies for their produce.
<4>	Hatua hiyo ni katika juhudi mpya za kujikimu kutoka kwa zao hilo ambalo linadhaminiwa zaidi kuliko mahindi.	the move is towards a new course of self-sufficiency from the produce, which is valued more than maize.
<5>	Wakulima wa kundi la Basi Mwangaza la Tezo walisema kuwa licha ya juhudi zao za kuongeza uzalishaji wa mihogo, hofu yao ni jinsi watakavyoweza kupata soko la bidhaa hiyo.	farmers from Basi Mwangaza la Tezo group said that, despite their efforts to increase cassava production, their worry is how they will manage to get a market for the product.
<6>	Mmoja wa wakulima Hashim Omar alisema katika kijiji cha Mikingirini juzi kwamba aliogneza ekari zake za mihigo na sasa ana jumla ya ekari 210 ambazo amepanda zao hilo.	one of the farmers, Hashim Omar of Mikingirini village, said the day before yesterday that he increased his acres of cassava, and now has a total of 210 acres that he has planted and that produce.
<7>	Hata hivyo, alisema kuwa anatumainia serikali ya kaunti kutafuta soko la bidhaa zake.	nevertheless, he said his hope is on the county government to find a market for his produce.
<8>	“Nimeongeza ekari zangu ambazo nilikuwa awali nikipinda mimea mingine.	"I have added my acres that I previously was planting with other crops.
<9>	Kwa sasa ninaendeleza kilimo cha mihogo.	for now, I am progressing in the cultivation of cassava.
<10>	Hata hivyo, tatizo ni soko na na natumai serikali ya kaunti itatusaidia,” akasema.	however, the challenge is the market, and I'm hopeful that the county government will help us," he said.
<11>	Wakati huo huo, wakulima hao walishtushwa na hatua ya serikali ya kaunti kupendekeza ujenzi wa kiwanda cha kutayarisha mihogo katika eneo la Tezo badala ya Mikingirini.	at the same time, farmers were astonished by the county government's move to recommend the construction of a factory for processing cassava in the Tezo area, instead of Mikingirini.
<12>	Walisema kiwanda hicho kilifaa kujengwa Mikingirini kwa sababu kuna wakulima wengi kuliko kituo cha biashara cha Tezo ambako ni mbali na wakulima ni wachache.	they said that the factory was supposed to be constructed at Mikingirini because it has more farmers than at Tezo trading center, which is far away and has few farmers.
<13>	‘‘Wakulima wengi wa mihogo wanatoka maeneo ya Mikingirini, Mtondia na Kakanjuni.	"many cassava farmers come from the Mikingirini, Mtondia and Kakanjuni areas.
<14>	Tulikuwa tumetaka kiwanda hicho kijengwe eneo la Mikingirini, lakini kikapelekwa eneo la Tezo,” akasema mmoja wa wakulima hao.	we wanted that factory to be constructed in the Mikingirini area, but it was taken to the Tezo area," said one of the farmers.
<15>	Hata hivyo, akiongea afisini mwake jana, waziri wa kilimo katika Kaunti ya Kilifi Mwalimu Menza alipinga dhana hiyo ya wakulima hao.	however, speaking from his office yesterday, the Minister of Agriculture in Kilifi County, Mwalimu Menza, opposed the idea of those farmers.
