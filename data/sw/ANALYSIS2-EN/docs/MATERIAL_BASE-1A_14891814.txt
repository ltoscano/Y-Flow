<1>	Wachezaji wetu na ‘vitu’ vya ziada!	our players and 'extra' things!
<2>	May 31, 2012	31st May, 2012.
<3>	MWAKA 1979 timu ya Pan Afrika ya Dar es Salaam ilipangwa kukutana na timu ya AS Vita ya Zaire kwenye raundi ya pili ya michuano ya Kombe la Washindi Afrika katika mchezo uliopangwa kufanyika kwenye Uwanja wa Sheikh Amri Abeid mjini Arusha.	in the year 1979, the Pan-African Team of Dar es Salaam was set to meet with the AS Vita Team of Zaire in the second round of the African Winners Cup in a game that was planned to take place at the Sheikh Amri Abeid Stadium in Arusha Town.
<4>	Timu hizi zilikuwa zinashiriki michuano hiyo ya pili kwa ukubwa baada ya ile ya klabu bingwa ya Afrika, na ilishirikisha timu zilizoshika nafasi za pili kwenye ligi za nchi zao.	these teams were participating in the second-round competitions of the Africa Championships Club, involving teams that held the second position in the leagues in their countries.
<5>	Hata hivyo, Pan ilikuwa inashiriki michuano hiyo kutokana na kuwa bingwa wa michuano ya mtoano ya Kombe la Nyerere ambayo sasa haipo tena.	however, Pan-Africa was participating in the competitions because it was the champion of the Nyerere Cup Elimination Championship which no longer exists.
<6>	Ili kujiimarisha na mpambano huo dhidi ya timu hiyo ya Zaire ambayo ilikuwa ‘inatisha’ miaka hiyo, Pan Afrika iliamua kumuita mchezaji wake Sunday Manara ‘computer’ aliyekuwa akicheza soka ya kulipwa huko Austria.	in order to draw equal in the competition against the Zaire Team which was intimidating during those years, Pan-Africa decided to call on its player, Sunday Manara 'the computer', who was playing soccer professionally in Austria.
<7>	Kumbukumbu hazielezi vyema iliwezekanaje kwa Sunday kuweza kuja ‘kusaidia’ klabu ya nchini mwake katika michuano ya soka inayosimamiwa na FIFA, sio kwa uhamisho rasmi, huku akiwa amesajiliwa na klabu nyingine iliyokuwa inashiriki ligi ya Austria ambayo ilikua pia mwanachama wa FIFA.	records do not clearly explain how it was possible for Sunday to come 'help' the club in his country in soccer competitions that were supervised by FIFA, not on official transfer, while on contract with another club which was participating in Austria League and which was also a member of FIFA.
<8>	Iwavyo vyovyote, mipango ya kumleta Sunday Manara nchini ili ‘kuipa tafu’ timu ya Pan Afrika ikakamilika, lakini kwa bahati mbaya mchezaji huyo hakuweza kuwasili mapema na badala yake akafika kwenye uwanja wa ndege wa Kilimanjaro International saa chache kabla mchezo huo kuanza.	regardless, the plans to bring Sunday Manara to the country to boost the Pan-Africa team were carried out, but unfortunately the player was not able to arrive early and instead he arrived at the Kilimanjaro International Airport a few hours before the start of the match.
<9>	Pamoja na uchovu wa safari ya ndege ya saa zaidi ya 36, Sunday Manara alikuwa miongoni mwa wachezaji walioanza mpambano huo na akafanya ‘vitu’ vilivyotegemewa kutoka kwake; ingawa baadhi ya wapenzi waliouona mpambano ule wanakubaliana kuwa kadri muda ulivyokwenda ndivyo uchovu wa safari aliokuwa nao ulivyojionyesha.	exhausted from a flight journey of more than 36 hours, Sunday Manara was among the players who opened the match and did the 'things' that were expected of him; although some of the fans who watched the match agree that as time went by, the exhaustion from the journey started to show itself.
<10>	Timu ya Pan Afrika ilishinda mchezo huo kwa magoli 2-1 lakini ikatolewa kwenye michuano hiyo baada ya kufungwa bao 1-0 na Vita wiki mbili baadaye mjini Kinshasa.	the Pan-African team won the game 2-1 but it was removed from the championship after being beaten 1-0 by Vita two weeks later in Kinshasa City.
<11>	Pamoja na timu ya Pan Afrika kuwa imekamilika kwenye idara ya kiungo kutokana na kuwa na wachezaji mahiri kama Mohamed Adolf, Salum ‘Carlos’ Mwinyimkuu, Muhaji Mukhi na wengineo, bado uongozi wa klabu hiyo uliona umuhimu wa kumvusha mabara mchezaji huyo kuja nchini kuisaidia klabu hiyo.	together with the Pan-African team being strong in the midfielders unit from having skilled players like Mohamed Adolf, Salum 'Carlos' Mwinyimkuu, Muhaji Mukhi and others, the club's leaders saw the importance of getting the player across borders to come to the country to help the club.
<12>	Huyu alikuwa ni mchezaji aliyekuwa na uwezo wa ziada kiwanjani ambaye kitendo chake kimoja tu katika wakati usiotegemewa kingeweza kubadilisha sura ya mchezo.	he was a player who had exemplary ability on the field and whose one action at an unpredictable time could change the face of the game.
<13>	Mara kadhaa alipata kuhojiwa huko nyuma na vyombo vya habari na kusema kuwa siri kubwa ya uwezo wake ilikuwa ni kufanya ziada ya kile alichokuwa akifundisha mwalimu wake wa soka.	at various times he had been interviewed in the past by the media and said that the biggest secret to his ability was to do more than what his soccer coach was teaching.
<14>	Kwamba kama mazoezi rasmi ya timu yalikuwa yanaanza saa kumi, basi, yeye angefika kiwanjani saa tisa na kuanza kujifua kwa mazoezi binafsi kabla ya kujiunga na wenzake kwa mazoezi ya pamoja.	if the official training session for the team was to start at four o'clock, then he would arrive at three o'clock and start doing his own extra training before joining the others for group training.
<15>	Katika miaka ya karibuni mchezaji mwingine aliyepata kuwa na sifa hii ya kuwa na ziada ya kujifua ni aliyepata kuwa beki mashuhuri wa Simba, Boniface Pawasa.	in recent years, another player who came to have such a reputation of doing extra training is the once-famous Simba defender, Boniface Pawasa.
<16>	Majuzi pia tumesikia pia kocha wa taifa wa nchi moja ya jirani akimsifia mchezaji Shadrack Nsajigwa kuwa ana uwezo mkubwa wa kumaliza dakika 90 za mchezo akipanda na kushuka kwa kasi ile ile aliyoanza nayo.	recently, we also heard the national coach of a neighboring country praising the player Shadrack Nsajigwa for his impressive ability to complete 90 minutes of the game running up and down the field with the same speed he started with.
<17>	Ni vitu vya ziada kama hivi vinavyomtofautisha mchezaji mmoja na wenzake wengi, na pia kuwa katika nafasi nzuri ya kuonekana na ‘scouts’ wa timu za nje.	it is the extra things such as these that differentiate one player from many others, and also put him in a good position to be spotted by 'scouts' of foreign teams.
<18>	Hivi karibuni timu ya Tanzania Bara (Kilimanjaro Stars) iliwasili mjini Dar es Salaam ikitokea Uganda ilikoshiriki michuano ya Challenge Cup ambapo ilishika nafasi ya tatu na kujitwalia zawadi ya dola 10,000.	recently, the Tanzanian Mainland Team (Kilimanjaro Stars) arrived in Dar es Salaam from Uganda, where it participated in the contest for the Challenge Cup, in which it held the third position and scooped up a prize of 10,000 dollars.
<19>	Taarifa zinasema kuwa mara tu baada ya kuwasili kwenye uwanja wa ndege wa Julius Nyerere, mshambuliaji wa timu ya Simba, Mussa Hassan Mgosi alichukua begi lake na kwenda moja kwa moja uwanja wa Taifa wa zamani ambako timu yake ya Simba ilikuwa inacheza mechi ya kirafiki na timu ya ZESCO kutoka Zambia.	reports say that just after arriving at the Julius Nyerere Airport, the striker from the Simba Team, Mussa Hassan Mgosi, took his bag and went directly to the old national stadium where his old team Simba was playing a friendly match with the Zesco Team from Zambia.
<20>	Mchezaji huyo si tu kwamba aliingia kipindi cha pili cha mchezo huo na kuongeza kasi ya mashambulizi ya timu yake dhidi ya ZESCO; bali pia aliweza kuifungia bao katika dakika ya 87 ya mchezo na kuiwezesha kutoka suluhu ya mabao 1-1 na timu hiyo kutoka Zambia.	the player not only played during the second half of the game and increased the speed for his team against Zesco, he also scored a goal in the 87th minute, and enabled the team to achieve a draw of 1-1 with the team from Zambia.
<21>	Napenda kuamini kuwa kabla ya mchezaji huyo kuingia kiwanjani kocha wa timu alimuuliza kama angeweza kucheza mchezo huo kutokana na kuwa ametoka safari na yeye kukubali.	I love to believe that before the player came onto the field, the team's coach asked him if he would be able to play given that he had just come from a journey and he agreed.
<22>	Kuna uwezekano mkubwa pia kuwa aliomba mwenyewe kucheza kwenye mechi hiyo.	there is also a huge possibility that he himself requested to play in the game.
<23>	Iwavyo vyovyote, kitendo cha mchezaji huyo kuingia kiwanjani saa chache tu baada ya safari ni miongoni mwa vile ‘vitu’ vya ziada vinavyomtofautisha mchezaji hodari na wachezaji wengine wa kawaida.	regardless, the act of that player to go onto the field just a few hours after a journey is among the 'extra' things that differentiate a capable player from many common players.
<24>	Ni vyema wachezaji wetu wa soka wakaiga mfano wa kitendo hiki na vingine vinavyofanana navyo iwapo wana nia ya kufanikiwa kwenye ulimwengu wa soka.	it would be good if our soccer players followed the example of this act and many other similar examples if they intend to succeed in the world of soccer.
<25>	Sisemi kwamba wachezaji wote wa taifa siku ile wangebeba mabegi yao na kuelekea viwanjani kuchezea timu zao zilizokuwa na mechi ili kujitofautisha na wenzao, la hasha.	I'm not saying that all Taifa players should have carried their bags and headed to the fields that day to play for their teams that had matches so as to differentiate themselves from the others, not at all.
<26>	Yapo mambo mengi tu ambayo mchezaji anaweza kufanya ili kujitofautisha na wengine.	there are many things that a player can do to differentiate himself from the others.
<27>	Tumesikia kila mara jinsi wachezaji wetu wa soka wanapohojiwa wanavyoeleza mipango yao ya kutaka kuwa wachezaji wa kulipwa kwenye klabu za nchi zilizoendelea kisoka.	we have heard every time how our soccer players, when interviewed, explain their plans to be professional players in clubs from countries that are advanced in soccer.
<28>	Miaka ya nyuma kuna hata wachezaji walioondoka nchini kwa mbwembwe kwenda kufanya majaribio kwenye nchi hizo, lakini wakarudi kimya kimya na kuendelea na ligi zetu bila kutuambia kwa uwazi ni nini hasa kilichowasibu huko walikokwenda na kusababisha kushindwa kukamilisha ndoto zao.	in the past years, there are players who have left the country in style to try out in those countries, but they returned in silence and continued with our leagues without telling us openly what exactly they faced where they went and what caused them to fail when pursuing their dreams.
<29>	Zipo zimulizi za mitaani zisizokuwa na mashiko zenye kueleza kuwa wengi wa wachezaji wetu walishindwa majaribio yao kutokana na ufahamu wao mdogo wa lugha ya kimataifa ya mawasiliano ya Kiingereza.	there are rumors in the streets that are not verifiable which explain that many of our players failed their trials as a result of their little knowledge of English, the international language of communication. 
<30>	Ni vigumu kuamini simulizi hizi kutokana na ukweli kwamba kuna wachezaji wengi tu, kwa mfano, kwenye ligi maarufu ulimwenguni ya Barclays ya Uingereza wanaotoka nchi mbalimbali ulimwenguni ambao Kiingereza chao cha ‘kuombea mpira’, achilia mbali cha kuombea maji, ni matatizo matupu; lakini wanavuta mshahara wa paundi 20,000 hadi 30,000 ambazo ni sawa na ‘madafu’ yetu milioni sitini, kwa wiki!	it is hard to believe these stories due to the fact that there are so many players. for example, in the famous worldwide European Barclays League, there are players who come from various countries and whose English is similar to 'asking for ball' let alone asking for water, which is total trouble; but they are scooping up salaries of 20,000 to 30,000 which are equivalent to our sixty million 'coconuts' in a week.
<31>	Ni wazi basi kuwa iwapo mchezaji atakuwa na uwezo wa kufanya vitu vya ziada awapo uwanjani vinavyoweza kuchangia timu yake kupata ushindi, lugha itakuwa ni kitu kidogo sana kwa makocha na mameneja wa timu wanaosaka na kununua wachezaji kwa ajili ya timu.	it is evident that if a player has the ability to do something more on the field which can contribute to his team's victory, the language barrier becomes insignificant to coaches and managers of the teams who are searching to buy players for the sake of the team.
<32>	Tujiulize.	let's ask ourselves:
<33>	Je tunao wachezaji wenye uwezo wa kucheza mechi ya ligi ya Barclays, Jumamosi, Uingereza na Jumanne usiku akacheza dhidi ya klabu ya Ujerumani kwenye kombe la mabingwa, Ijumaa akawa uwanjani Uingereza akiichezea timu yake kwenye kombe la ligi na Jumatatu usiku akawa anakipiga kwenye mechi ya kombe la Barclays?	do we have players who have the ability to play in the Barclays League on Saturday in Europe and on Tuesday night against the German club in the Championships Cup, to be on the field on Friday in Europe playing for their team in the League Cup and on Saturday night playing in a match in the Barclays's Cup?
<34>	Tunao?	do we have them?
<35>	Tunapokuwa na wachezaji wanaosifiwa na makocha wa timu za mataifa mengine juu ya uwezo wao wa kucheza dakika 90 za mchezo kwa kasi ile ile na wachezaji wenye moyo kiasi cha kuweza kutoka kwenye michuano ya kimataifa na kufikia uwanjani kwenye mechi ya klabu zao, tunapata matumaini kuwa siku si nyingi zijazo tutakuwa na Mtanzania mwenzetu akitesa kwenye ligi za kimataifa.	when we have players being praised by the coaches of other nations' teams because of their ability to play 90 minutes of the game at the same speed and players who are motivated to the extent of being able to come from international championships and arrive on the field for their club's matches, we get hope that it won't be long until we will have a fellow Tanzanian causing distress in international leagues.
<36>	Na nafasi ya kufanya hivyo ipo wazi kwa Vijana wetu kupitia ‘dirisha dogo la usajili’ ambalo ni michuano ya CHAN inayoanza mwezi huu huko Ivory Coast.	the opportunity to do so is open to our youths through the small window of registration which is the CHAN Championships starting this month in the Ivory Coast.
