<2>	(1.605-21.399)	hivi kwa chuo cha Makerere imekuwa ni Kambi ya polisi wa kukabiliana na ghasia maanake hakuna raia wowote -- yeyote anayestahili kuingia katika chuo hicho na ni maafisa wa polisi ambao wamekizingira nje na ndani na kuchukua usimamizi wa chuo kizima kila mwanafunzi akiwa ameondolewa .	as of now Makerere University has become a police camp of countering chaos because there are no citizens that are allowed to go into that university and it is only police officers who have surrounded it from outside and inside taking over the management of the whole university with every student having been removed .
<3>	(21.399-33.109)	wale ambao wameripotiwa hawana nauli ya kwenda makwao wamechukuliwa na polisi na kuwekwa katika katika ma- -- <hes> -- katika vituo vya polisi kuwapa hifadhi ya muda <sta> wanaodai kwamba hawana nauli .	those reported to have lacked fare to their homes have been taken by the police and put in -- those claiming that they have no fare have been put in police stations and offered temporary accommodation .
<4>	(33.109-61.500)	wale ambao walikuwa wanajaribu tena kuiba ghasia kwamba hakuna wanakokwenda na kufungwa kwa chuo wanasema ni kinyume cha sheria hao wamechukuliwa na maafisa wa polisi wa kuzuia ghasia ikiripotiwa zaidi ya hamsini (()) wanafunzi wamekamatwa na watu wawili ikiwamo mwandishi wa habari wamepata majeraha kutokana na fujo ambazo wanafunzi wame- -- wameanzisha hivyo jana kufikia leo asubuhi .	those who were trying again to steal and cause chaos that they were going nowhere and that the closure of the university was unlawful have been taken by the police to avoid chaos as it is being reported that more that fifty (()) students have been arrested and two people including a journalist have been injured from the chaos which the students caused since yesterday until today morning .
<5>	(61.500-72.398)	na ninavyozungumza ni <sta> kwamba wahadhiri wamekataa kata kata kwamba hawatarejea madarasani kuweza kufunza kabla hawajapewa marupurupu yao ya miezi tisa .	and what I am saying is that lecturers have completely refused to go back to class to teach before they have been given their nine months' benefits .
<6>	(72.398-81.690)	hii leo ilikuwa imekubaliwa kwamba <sta> wapewe marupurupu ya mwezi mmoja miezi mwingine nane ikiweza kujadiliwa lakini hilo wamekataa haliwezekani .	today it had been agreed that they would be given one month's benefits and get the eight months' ones when discussed but they are adamant that it is impossible .
<7>	(81.690-110.680)	na vio- -- uongozi wa -- wa wanafunzi nao wameweza kufika katika afisi za Wizara ya elimu mbele ya waziri Janet Museveni ambaye ni bwa- -- bibiye Museveni wanafunzi hao wakiongozwa na Roy Ssembogga wakitaka hali ya masomo kurejelea katika Chuo Kikuu cha Makerere wakisema wamelipa ada hivyo bado hali hivi ni ya ku- -- kuvuta na kuvuta vuta nivute .	and -- the leaders of -- of the students have arrived at the ministry of education's offices in front of the minister Janet Museveni who is Museveni's wife the students led by Roy Ssembogga urging the state of learning to return at the Makerere University saying they have paid fees and at the moment the situation is still in a tug of war .
<8>	(110.680-127.501)	hau- -- hakujapatikana mwafaka ama njia ambayo tunaweza sema huu ndiyo mwelekeo . <lipsmack> lakini leo mchana kuna taarifa kwamba serikali iliweza kutangaza ku eh wapatia wahadhiri baadhi ya yale madai yao .	no agreement or a way has been found that we can say is the directive but the government today afternoon announced that yes it will give the lecturers some of their dues .
<9>	(127.501-129.654)	hili likoje na ukweli wake uko vipi ?	how is this and how is its truth ?
<10>	(129.654-132.060)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<11>	(132.060-140.664)	ndiyo hilo ninalozungumzia kwamba serikali ilikuwa imefanya mkutano uliongozwa na doctor Etyang ambao %incomplete	that is what I am talking about that the government had done a meeting that was led by Doctor Etyang which %incomplete
<12>	(140.664-151.140)	serikali ikasema kwamba itaweza kuwalipa wahadhiri mwezi mmoja kati ya miezi tisa hivyo miezi nane iweze kusubiriwa wataweza kulipwa baadaye .	the government said that it will be able to pay lecturers for one out of the nine months and wait for the eight months to be paid later .
<13>	(151.140-152.022)	lakini wahadhiri %incomplete	but lecturers %incomplete
<14>	(152.022-155.460)	tunavyozungumza muungano wa wahadhiri uko katika mkutano .	as we speak the union of lecturers is in a meeting .
<15>	(155.460-186.270)	habari za mwanzo zikieleza kwamba hawatakubaliana na huo mwelekeo wa serikali na linalostahili ni kulipwa marupurupu yao yote ya miezi tisa ikitiliwa kwa maanani kwamba huu ni mkataba ambao ume sainiwa mwaka elfu mbili kumi na tatu kwamba wahadhiri wa Chuo Kikuu cha Makerere waongezewe mshahara waongezewe marupurupu kwa asilimia sabini na Rais Museveni akakubali kwamba hilo litatekelezwa mwaka elfu mbili kumi na tatu tunazungumzia mwaka elfu mbili kumi na sita .	initial reports explaining that they will not agree to the government's direction and what is desirable is getting all their nine months' benefits paid attaching the importance that this is an agreement that was signed in the year two thousand and thirteen for the lecturers of Makerere University should get a seventy percent increase in salary and benefits and President Museveni agreed that this will be implemented in the year two thousand and thirteen and we are talking of the year two thousand and six .
<16>	(186.270-198.263)	hivyo wengine wakidadisi kwamba elfu mbili kumi na tatu ilikuwa tu ni ahadi ya Museveni ya kisiasa ambaye ameshindwa kutimiza na kuagiza tena chuo kifu- -- kifungwe kabla ya kutimiza ahadi hiyo .	some are speculating that two thousand and thirteen was just Museveni's political promise who has been unable to fulfill it and has ordered to have the university shut down before fulfilling that promise .
<17>	(198.263-205.273)	hilo bado hili halijapata mwafaka mwezi mmoja wa kulipwa marupurupu wahadhiri umekataliwa .	therefore this has not yet found a solution as the lecturers have rejected the one month's benefits pay .
<18>	(205.273-206.320)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<19>	(206.320-219.260)	sasa <hes> hivi jana ambapo <hes> Rais Museveni anafunga chuo hicho <breath> aliweka bayana muda wa kufungwa kwa sababu tunafahamu mwaka wa masomo ndiyo kwanza pengine unaanza hivi sasa ?	now yesterday as President Museveni shut down the university did he specify the length of the closure as we understand that the year of study has perhaps just began ?
<20>	(219.260-222.172)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<21>	(222.172-237.400)	aliandika <sta> taarifa ya haya moja tu akisema anafunga Chuo Kikuu kulingana na idara ya ishirini na sita sehemu ya pili ya mamlaka yanayosimamia uongozi wa vyuo vikuu sababu kuu aliyonukuu ni kwamba <breath> analinda mali ya umma na maisha ya binadamu .	he wrote a one paragraph statement saying he is closing the university in accordance to the twenty sixth article of the administration overseeing the management of universities quoting the biggest reason as protecting public property and human lives .
<22>	(237.400-272.803)	mkuu wa polisi generali Kale Kayihura ambaye sasa amesimamia usalama wa Chuo Kikuu cha Makerere yeye mwenyewe ndiye kamanda pia amesema mengi akaweza kusema kwamba serikali haikuwa na lingine la kufanya kwa sababu mbinu zote ambazo ingechukua kuweza kuwazuia wahadhiri na wanafunzi kufanya fujo mgomo kuisha hazikufua dafu na hivyo ilikuwa imesalia na <sta> na -- na -- na jawabu moja tu kufunga Chuo Kikuu ili mali na maisha zisije zikaharibika .	the head of police General Kale Kayihura now overseeing the security of Makerere University and also the commander has said much that there was nothing else the government could have done because all the strategies it could have taken to stop the lecturers and the students from causing chaos and ending the strike were not successful and therefore it was left with only one answer to shut down the university so that properties and lives could be preserved .
<23>	(272.803-274.375)	<lipsmack> lakini migomo kama .	but if strikes like .
