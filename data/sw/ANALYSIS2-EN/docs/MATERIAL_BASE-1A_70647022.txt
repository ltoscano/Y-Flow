<1>	Watanzania si wavivu, tatizo mfumo	Tanzanians are not lazy, the problem is the system.
<2>	Tatizo la Watanzania si uvivu bali ni mfumo.	the problem of Tanzanians is not laziness but the system.
<3>	Karibu asilimia 80 ya Watanzania ni wakulima wa kujikimu, hawa wangekuwa wavivu wangeshakufa na familia zao.	about 80 percent of Tanzanians are subsistence farmers, if they were lazy, they would have died with their families.
<4>	Vijana wengi wamekimbilia mjini kwani kilimo hakilipi.	many youths have ran to town because farming doesn't pay.
<5>	Kauli mbiu ya Hapa Kazi Tu bila kuwekeza kwenye kilimo itakuwa porojo tulizozizoea.	the slogan "here it's just work" without investing in farming will be the usual empty talk that we're used to.
<6>	Bila skimu za umwagiliaji, sayansi na teknolojia kwenye kilimo, pembejeo za kilimo na masoko ya uhakika na yenye kuwanufaisha wakulima, tutabaki kukariri mashairi ya Watanzania eti ni wavivu.	without irrigation schemes, science and technology in agriculture, farming fertilizer and guaranteed markets beneficial to farmers, we will keep reciting poems on how lazy Tanzanians are.
<7>	Ni aibu hata kupewa misaada ya chakula na nchi kama Vietnam, ni aibu kubwa.	it is shameful to even get food aid from countries like Vietnam, it's a big shame.
<8>	Nchi yenye ardhi na maji mengi kushindwa kujitosheleza kwa chakula ni aibu.	it is a shame for a country with lots of land and a lot of water to fail in sustaining itself food-wise.
<9>	Misri wana uhakika wa chakula kwa kutegemea chanzo kimoja tu cha maji ambacho ni Mto Nile.	Egypt has food security from depending on only one water source which is River Nile.
<10>	Hivi tumelaaniwa au tumerogwa?	are we cursed or bewitched?
