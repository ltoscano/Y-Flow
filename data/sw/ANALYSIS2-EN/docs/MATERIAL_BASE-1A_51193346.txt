<4>	HATIMAYE Yanga imekubali kuilipa Simba Sh milioni 200 kumaliza utata wa Hassan Kessy kudaiwa kuvunja mkataba na klabu yake ya zamani Simba.	Yanga has finally agreed to pay Simba 200 million shillings to clear Hassan Kessy's dispute of claims that he violated the contract with his former club Simba.
<5>	Awali, Simba ilimlalamikia mchezaji Hassan Kessy kwa kuvunja mkataba na kudai kulipwa thamani ya mkataba ambayo ni zaidi ya dola laki sita, lakini baada ya mazungumzo Yanga wamekubali kulipa asilimia 10 ya mkataba.	initially, Simba complained about player Hassan Kessy breaking the contract and asking to be paid the contract's full value, which is more than six hundred thousand dollars, but after negotiation, Yanga have agreed to pay 10 percent of the contract.
<6>	Akizungumza na waandishi wa habari jana, Ofisa Habari wa Shirikisho la Soka Tanzania (TFF) alisema Yanga iliwakilishwa na Kaimu Katibu Mkuu, Baraka Deusdedit na Simba iliwasilishwa na Mwenyekiti wa Kamati ya Usajili, Zacharia Hanspope.	while speaking with the media yesterday, the Tanzanian football federation (TFF) communication officer said Yanga was represented by the vice chief director, Baraka Deusdedit, and Simba by the chairman of the signatory committee, Zacharia Hanspope.
<7>	“Pamoja na kutokuwepo kwa msuluhishi Said El-Maamry, haikuzuia pande hizo mbili kuendelea na mazungumzo, mazungumzo yalikuwa ni yenye mafanikio licha ya kutokuwepo msuluhishi”, alisema Lucas.	"the absence of arbitrator Said El-Maamry did not bar both sides from proceeding with the talk. the talk was successful, despite the absence of an arbitrator," said Lucas.
<8>	Lucas alisema walikubaliana kufika kikomo wikiendi hii kwa muda na sehemu wanayoijua wao ili waweze kumalizana kabisa kwa sababu wamekubaliana kuwekeza sehemu ili kulipa fidia na kumaliza utata wa kile ambacho Simba imekuwa ikikilalamikia.	Lucas said that they agreed to reach the end of this weekend at a time and place they know best so that they can settle completely, because they have agreed to invest a portion so that they can pay charges and finish the dispute, which is what Simba has been complaining about.
<9>	Ili kuepuka suala hili kurudi kwenye kamati ya Sheria na hadhi za wachezaji hawa viongozi wamekubali kumaliza na kuandika ripoti na kuileta TFF Jumatatu.	in order to avoid such issues coming back to the legal committee and players' ethics, these leaders have agreed to write and finish a report to the TFF on Monday.
<10>	“Licha ya tofauti walizo nazo wanapokuwa uwanjani, na utani wao wa jadi ulivyo walikubaliani vizuri kuondoa utata na madai ambayo Simba iliwasilisha na kuona Yanga pakoja na Kessy walifanya makosa,” alisema Lucas.	"despite the differences they have while on the field, and their great sarcasm, they agreed to do away with the dispute and claims presented by Simba and to see that Yanga and Kessy were wrong," said Lucas.
<11>	Awali Simba ilipeleka shauri kwenye Kamati ya Katiba, Sheria na Hadhi za Wachezaji kuwa mchezaji Hassan Kessy Juni 27 mwaka huu alivunja mkataba kwa kitendo cha kuonekana akiwa na timu ya Yanga ilihali mkataba wake ukiwa haujamalizika Simba.	earlier, Simba took an issue to the constitution, law and ethics committee for players, claiming that Hassan Kessy on June 27th this year broke a contract by appearing with the Yanga team while his contract had not ended.
<12>	Kamati baada ya kupokea shauri hilo iliagiza pande za Simba na Yanga kumaliza suala hilo tangu Septemba, lakini kwa sababu zilizo nje ya TFF na kamati kuamua kulipa msuluhishi ambaye alikuwa ni Said El-Maamry.	after, the committee received the recommendation that directed the Simba and Yanga sides to end the dispute in September, but for reasons beyond TFF and the committee deciding to pay the arbiter, who was Said El-Maamry.
