<3>	TANZANIA inatarajia kupata mgawo wa takribani shilingi bilioni 400 kutokana na mauzo ya hisa yaliyofanywa na kampuni ya Ophir kwa kampuni ya Pavillion katika vitalu vya gesi vilivyopo nchini, Raia Mwema limeambiwa.	Tanzania expects to get a share of approximately 400 billion shillings from sale of Ophir company shares to Pavillion in the gas blocks which are in the country, Raia Mwema has written.
<4>	Kampuni ya Ophir inamiliki asilimia 40 ya hisa katika vitalu namba 1, 3 na 4 huku asilimia nyingine 60 ikimilikiwa na kampuni ya BG, lakini Ophir wameamua kuuza hisa zao 20, mwaka huu.	the company Ophir owns 40 percent of the shares in blocks number 1, 3 and 4 while the other 60 percent is owned by BG, however, Ophir have decided to sell 20% of their shares this year.
<5>	Mauzo ya hisa hizo yanatarajiwa kuiingizia Ophir kiasi cha dola bilioni 1.3 (shilingi trilioni mbili) na kutokana na mauzo hayo, Tanzania itapata kiasi cha dola milioni 260 (shilingi bilioni 400) kama kodi.	the sales of those shares are expected to get Ophir an amount of 1.3 billion dollars (two trillion shillings) and from the sales, Tanzania will get an amount of 260 million dollars (400 billion shillings) through tax.
<6>	Hii itakuwa ni mara ya kwanza kwa Tanzania kufaidika na mauzo ya hisa za rasilimali zake kupitia Kodi ya Ongezeko la Mtaji (Capital Gain Tax) ambayo ilipitishwa na Bunge mwaka jana.	this will be the first time Tanzania benefits from the sales of shares from its resources through the capital gains tax that was passed by the parliament last year.
<7>	Kodi hiyo ilipitishwa na Sheria ya Fedha (Finance Act) ya mwaka 2012 baada ya kuwasilishwa kama mapendekezo binafsi na Mbunge wa Kigoma Kaskazini (CHADEMA), Zitto Kabwe na kisha Bunge kuridhia.	the tax was passed by the finance act for the year 2012 after being presented as a private bill by Kigoma North member of parliament (Chadema), Zitto Kabwe, and after the parliament approved it.
<8>	Katika miaka ya nyuma, Tanzania haikuwa ikifaidika na mauzo yoyote ya hisa kwa makampuni yanayouziana rasilimali zake kwa sababu Kodi hiyo ya Ongezeko la Mtaji haikuwepo.	in the past years, Tanzania hasn't benefitted from any sale of shares to companies that trade in their resources because there was no capital gains tax.
<9>	Kwa sababu mauzo hayo ya hisa yana thamani ya dola hizo bilioni 1.3, serikali ya Tanzania inatakiwa kupata asilimia 20 ya kiasi hicho ambayo ni dola milioni 260.	because the sale of shares is worth 1.3 billion dollars, the Tanzanian government is supposed to get 20 percent of the amount which is 260 million dollars.
<10>	Akizungumza na Raia Mwema wiki hii, Naibu Waziri wa Nishati na Madini, George Simbachawene, alisema wanatarajia kupata fedha hizo wakati wowote mauzo hayo yatakapopitishwa.	speaking to Raia Mwema this week, the deputy minister for energy and minerals, George Simbachawene, said they expect to get that money any time when the sale is approved.
<11>	“Inategemea na namna hao wanaouziana hisa watakavyokubaliana lakini sisi tunafahamu tu kwamba wakimalizana, yetu itakuwa asilimia 20.	"it depends on how those trading the shares will agree but we know that when they are done 20 percent will be ours.
<12>	Kwa vyovyote vile, inaonekana mauzo yanaweza kufanyika kwenye robo ya kwanza ya mwaka ujao wa 2014,” alisema Simbachawene.	whatever the case, it is more likely that the sales will take place in the first quarter of next year, 2014," said Simbachawene.
<13>	Ophir ina makao yake makuu katika miji ya London, Uingereza na Perth nchini Australia na kwa mujibu wa tovuti yake, ilianzishwa mwaka 2004.	Ophir has its headquarters in London, England and Perth, Australia and according to its website, it was started in 2004.
<14>	Kampuni ya Pavillion Energy inamilikiwa na serikali ya Singapore.	Pavillion energy is owned by the Singapore government.
<15>	Vitalu ambayo vimeuzwa katika uuzianaji huo vinaelezwa kuwa na ujazo wa mita za ujazo trilioni 15 na mauzo hayo pia yameenda sambamba na uuzaji wa hisa nyingine 17.6 katika makampuni yatakayokuwa yakifanya biashara za gesi hiyo hapa nchini.	the blocks sold during the sales are expressed to have a capacity of 5 trillion and the sales have also been in line with sales of another 17.6% of shares in companies that will be conducting gas businesses here in the country.
<16>	Kwa mujibu wa Simbachawene, makampuni hayo matatu ni Ruvuma Pipeline Company Limited, Mzalendo Gas Processing Company Limited na Fahari Marketing Limited.	according to Simbachawene, the three companies are Ruvuma pipeline limited, Mzalendo gas processing limited and Fahari marketing limited.
<17>	Simbachawene alisema nia ya serikali kwa sasa ni kutaka kutumia fedha hizo kwa ajili ya kulipa madeni na kuliboresha Shirika la Umeme Tanzania (Tanesco), ingawa alisema itategemea pia na mahitaji mengine yatakayokuwepo wakati fedha hizo zitakapopatikana.	Simbachawene said that the current intentions of the government is to use the money for paying debts and to improve the Tanzanian electric company (TANESCO), though he said it will also depend on the other needs available when the money will be available.
<18>	“Hizi ni fedha za Watanzania wote na si za wizara yetu pekee.	"this is money for all Tanzanians and not for our ministry only.
<19>	Tunataka kuliwezesha shirika letu la umeme ili lifanye kazi vizuri na kuboresha upatikanaji wa nishati ya umeme kwa watu wengi zaidi.	we want to enhance our electric company so that it can work well and improve the accessibility of electric energy to many people.
<20>	“Hata hivyo, sisemi kwamba ni hela zote zitatumika kwa kazi hiyo au la lakini kuna mawazo hayo.	"even so, I am not saying that all the money will be used in that work or not but these are the thoughts.
<21>	Mambo mengine serikali itaamua kutokana na wakati fedha hizo zitakapopatikana.	other things the government shall decide when that money will be available.
<22>	Huwezi kujua kutakuwa na nini wakati huo,” alisema Naibu Waziri huyo.	you cannot know what will be there then," said the deputy minister.
<23>	Alisema kwa miaka ya nyuma, Tanzania isingepata kitu kutokana na sheria zilizokuwepo na akasema serikali itajitahidi kuboresha sheria zake ili kuhakikisha inafaidika na utajiri uliokuwepo.	he said in previous years, Tanzania could not have gotten anything as a result of the laws that were in place and said that the government will work hard to improve its laws so that it makes sure it benefits from the wealth that is there.
<24>	Mmoja wa wachambuzi wa masuala ya gesi aliyehojiwa na mtandao wa Bloomberg kuhusiana na uuzaji huu wa hisa, Tony Regan wa kampuni ya Tri Zen Inc alisema uamuzi wa kununua hisa hizo ni wa “roho ngumu” kwa sababu Tanzania ni eneo bichi kwenye sekta ya gesi.	one of the analysts of gas matters, who was interviewed by Bloomberg in relation to this sale of shares, Tony Regan of Tri Zen Inc, said the decision of buying those shares is 'mean' because Tanzania is a raw region in the gas sector.
<25>	“Mpaka sasa hakuna sheria rasmi iliyopitishwa kuhusiana na masuala ya gesi na hivyo Singapore inaingia katika eneo bichi kabisa katika sekta hii.	"until now there was no official law passed associated with gas matters and therefore Singapore is entering into a very raw region in this sector.
<26>	Kumbuka pia kwamba gesi ya kwanza itaanza kuvunwa mwaka 2020 kutoka kwenye vitalu hivyo na utaona kwamba huu ni uamuzi mzito,” alisema.	remember also that the first gas will begin to be harvested in the year 2020 from the blocks and you will see that this is a heavy decision," he said.
