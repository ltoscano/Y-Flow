<1>	(0.000-0.711)	wana mzozo .	they have a dispute .
<2>	(0.711-1.474)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<3>	(1.474-11.807)	<hes> (()) <no-speech> <sta> tumeweza kufuatilia vizuri sana <int> <hes> huu mjadala labda kwa muda mfupi huu kabla hatujapisha kupata dondoo <hes> za magazeti .	(()) we've been able to follow the discussion very well perhaps for this short time before we pave way to the newspapers' highlights .
<4>	(11.807-25.606)	<hes> mpango tunaona upo sasa kwa timu yetu ya soccer <breath> ya Tanzania <hes> taifa Stars na vile vile tumeshaona hata jopo la makocha ambao wako chini kuhakikisha kwamba wanawanoa vizuri hao vijana .	we can see a plan now for our Tanzanian soccer team Taifa Stars and at the same time we have seen a panel of coaches who are on the ground to ensure that they are sharpening those youths well .
<5>	(25.606-29.611)	lakini kitu ambacho mi kimenifurahisha ni kwamba kuwajengea uzalendo .	but the thing that has made me happy is building them patriotism .
<6>	(29.611-30.576)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<7>	(30.576-34.540)	uzalendo katika swala zima la kuandaa wachezaji una umuhimu kwa kiasi gani ?	how much benefit does the whole issue of patriotism in the preparation of players have ?
<8>	(34.540-35.777)	<hes> lina umuhimu .	it has benefits .
<9>	(35.777-41.122)	<int> lina umuhimu kwa sababu unajua <hes> huwezi kuwa unakifanya kitu kwamba labda hukijui <int> kiundani .	it has benefits because you know you can't be doing something that you probably don't know in depth .
<10>	(41.122-45.270)	lakini kama unakifanya kitu na ukifahamu kiundani nina imani utakifanya vizuri .	but if you know something and understand it deeply then I have faith that you will do it properly .
<11>	(45.270-46.745)	hautakifanya kwa kulipua .	you will not do it through explosion .
<12>	(46.745-56.560)	sasa uta- -- uta- -- utapewa ufundi utapewa ujanja utatengenezwa vizuri kisaikolojia lakini kumbe bado hujaelewa kwamba unaenda kuwajibika kwa sababu ipi .	you will be given skills you will be given tricks you will be psychologically prepared but you may not have understood the reason you are going to be responsible .
<13>	(56.560-62.580)	(()) maana hata pale awali nilikwambia kwamba kule (()) <breath> ina maana miongoni mwa vitu ambavyo wanatengenezwa ni pamoja na uzalendo .	(()) because even in the beginning I told you that in (()) has a meaning that among the things they are making are together with patriotism .
<14>	(62.580-66.070)	(()) mshauri wa -- wa -- wa -- wa Rais amelizungumza hilo .	(()) the adviser to the president has spoken about it .
<15>	(66.070-66.558)	unaona ?	do you see ?
<16>	(66.558-73.040)	kwa hiyo uzalendo ina maana ataielewa nchi yake kwamba sasa mimi nakwenda kupigana kwa ajili ya kuitetea nchi yangu .	in that patriotism means he will understand his country that now I'm going to fight for the sake of defending my country .
<17>	(73.040-77.480)	kwamba niko tayari kwa lolote lile ilimradi nilete heshima katika nchi yangu .	that I am ready for anything possible as long as I bring honor to my country .
<18>	(77.480-81.100)	(()) ndiyo kubwa ambalo wameelekezwa vijana walioko kule Rungwe .	(()) is the main thing that has been directed to the youths who are in Rungwe .
<19>	(81.100-82.749)	lakini wengi walikuwa wanakosa uzalendo .	but many of them were lacking patriotism .
<20>	(82.749-87.217)	wengi walikuwa wanacheza tu nakuangalia kwamba mpira ni -- ni -- ni kitu tu cha starehe .	many of them were just playing and looking at football as just something of pleasure .
<21>	(87.217-91.270)	hawakujua kwamba mpira ni kazi kama zilivyo kazi zingine na anatakiwa mtu awajibike .	they didn't know that soccer is a job just like other jobs and a person is required to be dutiful .
<22>	(91.270-96.481)	kwa hiyo nina imani kabisa kwamba huko tunakokwenda <breath> vijana Watanzania wata- -- <hes> wata- -- watakuwa na uzalendo wa nchi yao .	for that I have full trust that where we are going the Tanzanian youths will have patriotism for their country .
<23>	(96.481-98.427)	watakuwa na uzalendo <breath> na kule wanakotoka .	they will be patriotic of where they are coming from .
<24>	(98.427-103.910)	wakishakuwa na uzalendo nina imani kabisa kwamba kuta- -- ku- -- ku- -- ku- -- kutokana na ule ufundi ambao watakuwa wamepewa %incomplete	when they have patriotism I have total faith that from the skills which they would have been given %incomplete
<25>	(103.910-110.600)	kutokana kwamba watakuwa wameshapewa nidhamu ya kimchezo ndani na nje ya uwanja <breath> nina imani kabisa maboresho haya yatakuwa mazuri sana .	from the sports discipline they would have received from inside and outside the pitch I have total faith that these improvements will be very good .
<26>	(110.600-118.091)	na kikubwa zaidi kama nilivyosema pale awali kwamba <breath> kushiriki michuano mingi (()) chini miaka ishirini chini ya miaka kumi na saba chini ya miaka kumi na tano .	and the major thing as I said in the beginning is that participating in many contests (()) under twenty years under seventeen years under fifteen years .
<27>	(118.091-123.374)	hapo tutakuwa na akiba ya vijana wengi sana kwamba leo hii ametoka Kiemba nani anayefuatia ?	we will have a reserve of very many youths and if today one leaves Kiemba who follows up on him ?
<28>	(123.374-125.670)	leo hii ametoka Yondani nani anayefuatia ?	if today he leaves Yondani who follows up on him ?
<29>	(125.670-129.026)	tusiwe tu kwamba kila -- kila mwaka awe Yondani kila mwaka awe Kiemba hapana .	we shouldn't just assume that every year he is in Yondani or every year he is in Kiemba no .
<30>	(129.026-137.440)	au Chuja uhuh sasa hivi ina maana tutakuwa na vijana wengi ambao sasa tutawatoa kwenye under twenty tutawatoa kwenye under fifteen tutawatoa kwenye under -- under -- under eighteen .	or Chuja no for now it means we will have many youths whom we'll remove from under twenty under fifteen and under eighteen .
<31>	(137.440-145.030)	kwa hiyo tukishakuwa na -- na -- na vijana wengi akiba wengi <breath> ina maana sasa tutakuwa na timu nzuri ya taifa ambayo tutajivunia kwa baadaye .	therefore when we have many youths in the reserve then it means we can now have a good national team that we can be proud of in future .
<32>	(145.030-153.050)	<hes> na kuna lile swala la mchezaji anapokuwa kwenye timu ya taifa (()) hachezi kwa kiwango kinachotakiwa tofauti na anapokuwa kwenye kilabu .	and there is another issue of a player while in the national team (()) does not play according to the standards required different from when he is in the club .
<33>	(153.050-156.128)	hilo nalo ni muhimu kufu- -- kufundishwa wachezaji ?	is this important for the players to be trained on ?
<34>	(156.128-157.700)	eh ndiyo hapo tunakuja sasa .	yes we are coming there now .
<35>	(157.700-159.680)	swala -- swala zima la uzalendo .	the issue -- the issue of patriotism .
<36>	(159.680-164.210)	kwa sababu kuna wengine wako vizuri <int> katika kilabu yao lakini hawako vizuri katika timu ya taifa .	because there are some who are very good in their clubs but are not good in the national team .
<37>	(164.210-172.100)	sasa pale (()) inategemeana na -- na -- na masilahi kwamba labda mtu amechukuliwa na kuenda timu ya taifa lakini je ameondoka vipi ?	on that (()) it depends on the needs perhaps someone has been taken into the national team but how has he left ?
<38>	(172.100-172.394)	unaona ?	do you see ?
<39>	(172.394-173.231)	hiyo (()) zamani .	that (()) in the past .
<40>	(173.231-176.318)	timu ya taifa inasafiri kwenda Zambia kwa basi lakini (()) hamna .	the national team is traveling to Zambia by bus but (()) is not there .
<41>	(176.318-178.750)	mtu anafika pale tayari anakuita (()) upo .	someone arrives at that place and already calls (()) there .
<42>	(178.750-179.800)	sasa utakuwa na mawazo gani ?	now what thoughts will you have ?
<43>	(179.800-182.313)	kazi ni kwako tu wewe mwenyewe kuenda kuitumikia timu ya taifa .	the task is just for you to go and work for the national team .
<44>	(182.313-183.650)	mm mm .	mm mm .

<46>	(189.920-197.851)	na kila mwaka huwa mnahudhuria kule <breath> <hes> Uganda umepiga hatua kubwa sana katika swala zima la shule za soccer za <int> sports Academy .	and every year you visit there Uganda has made huge steps in the whole issue of soccer schools of sports academy .
<47>	(197.851-200.950)	<hes> tumezidiwa nini hasa na wale jamaa ?	what exactly have we been overpowered with by those guys ?
<48>	(200.950-202.553)	ukiangalia (()) Tanzania hapa .	if you look at (()) here in Tanzania .
<49>	(202.553-204.632)	ahh <lipsmack> kwanza wale wameanza muda mrefu .	ahh in fact they have started for a long time .
<50>	(204.632-209.080)	wameanza muda mrefu na wakajitambua kwamba soccer linatakiwa lianzie chini .	they have started for a long time and recognized that soccer should begin small .
<51>	(209.080-211.576)	na ndiyo maana kule wao wana Umoja kabisa wa shule za soccer .	and that is the reason they are very much united in soccer schools at home .
<52>	(211.576-214.490)	sasa huku sisi Tanzania tulichelewa .	now delayed here in Tanzania .
<53>	(214.490-216.728)	sisi tulikuwa na shule moja watu wanaizungumzia ile Makonge .	we had one school that people talk of in Makonge .
<54>	(216.728-218.830)	ile Makonge ilikuwa inachukua vijana wa Secondary .	the one in Makonge used to take secondary school boys .
<55>	(218.830-223.346)	eh sio kama vi- -- sio -- sio kama ilivyo sasa hivi labda hii -- hii -- hii shule ya Alliance .	yes it's not like -- it's not -- it's not like the way it is now perhaps the Alliance school .
<56>	(223.346-225.950)	wao wameanzia kuchukua vijana wadogo wa primary .	they have started taking young boys from primary .
<57>	(225.950-229.200)	(()) ina maana huko ndiyo wanakwenda wanatengeneza sasa misingi .	(()) has a meaning that is the place they go to build the foundations now .
<58>	(229.200-233.540)	ina maana kijana leo hii atakayetoka kutoka katika shule ya Alliance kwenda mpaka timu ya taifa .	it means that a boy today can come from the Alliance school and go to the national team .
<59>	(233.540-236.216)	atatoka na misingi yote <no-speech> unaona ?	he will come out with all the foundations do you see that ?
<60>	(236.216-239.251)	kwa sababu pale tuna walimu wataalamu wanafundishwa wale vijana .	because we have expert teachers there so those boys are being trained .
<61>	(239.251-241.221)	bali ya masomo darasani (()) wanafundishwa soccer .	in place of subjects in class (()) they are taught soccer .
<62>	(241.221-243.990)	kwa hivyo mwana tu- -- tungeamka kama ilivyoamka Alliance .	therefore just for that we would have woken up like Alliance woke up .
<63>	(243.990-246.266)	nina imani kabisa kwamba tungekuwa tumeshapiga hatua .	I have total faith that we would have made a step .
<64>	(246.266-248.271)	lakini sasa inatakiwa sasa tufanye nini ?	but what are we required to do now ?
<65>	(248.271-252.990)	tuisupport sasa Alliance zijitokeze shule zingine ambazo zinaanzia katika primary .	we should support Alliance so that other schools that begin from primary can emerge .
<66>	(252.990-253.661)	unaona ?	do you see that ?
<67>	(253.661-256.047)	na kubwa zaidi lazima tutengeneze Umoja wa zile shule .	and the biggest thing is that we must create a union for those schools .
<68>	(256.047-259.340)	tukisha tengeneza ule Umoja nina imani kabisa tutatoka hatua moja kwenda hatua nyingine .	when we create the union I have total faith that we will move from one step to another .
<69>	(259.340-273.600)	kwa sababu ule Umoja utatoka utakwenda kushauri kama (()) mshauri wa ufundi wa Rais ata- -- watatoka wale Umoja watapata na mawazo watakwenda (()) tutatoka tu huku tulipo kwa sababu ukanda huu <hes> bado kwamba wale wameanza Uganda muda mrefu lakini sisi hawatu- -- hawatu- -- hawatuzidi katika vipaji .	because the union that go to advise the likes of (()) the technical adviser to the president will get out and get ideas they will go to (()) and we will get out of where we are because in this region Uganda still started a long time ago but they are not more talented than us .
<70>	(273.600-275.667)	sisi vijana wengi wana vipaji hapa Tanzania .	many of our boys are very talented in Tanzania .
<71>	(275.667-276.269)	unaona ?	do you see that ?
