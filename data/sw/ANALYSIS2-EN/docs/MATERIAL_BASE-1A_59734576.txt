<3>	KLABU ya KCB, hesabu kali za ku tena straika wao mani Paul Mungai anayeuguza jera sasa, kutoka kwa Simba SC wa Wanabenki hao w kichwa, wakijiuliz itakuwa sahihi ku Kiongera kwa m miezi sita katika hiki ambacho a kupata nafuu kuto upasuaji wa jeraha la fanyiwa India mwak “Tumekuwa tukija Simba na wamekub Kiongera kwa mk kipindi cha miezi Hatuna tatizo kum tena KCB ila suala lake ndilo linatucha nafikiri tutahitaji wa daktari.”	the KCB Club is strongly considering putting back their main striker, Paul Mungai, who is nursing an injury for now. from Simba SC, those bankers asked if Kiongera for six months in this when he gets well from the surgery on the injury in India "we have been coming to Simba and they have Kiongera for a period of months. we have no problem again KCB but his issue is the one that I think we need a doctor.
<4>	Me KCB, Joseph Okal “Ikiwa jeraha hilo zaidi ya miezi mita basi itakuwa vigum ikizingatiwa kwam ruhusa ya kuwa miezi sita pekee,” Hata hivyo mchezaj matumaini ya kwam mwezi ujao Februar yupo fiti kabisa kure jani tena kufanya yake.	KCB, Joseph Okal "if the injury is for more months, then it will be hard considering that the permission was for only six months," however, the player's hope is that next month in February he will be totally fit to again to do his thing.
<5>	MKOPO “Natarajiwa nitakuwa kabisa kufikia Februa maana tulikubaliana kwamba niachie na kwa mchezaji mwing geni kwa wakati huo.	"I am expected to be on loan by February because we had agreed that I should let another player at the time.
<6>	Hivyo wameamua kwa mkopo KCB h Julai nitakapokuwa t jea tena kwenye kik Kiongera akajipa m Kiongera alijiunga msimu uliopita akit kwa dau la zaidi ya sh ioni moja na baada y mechi tatu na kupach mawili, alitonesha jer ambalo limekuwa tangu alipokuwa G Jeraha hilo lilimwe miezi miwili kabla ya kuamua kugharamia ya upasuaji wake ku ambayo itamchukua an miezi mingine mitatu kupona.	they have therefore decided on a KCB loan in July, when I will again give to Kiongera. Kiongera joined last season to the boat of more than one shillings and after three and a half matches, he hurt, which had been there since he was in G. he was injured for two months before deciding to pay for surgery, which will take him another three months to heal from.
<7>	Kutokana na hilo, Simba iliamua kumsajili straika mbadala ili kujaza nafasi yake na ndio ilifanikiwa kumpata Dan Sserunkuma katika kipindi hiki ambacho ligti ya Tanzania inazidin kuchachamaa.	as a result of that, Simba decided to sign up an alternative striker to fill his position and then succeeded in getting Dan Sserunkuma during this period where the Tanzanian league is getting hot.
<8>	Ujio wa Sserunkuma ulifikisha idadi ya wachezaji wa kigeni ndani ya Simba kufikia watano na kwa mujibui wa kanuni za Ligi Kuu ya Tanzania, hicho ndicho kiwango cha juu kinachotakiwa kufikiwa na klabu yeyote.	the coming of Sserunkuma made the total number of foreign players inside Simba five and according to the regulations of the Tanzanian Main League, that is the highest standard that is required to be attained by any club.
<9>	Hivyo Simba ikalazimika kumwondoa Kiongera kwenye kikosi chake cha msimu huu lakini itaendelea kumlipa mshahara wake hadi mwishoni mwa msimu ambapo inatarajia atakuwa amepona.	therefore Simba was forced to remove Kiongera from its squad for this season but it will continue to pay him his salary until the end of the season where it expects that he would have recovered.
<10>	Kufikia kipindi hicho, Simba itakuwa ishafahamu wachezaji wa kigeni itakaokuwa ikisitisha mkataba wao ili kumtengenezea nafais tena Kiongera kiurejea kikosni.	by that time, Simba would have known the foreign players whose contracts it will be putting on hold so as to create a position again for Kiongera to return to the squad.
<11>	Ila kabla ya hilo kutokea, Simba imewazia kumtuma kwa mkopo na tayari KCB wameonyesha nia ya kumsajili kwa kipindi hicho cha miezi sita licha ya kuwa wana wasiwasi ikiwa watafaidi huduma zake kwani bado hajawa wa kupona.	except, before that happened, Simba has thought of sending him on loan and KCB has already shown an intention to sign him up for the six months period despite their worry if he will benefit from his services because he has not recovered fully.
