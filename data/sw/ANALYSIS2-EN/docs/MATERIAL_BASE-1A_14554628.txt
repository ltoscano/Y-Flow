<1>	'Julio': Dah! Wachezaji wanavuta bangi balaa	Julio: gosh! players these days smoke marijuana, it's catastrophic!
<2>	Umeshawahi kuusikia wimbo wa mwanamuziki 20 Percent...	have you ever heard the song by 20 percent?
<3>	unaitwa Bange...	it's called marijuana.
<4>	bange...	marijuana...
<5>	bange zimesababisha mi nisote...	marijuana has made me broke...
<6>	bange...	marijuana...
<7>	bange..	marijuana...
<8>	bange nitazisaliti ili nitoke.	I will betray marijuana so that I can get out.
<9>	Msanii huyo aliimba wimbo huo kuelimisha jamii kuwa uvutaji wa bangi sio kitu kizuri kwani zilisabasha mpaka akaenda jela baada ya kumpora mtu.	the artiste sang that song to educate society that smoking of marijuana is not a good thing because they caused him to go to jail because of stealing from someone.
<10>	Sasa Bangi inaonekana kumchukiza kocha mmoja mwenye makeke ya aina yake kwenye Ligi Kuu Bara.	now marijuana seems to vex one coach with a boast of his own in the Mainland Premier League.
<11>	Namzungumzia Jamhuri Kihwelo ‘Julio’, kocha mwenye mbwembwe nyingi na maneno mengi uwanjani kiasi cha kuwavutia mashabiki wengi wa soka ambao huvutiwa na porojo zake.	I am speaking about Jamhuri Kihwelo 'Julio', the coach with a lot of pomp and many words on the field, to the level of attracting many soccer fans who are attracted to his chatter.
<12>	Kocha huyo anapoiongoza timu yake utampenda kutokana na anavyokuwa akihangaika uwanjani lakini baada ya mechi, iwe amefungwa au kashinda hakosi maneno ya kuzungumza na vyombo vya habari.	when this coach leads his team, you will like him because of how he struggles on the field but after the match, whether they have lost or won, he never lacks words to speak to the media.
<13>	Spoti Miki ilifanya mahojiano na kocha huyo na kubwa zaidi ni madai aliyowahi kuyazungumza kuwa wachezaji wa Tanzania wengi wao hawafundishiki kutokana na kuvuta sana bangi na wakiingia uwanjani husahau maelekezo yote na kucheza wanavyojua wao.	Spoti Miki has had interviews with the coach and the major one was about the claims he always makes that most Tanzanian players are not trainable because they smoke too much marijuana and forget all instructions they are given when they get onto the pitch and instead play as they know.
<14>	Swali: Julio wewe ni kocha, kwanini wachezaji hawapigi hatua za mbali hata kumfikia Mbwana Samatta japo robo yake?	question: Julio, you are a coach, why don't the players make long strides reach Mbwana Samatta by just a quarter?
<15>	Julio: Ngoja nikwambie dada’angu, moja ya matatizo ya soka ya Tanzania kushindwa kupiga hatua ni wachezaji wengi kuvuta bangi.	Julio: let me tell you, my sister. one of the soccer problems stopping Tanzania from moving ahead is because many players smoke marijuana.
<16>	Ndio bangi, ile unayoifahamu wewe, wengine wanapenda kuuita mmea, wengine wanaiita ganja na wengine msuba.	yes, marijuana that you know of, some like to call it a plant, others call it ganja and others cats.
<17>	Ni tatizo kwa wachezaji.	it is a problem to the players.
<18>	Swali: Sasa Julio, kuna uhusiano gani hapo wa bangi na mchezaji?	question: now, Julio, what is the relationships between marijuana and a player?
<19>	Julio: Uhusiano upo, mimi nina ufahamu, na ninasema wachezaji wengi wa Tanzania wanavuta bangi jambo linalosababisha wakati mwingine kutoifanya kazi yao ipasavyo uwanjani na kufanya ovyo kutokana na akili zao kupelekeshwa na bangi…yaani wanacheza mpira wa kibangibangi.	Julio: there is a relationship, I understand it and I confess that many Tanzanian players smoke marijuana, something that makes them fail to do their job as required on the pitch at time, and perform poorly as a result of their brains being consumed by marijuana, that is, they play marijuana like soccer.
<20>	Swali: Julio wewe ni kocha, na kocha husimamia nidhamu ya wachezaji, inakuwaje unaachia?	question: Julio, you are a coach, and a coach oversees the discipline of the players. how come you're so lenient?
<21>	Julio: Mimi nasema, acha wachezaji wanione mbaya lakini kuna siku mambo yakifika shingoni, nitawataja tu tena wote ili kukiokoa kizazi cha soka la Tanzania.	Julio: I say, let the players view me as wicked but there is a day when things reach the head and I will just mention all of them so as to save the soccer generation in Tanzania.
<22>	Swali: Kwani umegundua nini hadi unasema wachezaji wanavuta bangi?	question: what have you discovered for you to say that players are smoking marijuana?
<23>	Julio: Mimi ninakwambia, Wallah wachezaji wa Tanzania wanavuta sana bangi na hizo bangi wanazovuta zinasababisha wacheze tu ili mradi uwanjani na kufanya uamuzi wa kushangaza.	Julio: I'll tell you, by God, Tanzanian players smoke a lot of marijuana and the marijuana that they smoke, causes them to just play to stay on the field and make surprising decisions.
<24>	Ujue bangi ikizidi sana, akili nayo inakuwa ovyo, kwani inakua imeshakaa kibangibangi na bangi inaathiri sana akili na kama ya mchezaji, mwisho wa siku anakujikuta anafanya vitu vya ajabu uwanjani.	you should know that when marijuana exceeds the limit, the brain wavers as it becomes clouded by marijuana. marijuana really affects the player's brain and at the end of the day finds himself doing shocking things at the pitch.
<25>	Inafika hatua, sehemu ambayo labda mchezaji kwa akili ya kawaida, anatakiwa kuokoa vizuri mpira, lakini unaweza ukashangaa kabutua au kafanya jambo lolote la kushangaza.	it gets to a point where a usually sane player is supposed to properly defend the ball, but you can be surprised when he may be dumbfounded or does something surprising.
<26>	Haya angalia, unamfundisha mchezaji ukiingia uwanjanim, kafanye hivi na hivi, akiingia uwanjani, unajiuliza hivi kweli ndivyo nilivyomuelekeza afanye hivi?	now look, you can train a player to do this and that when they get to the pitch but you can ask yourself when he enters the pitch, if that is how you directed him to play.
<27>	Hizi ni bangi tu.	this is just marijuana!
<28>	Mchezaji wa Ulaya, tunaona kila siku, wakati anaingia, unaona kocha anamuelekeza hadi njia za kupita, mchezaji anapita mulemule na wanapata goli, wakifungwa bahati mbaya, lakini anafanya kile anachoelezwa, sasa angalia hawa wa kwetu.	daily, we see a European player directed by the coach when he enters the pitch including the routes to go through. that player goes through the same routes and they get a goal, if they lose, it is bad luck, but he does as directed. now look at our own.
<29>	Swali: Unasema utawataja, sasa kwanini usiwataje leo, unasema kuna siku utawataja wakati unawajua, huoni unaendelea kuangamiza kizazi cha wanasoka?	question: you say that there is a day you will mention them while you know them. now why don't you mention them today, don't you think you're continuing to destroy the soccer generation?
<30>	Julio: Mimi sina haraka.	Julio: I'm not in a hurry.
<31>	Kuna siku nitawataja wote nakwambia ili hii tabia ikome, kwa kuwa inaharibu kizazi cha soka la Tanzania…mpira hauwezi kuendelea kwa hali hii, hatuwezi kuwapata akina Samatta wengine kwa kuvuta bangi.	there's a day I will name all of them with the habit to stop, because it is destroying the soccer generation of Tanzania. soccer can't progress in this state, we can't be the likes of Samatta by smoking marijuana.
<32>	Swali: Lakini si wanasema bangi inaongeza spidi ya ubongo kufanya kazi, (kicheko mwandishi) hii ikoje?	question: but they say marijuana speeds up the operations in the brain (laughter by the writer), how is that?
<33>	Julio: Asikudanganye mtu, bangi ni mbaya si unaona wengi wamevurugwa na hii ndio maana timu hazifanyi vizuri kwa sababu wachezaji hawafundishiki kwa hali hii.	Julio: let no one deceive you, marijuana is bad. don't you see how many have gotten confused by it and it's the reason teams are not performing well because players can't be trained in this state.
<34>	Kiukweli tabia ya wachezaji wa kibongo kuvuta bangi italipeleka taifa pabaya kisoka kwani wachezaji wengi ni kama wamerukwa akili na kushindwa kujiongeza uwanjani na sababu kubwa ni bangi.	truthfully, the behavior of smoking marijuana for the Tanzanian players will take the nation to a bad place soccer-wise because it's as if many players have gone crazy and fail to perform on the pitch and the reason is marijuana.
<35>	Sisi kama makocha, tunakaa nao na kuwaambia, lakini hawa ni watu wazima, wanakwenda majumbani kwao, wanapitia hukohuko kununua na akija anakuwa ameshalikoki.	we, as coaches, sit with them and tell them but these are adults, they go to their homes and pass by the very same places to buy it and he's already smoked it when he comes.
<36>	Hii tabia ya wahezaji kuvuta bangi inatupeleka pabaya na ndio maana hata timu yetu ya Taifa haifanyi vizuri kwani wachezaji wengi wanavuta bangi na hivyo kushindwa kujiongeza uwanjani.	this habit of players smoking marijuana is taking us to a bad place and it is the reason our national team is not doing well because many players smoke marijuana and therefore fail to perform on the pitch.
<37>	Nduio maana utaona wachezaji wanafanya mambo ya kijinga, hawaelewi wajibu wao, hawaelewi wakati gani wafanye nini, wanajiamulia tu kutokana na akili zao zinavyowatuma kibangibangi.	it's the reason you will see players doing silly things, they don't understand their roles, they don't understand what they should do at what time and just decide for themselves using their marijuana-filled brains.
<38>	Swali: Sasa kama umeshajua wachezaji ama wa kwako au wa timu nyingine, hatua gani umechukua japo ya mfano?	question: now if you have already known the players in your team or another, what measure have you taken just for example?
<39>	Julio: Mimi sijachukua hatua, ila ikifikia nitawataja tu hadharani, mwenye kuchukia achukie, mimi sijali, lakini nasema wachezaji wote wanaofanya vitendo hivyo waache mara moja kwani vinawaathiri na kupoteza vipaji vyao mapema.	Julio: I have not taken any action, but when the time comes, I will name them publicly. whoever wants to hate me should do so, I don't care, but I do say that all players doing such acts should cease immediately because they are affecting and losing their talents early.
<40>	Samatta angekuwa anavuta bangi tusingemwona TP Mazembe wala Genk ya Ubelgiji.	if Samatta was a marijuana smoker, we'd have never seen him at TP Mazembe nor in Genk of Belgium.
<41>	Hawa wameridhika, wanaona ujanja, kumbe ni ujinga wanaoufanya bila kujitambua, lakini hata ukimwambia, ni mkubwa yule, atakusikiliza tu hapo.	some are satisfied, they see cleverness but, instead, it is foolishness what they are doing without knowledge, but even if you tell him, this is an adult who will just listen to you at the time.
<42>	Mchezaji anaweza akawa ana kipaji kikubwa na anaweza kucheza soka kwa muda mrefu lakini kama ataendekeza kuvuta bangi inaweza kukatisha ndoto yake, kwani inamfanya akili yake kutofikiria ipasavyo na kumsababisha afanye uamuzi ambao baadaye anaujutia.	a player could be very talented and could play soccer for a long time but his dream could be cut short if he picks up smoking marijuana, because it causes his brain not to think accordingly and causes him to make decisions which he will regret later.
<43>	Swali: Nini sasa unawaambia wachezaji wenu maana wewe ni kati ya walimu wenye jukumu la kutengeneza wachezaji?	question: what then are you telling our players, because you are among the teachers with a responsibility of molding players?
<44>	Julio: Mimi ninawaambia waache hii tabia.	Julio: I have told them to stop this habit.
<45>	Kuvuta bangi sio ujanja, huwa inaniumiza sana, sio kitu kizuri kuendekeza bangi.	smoking marijuana is not cleverness, it really hurts, taking up marijuana is not something.
