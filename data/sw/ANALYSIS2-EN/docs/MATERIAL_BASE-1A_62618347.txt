<3>	Matukio ya watu kuvamiwa na majambazi na kuporwa fedha yamekuwa yakiripotiwa kila kukicha.	incidences of people being attacked by criminals and money stolen have been reported whenever it becomes dark.
<4>	Idadi kubwa ya wananchi wamekuwa wakivamiwa na kuporwa fedha.	a large number of citizens have been attacked and had money stolen.
<5>	Katika matukio hayo wapo ambao wameuawa, kujeruhiwa na wengine kupata ulemavu wa maisha.	in those incidents, there are some who have been injured and others being disabled for life.
<6>	Kutokana na kushamiri kwa matukio hayo mwandishi wetu amefanya utafiti wa jinsi ya kujiepusha kuingia katika janga hilo.	because of the spread of these incidents, our reporter has researched ways of avoiding getting into that menace.
<7>	Usitembee na fedha nyingi Unapobeba fedha nyingi unajiweka katika hatari ya kudhurika au hata kuuawa.	do not walk with a lot of money, when you carry a lot of money you are putting yourself at risk of being harmed or murdered.
<8>	Mhalifu anapofika kwako anachotaka ni kupata fedha, hivyo kumchelewesha maana yake ni kuhatarisha maisha.	when the criminal comes to you, what he wants to find is money and delaying him means a risk to your life.
<9>	Wahalifu wanaweza kupewa taarifa za wewe kuwa na fedha nyingi wakati fulani, au kutokana na kiwewe wahalifu wanaweza kukugundua kuwa umebeba kiasi kikubwa cha fedha na kukuvamia.	criminals can be given information about you having a lot of money at certain times or because of fear, the criminals may realize that you are carrying large sums of money and attack you.
<10>	Epuka kubeba fedha nyingi, fanya malipo kwa mafungu kidogokidogo mpaka ukamilishe malipo au ununuzi uliotaka kuufanya.	avoid carrying a lot of money, make payments in small portions till you finish the payment or shopping that you wanted.
<11>	Hakikisha uko salama Uhalifu unaweza kutekelezwa mahali popote, hivyo ni vyema kila wakati kuhakikisha mazingira uliyopo ni salama.	ensure you are safe, crime can be conducted anywhere so it is good to always ensure that the environment you are in is safe.
<12>	Kwa mfano unapohisi kuna mtu anakufuatilia, chukua hatua haraka ya kuondoka mahali hapo na kujisogeza unapoweza kupata msaada.	for example, if you feel that there is a person following you, take the action quickly to leave that place and move to where you can get help.
<13>	Fanya malipo kwa kadi, simu Malipo kwa njia za simu au kadi ni namna mojawapo ya kujikinga kwa sababu wahalifu hawawezi kuwa na muda wa kuchukua fedha iliyopo kwenye simu.	make payments using a card, phone, payments using phones or a card is among the ways of protection because criminals don't have time to take money available in the phone.
<14>	Wahalifu wanahitaji fedha za haraka ambazo haziwezi kuacha alama ya wao kukamatwa, mlolongo wa kutoa au kuhamisha fedha ndiyo usalama wako.	criminals need quick money and cannot leave signs of being arrested in the queue of removing or transferring money is your safety.
<15>	Kuwa makini na watu usiowajua Unaweza kukutana na mtu mgeni anayeonekana kutaka kukuzoea ghafla.	be careful with strangers, you can meet a new person that suddenly wants to be acquainted with you.
<16>	Anawe za kuwa anakufahamu kwa kiasi fulani lakini unapotaka kumjua yeye anakupa hadithi ambazo kila ukijitahidi kuzielewa akili yako inakataa.	he could know you to some extent but when you want to know him, he gives you stories that, whenever you make effort to understand, your mind cannot comprehend.
<17>	Watu hawa ni hatari, wanaweza kuwa ndiyo wezi wenyewe au wamekuja kutafuta uhakika wa taarifa za uhalifu wanaotaka kuutekeleza kwako.	these people are dangerous, they can be thieves themselves or they have come to find out the truth about information needed by thieves.
<18>	Kama unafanya biashara, mtu anayetaka kukuibia anaweza kuja zaidi ya mara moja.	if you are doing business, a person who wants to steal from you can come more than once.
<19>	Huwa ni mwenye wasiwasi na anayependa kuuliza maswali mengi.	they normally act confused and like to ask many questions.
<20>	Epuka kuzungumzia mipango yako Unapokaa na watu iwe kazini, sehemu za starehe au mkusanyiko wa aina yoyote usizungumzie mipango yako hasa ile inayohusiana na fedha.	avoid talking about your plans whenever you are with people, even at work, places of leisure or any gathering, do not speak about your plans especially those involving money.
<21>	Unapozungumza na simu kuhusu mipango ya fedha hakikisha hakuna anayekusikiliza kwani anaweza kutoa taarifa hizo kwa wahalifu nao wakapanga mbinu ya kukupora au kukudhuru.	whenever you are talking through the phone about plans involving money, ensure there is no one listening who can give such information to the criminals and allow them to plan ways of robbing or harming you.
<22>	Kuwa makini unapotumia mashine za ATM Usimwamini mtu hasa unapoingia katika mashine za kutolea fedha.	be careful when using ATM machines, do not trust a person especially when entering in the ATM machines.
<23>	Angalia watu waliotangulia au waliopo karibu na eneo la mashine hiyo.	watch out for people who came before or who are near the area of that machine.
<24>	Baada ya kutoa fedha kuwa makini.	be careful after withdrawing money.
<25>	Ukimuona mtu unayemtilia shaka, badilisha uelekeo.	change directions if you see a person you suspect.
<26>	Kama yupo nyuma au mbele yako, vuka upande wa pili wa barabara na ondoka haraka.	cross the road to the other side and quickly leave if he is behind or in front of you.
<27>	Vibanda vya miamala ya fedha Wafanyabiashara wa miamala ya fedha ni waathirika wa uporaji kwa kuwa wanaaminika kuwa na fedha wakati wote.	money agents stalls, businesspeople of money agents are affected by robbery because they are believed to have money all the time.
<28>	Mbinu ya kuepuka kuporwa ni kufunga mapema maduka au vibanda vyao.	the method of avoiding being robbed is to close the shops or stalls early.
<29>	Njia nyingine ni kuwa makini na watu wanaofika kuulizia kama wana kiasi fulani cha fedha wakijifanya wanataka kutoa lakini huondoka bila kufanya hivyo.	another way is to be careful with people who arrive to ask if there is a certain amount of money, pretending that they want to remove that much but leaves without doing that.
<30>	Hawa ni wahalifu ambao hujihakikishia kwanza kama mlengwa ana fedha za kutosha kabla hawajamvamia kwa hiyo, anapotokea mtu kama huyu ni vyema kumfuatilia na ikibidi kufunga kibanda kabla hajarudi na wenzake kufanya uhalifu.	these are criminals who first make sure that the targeted has enough money before attacking him for it, when such a person appears, it is advisable to monitor him and if you must, close the stall before he comes back with his colleagues to do crime.
<31>	Kadhalika, ikiwa umekusanya kiwango kikubwa cha fedha, hakikisha unazihamisha na kubaki na kiasi ambacho kitahitajika kwa miamala katika muda wa kazi uliobaki.	likewise, if you have collected a large sum of money, ensure you transfer it and only keep with the amount that is required in the money agent for the remaining working hours.
