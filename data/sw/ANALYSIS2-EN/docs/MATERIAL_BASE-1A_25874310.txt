<1>	Kamari, dawa za kulevya na mengine	gambling, narcotic drugs and others
<2>	Nov 01, 2012	November 1st, 2012.
<3>	KATIKA dunia ya michezo kwa sasa, kitabu kinachosomwa sana na kinachosisimsha na kutisha ni kile cha The Secret Race kilichoandikw na Tyler Hamilton.	currently in the sports world, the book that is being widely read and which appeals and horrifies is that of "The Secret Race" written by Tyler Hamilton.
<4>	Mshindi huyo wa medali ya dhahabu katika mashindano ya Olimpiki ya mwaka 2004 kwa mbio za baiskeli, ametoa kitabu hicho Septemba mwaka huu na sasa ndiyo watu wanaanza kupata picha halisi ya nini kinaendelea katika sekta ya michezo hapa ulimwenguni.	the gold medal winner in the 2004 Olympic games in a bike race produced the book in September this year and now people are starting to get a real picture of what is going on in the sports sector in the world.
<5>	Kitabu hiki kimetoka katika kipindi ambacho kashfa ya matumizi ya dawa za kuongeza nguvu kwa bingwa wa mbio za baiskeli za Tour de France, Lance Armstrong, ikiwa ndiyo ajenda.	this book was produced during the scandalous period when the use of drugs to increase the strength of Tour de France cycling champion, Lance Armstrong, was the agenda.
<6>	Hamilton alikuwa mtu wa karibu na Armstrong.	Hamilton was a close person to Armstrong.
<7>	Na kwa ushahidi unaopatikana katika kitabu hicho, hakuna namna ambayo Lance anaweza kukana kutumia madawa hayo.	and from the evidence found in the book, there is no way Lance can deny using those drugs.
<8>	The Secret Race kinaeleza ni kwa vipi wachezaji maarufu wanavyoweza kuepuka kugunduliwa na vipimo vya utambuzi wa matumizi ya dawa hizo.	"The Secret Race" describes how great players can avoid detection and diagnosis tests for the use of these drugs.
<9>	Namna wanavyopata madawa hayo na mbinu za kuyasafirisha.	how they get those drugs and the modes of transport.
<10>	Armstrong hakuwa mtu wa kawaida.	Armstrong was extraordinary person.
<11>	Huyu ndiye bingwa wa kihistoria zaidi wa michuano ya baiskeli.	he is the most famous champion of the cycling championship.
<12>	Ameshinda michuano ya Tour de France karibu mara nane.	he has won the Tour de France championship almost eight times.
<13>	Katika jamii ya Kimarekani, huyu alikuwa shujaa.	in American society, he was a hero.
<14>	Lakini kitabu hiki cha Hamilton na majibu ya Taasisi ya Kuzuia Dawa Zilizokatazwa Marekani (USADA), kimeweka bayana kuwa ushindi wote ule ulikuwa feki.	but in Hamilton's book and from the response of the Institute of Preventive Medicine prohibited in United States (USADA), it has clearly set that the victory was a fake.
<15>	Mbaya zaidi, ukweli umezidi kugundulika kuwa zaidi ya nusu ya washindi wote wa Tour de France kati ya mwaka 1980 hadi 1995, walikuwa wanatumia dawa zilizokatazwa.	worst of all, the reality has continuously been discovered that more than half of all the winners of the Tour de France between 1980 to 1995 were using prohibited drugs.
<16>	Ukisoma taarifa za USADA, kitabu hiki na machapisho mbalimbali katika magazeti ya Ulaya na Marekani, kwa kweli unapata kitisho.	if you read the USADA report, this book and other numerous publications in newspapers in Europe and America, you will truly get a shock.
<17>	Na kwa sababu dunia imekuwa ni kama kijiji hivi sasa, ni muhimu kuangalia ni namna gani tunaweza kufanya kuzuia kupata wanamichezo wanaotwaa medali kwa njia zisizo za udanganyifu.	and right now, since the world has become like a village, it is important to look at how we can prevent athletes from winning medals in deceptive ways.
<18>	Ni heri kushindwa kwa heshima kuliko kushinda kwa hila, ghilba na ulaghai.	it is better to fail with honor than win by sham, deceit and fraud.
<19>	Medali zote ambazo Armstrong alishinda katika michuano mbalimbali sasa amevuliwa na heshima yake sasa imeshuka na anaaibika.	all medals that Armstrong won in various championships have now been withdrawn and his respect reduced and embarrassed.
<20>	Wengi wa wanamichezo hawa walifanya hivi kwa kusaidiwa na madaktari.	most of these athletes have done so with the help of doctors.
<21>	Wanamichezo hawa hawakuwa na uelewa mkubwa kuhusu nini madawa haya yanaweza kufanya kwenye miili yao hadi walipokutana na madaktari.	these athletes do not have a greater understanding on what these drugs can do to their bodies until they met with doctors.
<22>	Kwa Marekani, kuna mtu anaitwa Dk. Michel Ferri, wenyewe wakimwita ‘Dr Death,’ huyu ndiye kinara wa kuwaelekeza wachezaji nini cha kufanya ili wasigundulike kuwa wanatumia dawa zilizokatazwa.	in the US, there is someone called Doctor Michel Ferri, whom they call 'Doctor Death', who is the captain that instruct players on what to do to avoid discovery when using prohibited drugs.
<23>	Tishio liko hapa zaidi.	there is more threat here.
<24>	Hii ni kwa sababu, kwa mara ya kwanza katika historia ya Tanzania, wataalamu wanaanza kuingia katika sekta ya michezo.	this is because, for the first time in the history of Tanzania, experts have entered the games sector.
<25>	Timu zote kubwa zina madaktari waliofuzu kitaaluma.	all great teams have qualified medical professionals.
<26>	Tatizo la upungufu wa ajira limefanya wataalamu kusaka ajira popote inapoweza kupatikana.	shortage of labor has caused experts to seek employment anywhere it can be found.
<27>	Michezo imefaidi kwa kuwa na wataalamu wengi zaidi lakini hapa pia ndipo linapoingia tatizo.	sports have benefited by having more professionals, but this is also where the problem starts.
<28>	Kama kusipokuwa na udhibiti, wataalamu hawa watatutengenezea akina Armostrong wengine.	if there is no control, these professionals will provide us with more people like Armstrong.
<29>	Na kwa nchi kama ya kwetu ambapo mambo mengi yanakwenda shaghalabaghala, watu watatumia madawa haya hadi kuwa vichaa.	and for a country such as ours where so many things are moving in confusion, people will use these drugs until they go mad.
<30>	Hakuna elimu yoyote inayotolewa kwa wanamichezo au vijana walio shuleni kuhusu umuhimu wa kushinda kwa haki au ubaya wa matumizi ya dawa zilizokatazwa.	there is no education offered to athletes or young people who are in school about the importance of winning fairly or wrongly through use of prohibited drugs.
