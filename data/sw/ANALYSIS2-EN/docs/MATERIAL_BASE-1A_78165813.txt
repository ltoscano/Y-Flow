<1>	KUTANA NA GARI LISILOTUMIA MAFUTA KWA ZAIDI YA MIAKA 100,LINADUMU ZAIDI YA MAISHA YA MTUMIAJI WAKE	meet a vehicle that does not use fuel for more than 100 years, it lasts longer than the life of its user.

<3>	Moja kati ya mambo ambayo mtu wa anayafikiria kabla hajanunua gari ni kiasi cha mafuta kinachotumiwa na gari hilo.	one of the things that a person thinks of before buying a car is the amount of fuel the car consumes.
<4>	Lakini ukiwa na gari hili… unaweza usifikirie kabisa kuhusu mafuta huku ukilitumia kama kawaida kwa zaidi ya miaka 100.	but if you have this vehicle, you can stop thinking about fuel at all while using it as normal for more than 100 years.
<5>	Wataalam wa masuala ya magari wameeleza kuwa endapo gari linalotumia ‘Thorium’ litaanza kufanya kazi litakuwa gari ambalo linaweza kutumika kwa zaidi ya miaka 100 bila kuongezwa mafuta.	the experts in vehicles have explained that if this vehicle which uses Thorium starts working, it will be a vehicle that can be used for more than 100 years without adding fuel.
<6>	Kwa maana hiyo Thorium itakuwa na uwezo wa kudumu hata zaidi ya maisha ya mtumiaji wa gari hilo.	for that reason, Thorium will have a long lasting ability, even more than the life of the vehicle user.
<7>	Kampuni ya Laser Power tayari imeshatengeneza idea ya kutumia Thorium katika engine za magari ambapo wataitumia kitaalam kuchemsha maji na kuwa chanzo cha nguvu ya kuendesha gari.	the Laser Power Company has already developed an idea to use Thorium in car engines where they will use it to boil water and become the source of energy for driving the car.
<8>	Hata hivyo, CEO wa Laser Power System, Dr.	however, the CEO of Laser Power System Doctor
<9>	Charles Sevens aliiambia Mashable kuwa engine za Thorium hazitaweza kuwa kwenye magari hivi karibu kwa kuwa watengenezaji wa magari hawataki kuzinunua.	Charles Sevens told Mashable that the Thorium engines will not be in vehicles soon because car manufacturers do not want to buy them.
<10>	Cars are not our primary interest.	"cars are not our primary interest.
<11>	The automakers don’t want to buy them.	the automakers don't want to buy them.
<12>	Alisema Dr Charles Stevens.	said Doctor Charles Stevens.
<13>	Alisema makampuni mengi ya magari yanataka kutengeneza pesa zaidi kwa kutumia engines za gas na kwamba itawachukua miongo kadhaa kukubali na kuanza kutmia teknolojia ya Thorium.	he said that many car companies want to make more money by using gas engines and that it will take several decades for them to agree to start using the Thorium technology.
<14>	Endapo gari hili litafanikiwa kuingia sokoni na kununuliwa na watu wengi miaka ijayo, itakuwa hatari kwa biashara ya mafuta hasa kwa wale wanaotegemea magari pekee kufanya mauzo.	if this car succeeds in getting into the market and is bought by many people in the coming years, it will be dangerous to the fuel business especially to those who depend on cars alone to make sales.
