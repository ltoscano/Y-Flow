<5>	Timu hiyo iliwasili majira ya saa 5:20 za asubuhi katika bandari ya Malindi Zanzibar, ambapo waziri huyo aliwataka wachezaji hao wasijisikie vibaya kutokana na kutofanya vyema katika michuano hiyo.	at around 5:20 in the morning, the team arrived at the Malindi port, Zanzibar, where the minister urged the players not to feel disappointed for their poor performance in the tournament.
<6>	Aidha, alisema kwamba kufungwa kwao katika michuano hiyo ni njia mojawapo ya kuweza kujiandaa kwa ajili ya mashindano yajayo.	he said that their loss at the tournament was one way to prepare for the upcoming tournaments.
<7>	“Vijana wangu msiwe na wasiwasi na yaliyotokea mjisikie faraja, kwani mwisho wa mashindano hayo ni kujiandaa na kujipanga kwa mashindano yajayo,”alisema.	"my youths, do not worry about what happened; be comforted, since the end of the tournament means preparing and organizing for future tournaments," he said.
<8>	Hata hivyo, alisema kuwa kuna msemo unasema kwamba akubwagae amekufunza mbinu za kupigana na kusema kuwa hiyo ni moja ya changamoto na watakuwa wamejifunza kitu.	"all the same," he said, "there is a saying that says he who takes you down teaches you fighting skills, and said that is one of the challenges and they will have learned something."
<9>	Sambamba na hilo aliwataka wananchi kujenga utamaduni wa kuzipongeza timu zilizofanya vibaya badala ya kuzipongeza zile tu zilizofanya vizuri.	 he also urged citizens to build a culture of congratulating teams that have performed dismally, instead of only congratulating those that have excelled.
