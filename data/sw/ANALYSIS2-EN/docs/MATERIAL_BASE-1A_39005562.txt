<2>	(1.281-9.510)	<sta> basi kwa mafupi tunarudi kwenye Mada yetu ya pili iliyochangamka kama imemwagiwa malimau inasema hivi <sta> wajaa wazito wanaotumikia kifungo wapewe mahitaji yao ya uzazi ?	well in short we are coming back on our second topic that is exciting as though lemon was poured on it it says this pregnant people serving jail terms be granted their parental needs ?
<3>	(9.510-10.288)	<sta> wapewe .	they be given .
<4>	(10.288-11.493)	e ndiyo -- ndiyo sasa .	come again yes -- yes now .
<5>	(11.493-11.959)	e heh .	pardon yes .
<6>	(11.959-33.971)	tovuti rasmi ya haki za binadamu <sta> imesema -- ambayo iliorodhesha magereza mia moja ishirini na mbili yenye wafungwa elfu arobaini na tatu wa kiume ndani yake kukiwa na wafungwa wa kike <sta> elfu moja mia tatu na sitini na moja pamoja na ripoti ya haki za binadamu ambayo inasema <sta> wafungwa wa jinsia ya kike wananyanyasika sana wananyanyaswa na wafungwa wenzao wa kiume <sta> pamoja na viongozi wao .	official human rights website has said -- which listed one hundred and twenty-two prisons with forty-three thousand male inmates in it having one thousand three hundred and sixty-one women prisoners together with human rights' report that says that inmates of female gender are very oppressed they are being oppressed by both their fellow male prisoners and their leaders .
<7>	(33.971-36.264)	sasa tuna mtazamo gani juu ya swala hili ?	now what view do we have over this matter ?
<8>	(36.264-36.714)	dada .	sister .
<9>	(36.714-37.801)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<10>	(37.801-49.633)	mimi haki zao lazima wapewe (()) <sta> anapoumwa apate matibabu vizuri anatakiwa alale sehemu nzuri ambayo inastahili kwa mwanadamu alale <sta> bila kujali kwamba yeye ni mfungwa .	me their rights must be granted to them (()) when she is in pain she should get a good treatment she is required to sleep in a good place which is fit for human being to sleep without considering that she is an inmate .
<11>	(49.633-53.950)	kwani sasa hivi hawapewi hiyo hadhi ambayo tunasema apewe kama hawapewi ?	because now they are not being given that honor which we are saying she be given if they are not being given ?
<12>	(53.950-58.418)	<sta> <hes> inawezekana kwamba wanapata lakini sio ile inayohitajika kama vile (()) uraiani .	it can be possible that they are getting but not as required like those (()) citizenship .
<13>	(58.418-64.586)	sasa wangapi ambao wam- -- mtu <sta> kuna mtu hapa ambaye amewahi kumtembelea mfungwa labda ndugu yake au rafiki yake ?	now how many who are -- a person is there a person here who have visited an inmate maybe his sibling or his friend ?
<14>	(64.586-66.430)	mimi nishawahi kumtembelea mfungwa .	me I have visited a prisoner .
<15>	(66.430-67.459)	<sta> wa kike wa kiume ?	male or female ?
<16>	(67.459-68.406)	wa kiume .	male .
<17>	(68.406-69.807)	ukakuta hali ikoje ?	how did you find the situation ?
<18>	(69.807-71.690)	nimekuta mazingira sio mazuri kiukweli .	I found the environments were not good honestly .
<19>	(71.690-79.277)	<sta> kwa hiyo hata kama akina mama wajaa wazito ni vyema zaidi kwamba wakathaminiwa zaidi kutokana kwamba wao hawako pekee yao <sta> washakuwa na matatizo .	therefore even like pregnant mothers it's very essential that they are valued more because they are not alone they are already have problems .
<20>	(79.277-87.699)	ina maana wakikosa zile haki zao za msingi watazidi kudhoofika na hata baadaye kuelekea kupata matatizo makubwa <sta> kwenye hali ya uzazi wao .	meaning that if they lack those basic rights they will deteriorate and even later continue to get bigger problems in their fertility status .
<21>	(87.699-94.950)	halafu yule ni binadamu kwa sababu kule kumfunga mtu mbali na adhabu ni kwamba unaenda umrekebishe tabia kwamba akitoka huko uje ukuwe mwananchi bora .	then she is human being because jailing a person a part from being a punishment it's that you are going to correct her behavior that when she comes out she becomes a good citizen .
<22>	(94.950-102.080)	<sta> sasa unafikiri kwa -- kwa hali ambayo unazidi kumweka gerezani kwa taabu zile akitoka huko atakuwa na tabia nzuri au unazidi kumwongezea tena ?	now do you think on -- on the situation that you are continuing to put her in the prison on those sufferings when she comes out she will have good behavior or you are increasing to add her again ?
<23>	(102.080-103.292)	<sta> anazidi kuwa mtu mbaya zaidi yaani .	you mean she is increasing to be a very bad person .
<24>	(103.292-104.353)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<25>	(104.353-113.710)	mnaagree lazima aboreshwe kwanza <sta> kwamba wa- -- gereza lichukue idadi ya watu ambao wanatakiwa waingie mle kama ni mia tano ni mia tano tu ili hata wewe uweze kuwamiliki vizuri wale wafungwa wako .	you agree that her standards must be improved firstly that -- prisons to take its required capacity of people if it's five hundred it's just five hundred so that even you can be able to control those your inmates well .
<26>	(113.710-117.750)	<sta> kwa sababu gereza ya watu mia mbili ukishaweka watu mia tano utacontrol vipi watu hao ?	because a prison for two hundred people if you put five hundred people how will you control those people ?
<27>	(117.750-120.960)	<sta> <overlap> ushawahi kwenda katika gereza la wanawake ?	have you ever gone to a women's prison ?

<29>	(122.440-123.173)	tunaongelea la wanawake .	let's talk about women's .
<30>	(123.173-128.360)	<overlap> lakini kwa sababu (()) kielezi imekuja hivi haya mambo yako kweli kwa sababu jambo haliji hivi hivi .	but because (()) the indication has come that these things are really there because things don't just come up like this .
<31>	(128.360-132.243)	<sta> leo usiangalie pale penye umefika mpaka umebaini ni kweli hali halisi ilivyo yaani umeona ?	today don't look at where you have reached until you have realized that it's a really genuine situation that is there that is you have seen ?
<32>	(132.243-140.001)	sasa waki- -- <int> waki- -- waki- -- wakipewa <sta> mahitaji mazuri kila kitu vizuri huni watakuwa wanafanya makosa makusudi -- makusudi ?	now -- if they are given better needs and everything good criminals will not be doing wrong intentionally -- intentionally ?
<33>	(140.001-142.090)	binadamu wote wanahitaji Uhuru ndugu yangu .	all human beings need freedom my brother .
<34>	(142.090-142.360)	<sta> e .	pardon .
<35>	(142.360-146.706)	usiende gerezani tu chumbani kwako wewe ukiambiwa sasa -- sasa hivi Maasai kaa tu chumbani kwako tu humo ndani .	don't just go to prison inside your room when you are told now -- now this way Maasai just sit there inside your room .
<36>	(146.706-151.090)	una mke wako una watoto wako kila kitu unakula kwa sababu hutoki itakuwa ni kero kwako .	you have your wife and children you eat anything because you don't come out it will be annoying to you .
