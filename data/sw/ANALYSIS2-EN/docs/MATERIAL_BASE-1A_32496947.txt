<4>	BODI ya Wakurugenzi ya Shirika la Ndege la Tanzania (ATCL) imeeleza kuongezeka kwa makusanyo ya shirika hilo katika kipindi kifupi cha uendeshaji wake kutokana na kudhibitiwa kwa mapato na matumizi.	the board of directors of the Tanzanian Airways Company (ATCL) has explained the increase in the company's revenue within a short time of its operation as a result of controlling revenue and expenses.
<5>	Aidha bodi hiyo imeagiza kuwaondoa wakurugenzi watano na baadhi ya mameneja katika nafasi zao kwa kuwa wengi wao wana viwango vya chini vya elimu visivyokidhi matakwa ya nafasi zao hivyo kusababisha utendaji wa kazi kuwa dhaifu.	moreover, the board has promised to remove five directors and some managers from their positions because most of them have low academic qualifications that do not satisfy the demands of their positions, therefore leading to poor performance at work.
<6>	Kutokana na hatua hiyo, bodi hiyo imemuagiza Ofisa Mtendaji Mkuu kutangaza nafasi zote za wakurugenzi na mameneja zilizo wazi na zile zenye wafanyakazi wenye utendaji dhaifu kwa kuzingatia muundo wa muda uliopitishwa na bodi hiyo.	as a result of that step, the board has directed the Chief Executive Officer to announce all vacant managerial and directors positions that are available and those with poorly performing workers with respect to the timeframe passed by the board.
<7>	Hayo yalisemwa na Mwenyekiti wa bodi hiyo ya ATCL, Emmanuel Korosso alipokuwa anazungumzia masuala yanayoihusu kampuni hiyo.	this was announced by the chairman of the ATCL board Emmanuel Korosso when he was speaking about issues concerning the company.
<8>	Akizungumzia kuimarika kwa makusanyo, Korosso alisema; Katika kipindi kifupi tangu kuanza kwa safari za ndege mpya tumeweza kudhibiti mapato na matumizi na kumekuwa na ongezeko la mapato ya uzito wa ziada wa mizigo.	speaking about revenue growth, Korosso said, "in the short period since the beginning of operations of the new planes, we have managed to control income and expenditure and there has been an increase in income from increased cargo tonnage.
<9>	Kuhusu kuondolewa kwa wakurugenzi na mameneja, Mwenyekiti huyo wa bodi alisema bodi hiyo imeagiza kuwa wakurugenzi na mameneja waliokuwa wamethibitishwa kazini lakini hawana sifa kuondolewa katika nafasi zao na kupangiwa majukumu mengine kulingana na sifa zao.	concerning the removal of directors and managers, the board chairman said the board has instructed that the directors and managers that had been vetted at work but have no qualification be removed from their positions and reassigned other responsibilities according to their qualifications.
<10>	Mwenyekiti huyo wa bodi alisema muundo wa muda unataka uwepo wa wakurugenzi watatu tu katika uendeshaji wa kampuni hiyo.	the board chairman said there needs to be a temporary three-directors-only system in the management of the company.
<11>	Akizungumzia baadhi ya maboresho, Korroso alisema katika matumizi ya tiketi za bure au zilizopunguzwa bei, bodi imeagiza Menejimenti ya ATCL kusimamisha kwa muda Mkataba wa Hiari baina ya Menejimenti na wafanyakazi na sasa watapewa tiketi za bure na tiketi yenye punguzo mara moja kwa mwaka kama stahili ya likizo.	speaking about some of the improvements, Korosso said through the use of free or subsidized tickets, the board has directed the ATCL management to temporarily halt the memorandum of understanding between management and employees and they will now be given free and subsidized tickets once a year as their leave allowance.
<12>	Kuhusu idadi ya wafanyakazi Korosso alisema hivi sasa shirika hilo linao wafanyakazi 221 na wanalenga wakiwa na ndege zao zote watakuwa na wafanyakazi 350.	concerning the number of employees, Korosso said right now the company has 221 employees and once they have all their planes, their target is 350 employees.
<13>	Alisema baada ya kupokea ndege mpya mbili aina ya Bombardier Q400 na kuanza safari Oktoba 14 mwaka huu katika kumekuwepo na changamoto ya ucheleweshaji wa ndege na pia kutokutoa huduma kwa maeneo yaliyopaswa kufikiwa.	he said that after receiving the delivery of two brand new Bombardier Q400 aircrafts and commencing operations on October 14th this year, there have been challenges with plane delays as well, as they have not had service in places that were supposed to be served.
