<3>	IKIWA imepita miezi miwili tangu kumalizika kwa mzunguko wa kwanza wa Ligi Kuu ya Vodacom na baadaye TFF kuamuru kufungiwa kwa uwanja wa Kumbukumbu ya Sokoine Jijini Mbeya kutokana na kutokidhi vigezo,Wadau wa mchezo huo wamewatalekezea watoto wadogo wenye umri wa chini ya miaka 18 kuutengeneza uwanja huo.	it's been two months since the end of the first round of the Vodacom Premier league and after TFF ordered the closure of Sokoine memorial stadium in the city of Mbeya as a result of it not meeting the standards, stakeholders of the sport have exploited young children aged below 18 to fix the stadium.
<4>	Mwandishi wa habari hizi aliyetembelea uwanjani hapo alishuhudia kundi la watoto wadogo wenye umri kati ya miaka 12 na 16 kutoka maeneo mbalimbali ya Jiji la Mbeya wakipanda nyasi uwanjani bila malipo yoyote.	the writer of this story, who visited the stadium, witnessed a group of young children, aged between 12 to 16 from various parts of the city of Mbeya, planting grass on the field without any payment.
<5>	Baadhi ya watoto hao ambao walizungumza na waandishi wa habari walidai kuwa wanafanya kazi hiyo ya kupanda nyasi mchana kutwa lakini hakuna malipo yoyote ambapo pia wanadai kuwa wanashinda na njaa wakati wakitekeleza kazi hiyo.	some of those children who spoke to journalists claimed that they are working on planting grass during the day, but there is not a single payment, and they also claim they spend the day without food as they carry out the work.
<6>	Kutokana na hali hiyo Chama cha Mpira wa Miguu mkoa wa Mbeya (MREFA) kimewaomba wadau wa mchezo huo mkoa wa Mbeya kujitolea kwa hali na mali kufanikisha zoezi la ukamilishaji wa uwanja huo ambao ni miongoni mwa viwanja Nane vilivyofungiwa kutokana na kutokokidhi viwango.	as a result of this situation, Mbeya Regional Football Association (MREFA) has asked Mbeya stakeholders of the sport for volunteers of all conditions in order to achieve the completion of the stadium, which is among eight stadiums that were closed as a result of not meeting standards.
<7>	Mwenyekiti wa MREFA mkoa wa Mbeya Elias Mwanjala alisema kuwa tatizo la ukata la chama hicho limesababisha kuomba msaada kutoka kwa wadau mbalimbali wa soka ili kuokoa jahazi na kwamba zoezi la upandaji wa nyasi katika uwanja huo linasuasua kutokana na kukosekana kwa fedha.	the chairman of MREFA Mbeya, Elias Mwanjala, said that the problem of the association's controversy has caused them to seek help from various soccer stakeholders in order to save the situation and that the exercise of planting grass in the stadium has been shut down due to a  lack of funds.
<8>	Hata hivyo Mwanjala alisema kuwa chama hicho kinaendelea kufanya juhudi kwa kushirikiana na timu zinazotumia uwanja huo za Mbeya City na Tanzania Prison kwa kuwaomba mashabiki wa timu hizo kujitokeza kusaidia kupanda nyasi katika uwanja huo.	even so, Mwanjala said that the association is continuing to put effort into cooperating with teams which use the stadium of Mbeya City and Tanzania prison by asking fans of the teams to come out and help by planting grass in the stadium.
<9>	Alisema kuwa tangu kuanza kwa utengenezaji wa uwanja huo wamepata msaada kutoka Jeshi la Magereza na Jeshi la Wananchi (JWTZ) ambao walijitolea gari kwa ajili ya kusomba nyasi na kuzifikisha uwanjani.	he said that since they began fixing the stadium, they have received help from prison forces and the people's Army (JWTZ) who donated a vehicle for transporting grass and delivering it to the stadium.
<10>	Aidha Mwanjala alisema kuwa pamoja na mashabiki kujitokeza kupanda nyasi hizo chama chake kimekosa fedha za kuwasaidia angalau chakula wakati wakiendelea na kazi za upandaji wa nyasi hizo Katika hali isiyo ya kawaida Mwanabloga Wetu alishuhudia makundi ya watoto wadogo wenye umri kati ya miaka 12, 14 wakishiriki upandaji wa nyasi katika uwanja huo ambapo baadhi yao bila kujitaja majina walidai kuwa pamoja na kazi kubwa wanayoifanya kutwa nzima wanashinda na njaa na kwamba hawalipwi chochote.	furthermore, Mwanjala said that as well as the fans having to come to plant the grass, his association also lacks money to help them even by supplying food as they continue the work of planting the grass, an abnormal condition. our blogger witnessed groups of young children of between the ages of 12, 14 taking part in planting grass in the stadium, and some, without mentioning their names, claimed that as well as doing this big job all day they have no food and they aren't paid anything.
<11>	Mapema Blogu hii iliweka picha mbalimbali za Uwanja wa Sokoine kabla haujafungiwa ulioonesha baadhi ya vitega uchumi vya uwanja huo na umati wa mashabiki wanaoingia katika uwanja huo.	earlier, this blog posted various pictures of Sokoine stadium before it was closed, which showed some of the economic activities of the stadium and the number of fans who enter the stadium.
<12>	Baadhi ya wakazi wa Jiji la Mbeya wamedai kuwa mara baada ya uwanja huo kukamilika uwekwe mkakati mbadala wa kudhibiti mapato yanayoingia wakati mchezo wa Ligi kuu kwa madai kuwa fedha zinazoingia hazilingani na hali ya uwanja huo.	a section of Mbeya City residents has claimed that immediately after the stadium was completed, it was put under an alternative plan to control the incoming revenue from league matches, based on the claim that the money earned doesn't compare to the state of the stadium.
<13>	''Mapato ya uwanja huo kuanzia sasa yadhibitiwe, inawezekana fedha zinazoingia zinapitia katika mifuko ya watu na hii ndio sababu umeona uwanja huu uko miaka mingi lakini mapato yake hayajulikani yalipo.	the earnings of the stadium are to be controlled from now on. there is a likelihood that incoming money passes through people's pockets and this is the reason you see that this stadium is old, but no one knows where its earnings are.
<14>	Meneja wa Uwanja huo Modestus Mwaruka hakuweza kupatikana kuelezea lolote juu ya mapato ya uwanja huo kutokana na simu yake kutopatikana kwa muda wote, hata hivyo jitihada za kumpata ili aelezee mustakabali wa uwanja huo ambao unamilikiwa na Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) zinaendelea.	the manager of the stadium, Modestus Mwaruka, couldn't be reached to explain anything about the earnings of the stadium, due to his phone being unreachable for the whole time. even so, efforts to get him to explain the future of the stadium, which is owned by the party of the revolution (CCM), continue.
