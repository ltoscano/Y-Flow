<1>	(0.000-11.500)	<misc> <breath> ni kweli tukiangalia kwa asilimia kubwa ya Watanzania tunashabikia sana timu za ulaya zaidi ya ligi yetu ya Tanzania nami mi nakubali .	it is true that if we check a high percentage of Tanzanians support European teams a lot more that our Tanzanian team and I agree .
<2>	(11.500-22.010)	<breath> lakini kuna sababu ambazo zinatufanya sisi Watanzania tushabikie ligi za Uingereza ligi za Uhispania ligi za Ufaransa <breath> tukaiacha ligi yetu ya Kibongo .	but there are reasons making us Tanzanians to support European Hispanic and French leagues leaving our Tanzanian league .
<3>	(22.010-28.310)	<hes> sababu ya kwanza mimi nahisi <breath> ni viwango vya wachezaji tulionao katika <breath> nchi yetu .	the first reason I feel is the quality of the players we have in our country .
<4>	(28.310-37.067)	ya kwamba hata ukiangalia katika ligi ya Tanzania <breath> wachezaji ambao wanakuja kuinua ligi wanaoleta changamoto kwenye ligi <breath> ni wachezaji .	in that even when you look at the Tanzania's league the players who come to uplift the league are the same players who bring challenges into the league .
<5>	(37.067-45.202)	utakuta ni mchezaji katolewa Brazil <breath> mchezaji katolewa Uganda mchezaji katolewa nchi nyingine <breath> tofauti na wale tulio nao <breath> katika nchi yetu .	you will find that this is a player from Brazil a player from Uganda a player from a country different from those we have in our country .
<6>	(45.202-57.520)	kwa hivyo vile viwango -- kile kiwango cha kumvutia mtu mimi nimshabikie nimshabikie labda <int> timu ya Simba <breath> nishabikie labda timu ya Yanga <breath> viwango vile vya kunifanya mimi niwashabikie <breath> sioni katika nchi yetu <int> .	therefore I don't see such levels -- the standards in our country to attract me into supporting a team like Simba to support a team like Yanga .
<7>	(57.520-58.030)	kwa nini ?	why ?
<8>	(58.030-74.943)	kwa sababu nakumbuka kwa mfano kuna kipindi <breath> -- kipindi cha Maximo akifundisha timu ya taifa aliimbua vipaji vingi sana vya vijana <breath> akawachukua wale watu wa- -- akaenda nao wakacheza ligi Brazil wakawa wameshinda <breath> lakini walivyorudishwa Tanzania wengi wao walitelekezwa wakaachwa vipaji vikawa vimekufa .	because I remember for example there was a time -- a time when Maximo was training the national team and arose so many talents in youths he took those people and went with them to play in the Brazil league where they won but when they were returned to Tanzania many of them were abandoned and their talents left to die .
<9>	(74.943-83.095)	<breath> lakini kutokana na kwamba hatuna viwango vya wachezaji wazuri <breath> unakuta wengi wetu hatushabikii ligi ya Tanzania tunashabikia <breath> ligi za nje .	but from the reason that we do not have high standards players you will find many of us do not support the Tanzanian league but support foreign leagues .
<10>	(83.095-94.940)	<breath> sababu nyingine nadhani ni kwamba kukosekana <breath> kwa timu katika mkoa tunayoishi <breath> ya kwamba mimi naishi Mwanza <breath> lakini katika mkoa wa Mwanza mzima <breath> hakuna timu katika ligi kuu .	another reason I think is the lack of a team from the provinces we live in in that I live in Mwanza but there is not team in the premier league in the whole of Mwanza province .
<11>	(94.940-101.960)	kwa hivyo mimi hainimotivate kabisa kushabikia timu -- kuishabikia ligi ya Tanzania <breath> ya Kwamba je nitashabikia timu gani ?	therefore it doesn't motivate me at all to support a team -- to support Tanzanian league . which team will I support ?
<12>	(101.960-108.500)	nadhani hilo na lenyewe linaweza kuwa ni sababu kwa baadhi ya mikoa unakuta <breath> kuna mikoa mwingine kama ukienda Dar es Salaam watu wanashabikia sana .	I think that can also be a reason for some provinces you will find some provinces like Dar es Salaam where people are very supportive .
<13>	(108.500-111.138)	kuna Simba kule kuna Azam kule kuna Yanga kule <breath> .	there is Simba there there is Azam there and there is Yanga there .
<14>	(111.138-114.930)	mtu kuna ile -- kuna motisha fulani ya kwe- -- ya yeye kushabikia .	a person has -- has that specific motivation for being supportive .
<15>	(114.930-120.520)	<breath> lakini ukija kwa sisi labda umeenda Shinyanga ju- -- juzi imepanda timu moja na stadi .	but when you come to us supposing you've moved to Shinyanga -- the other day there rose one skilled team .
<16>	(120.520-121.973)	<breath> yeah imepanda stadi .	yeah it's risen in skills .
<17>	(121.973-124.880)	<breath> kidogo ina wamotivate watu wapate kushabikia <breath> ligi .	it is motivating people a bit to support the league .
<18>	(124.880-129.231)	lakini ukija Mwanza timu yetu Toto ndiyo imelala pamba tumeshazisahau <breath> timu nyingi sana .	but if you come to Mwanza Toto our team is largely sleeping we have forgotten very many teams .
<19>	(129.231-132.980)	kwa hivyo una- -- unakuta sina mkali mimi ya kushabikia ligi .	therefore you got -- you find that I have no zeal to support the league .
<20>	(132.980-134.563)	sababu sina timu kwenye mkoa wangu .	because I don't have a team in my province .
<21>	(134.563-140.040)	<breath> ukienda mikoa mwingine kama Mara huko ndiyo hawatambui kabisa <breath> ya kwamba kuna ligi kwa sababu hakuna timu hata moja .	if you go to another province like Mara they do not recognize that there is a league at all because there is no single team .
<22>	(140.040-142.120)	kwa hivyo unakuta ile yenyewe ni sababu .	you'll therefore find that it is also a reason .
<23>	(142.120-146.690)	<breath> lakini sababu nyingine nadhani ni ile nature ya sisi mashabiki .	but I think another reason is our nature as supporters .
<24>	(146.690-156.150)	wengi wetu tumezoea mimi nimezoea mimi nisipoishabikia ulaya nikaja nikashabikia mpira ambao nauona ni wa kawaida kabisa kwangu mimi <breath> nadhani sio vizuri .	most of us are used to I am used to if I don't support Europe and come to support the soccer that I see as common in my view doesn't seem right .
<25>	(156.150-163.002)	na nature yangu ya kwamba nikiangalia ule mpira wa ulaya una mvuto fulani kwangu mimi tofauti <breath> na mpira Watanzania .	and my nature that watching the European soccer has a certain attraction to me different from the Tanzanian soccer .
<26>	(163.002-164.218)	kwa hivyo hayo ndiyo mawazo yangu nashukuru sana .	therefore those are my thoughts and I am very grateful .
<27>	(164.218-169.280)	nashukuru sana -- nakushukuru sana -- nakushukuru sana <sta> asante sana -- asante sana <hes> nakushukuru sana -- nakushukuru sana .	I am very grateful -- I am very grateful -- I am very grateful thank you a lot -- thank you a lot I am very grateful -- I am very grateful .
<28>	(169.280-173.535)	naona kuna mdau yuko tayari hapa (()) jezi ya <breath> -- ya Man_U .	I can see a stakeholder who's ready here (()) -- with a Man_U jersey .
<29>	(173.535-175.377)	ndugu yangu wewe we mshabiki wa Man_U ?	my brother are you a Man_U supporter ?
<30>	(175.377-176.690)	sana .	very much .
<31>	(176.690-180.783)	kwa nini pamoja na kuzabwazabwa makofi kupoteza poteza mechi nyingi kwa nini usiishabikie (()) sisi ?	after the various slaps and loss of many matches why can't you support we (()) ?
<32>	(180.783-181.664)	uhuh siwezi .	no I can't .
<33>	(181.664-182.212)	eh ?	yes ?
<34>	(182.212-184.210)	sababu imekuwa kama game yangu .	because it has become like my own game .
<35>	(184.210-192.610)	kweli tunapenda ligi za nje kuliko ligi ya ndani kwa sababu mbalimbali <breath> moja kwa moja nitaanza na hoja namba moja .	we truly love foreign leagues more than the local ones for various reasons I will directly start with the first point .
<36>	(192.610-199.455)	hoja namba moja <breath> mpira wa ulaya unatangazwa sana wamewekeza vizuri katika matangazo .	the first point is that the European league is very much publicized and they have invested well in publicity .
<37>	(199.455-202.330)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<38>	(202.330-214.334)	wamewekeza vizuri katika matangazo ikichezwa mechi kama El Clasico <no-speech> ambayo wakati mwingine wanaita football of the highest order wanapokutana Barcelona na Madrid .	they have invested well in publicity if a game like El Clasico is played which sometimes they call football of the highest order when Barcelona meets with Madrid .
<39>	(214.334-216.500)	tuna enjoy sana .	we really enjoy .
<40>	(216.500-228.510)	sasa ukija kuangalia <breath> mpira wa Simba labda na J_K_T Ruvu <no-speech> namna ya uchezaji uwanjani na <int> nini unakuta mvuto haupo .	now if you come to watch the match between Simba and maybe J_K_T Ruvu you will find no attraction in the style of playing in the pitch and others .
<41>	(228.510-231.557)	kwa hivyo tunatakiwa bado wakaze buti kutushawishi .	they are therefore required to work hard in convincing us .
<42>	(231.557-232.660)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<43>	(232.660-244.062)	hoja nyingine ili kuokoa muda <breath> ni kwamba baada ya michezo miaka ya elfu mbili <breath> kufutwa mashuleni ili- -- ilikuwa ikijulikana kama <breath> Umiseta .	another point for the sake of saving time is that after sports were scrapped off from schools -- in the two thousand years they used to be called UMISSETA .
<44>	(244.062-248.287)	UMITASHUMTA na Umisavuta kwa upande wa vyuoni .	UMITASHUMTA and UMISAVUTA on the college sides .
<45>	(248.287-253.610)	<breath> kwa hivyo hamasa <breath> kwa Watanzania kuanzia ngazi ya chini iliisha kabisa .	therefore the desire by Tanzanians to focus on the lower levels ended completely .
<46>	(253.610-263.994)	kilichobakia ni watu <breath> kuangalia matangazo ya mpira wa wachezaji wa ulaya <breath> kupitia kwenye lebo za big G au Jojo .	what remained was for people to observe the football announcements for the European players on labels like Big G or Jojo .
<47>	(263.994-265.188)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<48>	(265.188-269.740)	magazeti mbalimbali <breath> kwa nyumba za vijijini tulikuwa tunabandika ndani .	we used to stick several newspapers inside the houses in the villages .
<49>	(269.740-274.940)	nyumba yote ukiona Ronaldo de Lima <breath> yaani moyo wako unapenda kweli .	if you see Ronaldo de Lima inside the whole house the heart used to be very merry .
<50>	(274.940-284.041)	lakini kwa mchezaji wa ndani <breath> hatu- -- alikuwepo akina Lunyamila huwezi ukaona hata lebo ya picha yake iko kwenye Jojo hamna .	but for local players -- there were the likes of Lunyamila whose photo you'd never see on the labels of Jojo .
<51>	(284.041-288.360)	kwa hivyo Watanzania <breath> bado tunatakiwa tukaze buti .	therefore we Tanzanians are required to work hard .
<52>	(288.360-294.296)	hoja nyingine ya tatu <hes> mpira wa ulaya ni kama ajira .	the third point is that the European football is like employment .
<53>	(294.296-297.090)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<54>	(297.090-310.827)	mpira wa ulaya <sta> umefanywa kama ajira <no-speech> kwa mfano <no-speech> mchezaji mpira anaona kama kazi yake anacheza kwa kujituma <no-speech> anaonekana kama ndiye identity ya timu .	the European football has been designed like employment for example a football player views his work like he has sent himself and he is viewed as the identity of the team .
<55>	(310.827-318.690)	kwa mfano leo hii huwezi ukaniambia Wayne Rooney wa Manchester United akauzwa Chelsea bila sababu ya msingi <breath> .	for example today you can't tell me that Wayne Rooney of Manchester United has been sold to Chelsea without a principle reason .
<56>	(318.690-327.477)	lakini leo utaona Ngasa <breath> ambaye tulikuwa tunaona ni identity wa timu ya Yanga ameuzwa Azam amezunguka Simba <breath> ameenda wapi .	but today you will see Ngasa who we viewed as Yanga's identity has been sold to Azam has moved to Simba and elsewhere .
<57>	(327.477-334.108)	<breath> kwa hivyo mchezaji mwenyewe kama mwenyewe <breath> anapoteza ule mvuto <breath> wa nembo ya timu kama Yanga .	therefore a player can himself lose that symbolic attraction of a team like Yanga .
<58>	(334.108-340.384)	amekulia Yanga <breath> tunapenda kumsikia akiichezea Yanga <breath> mara ameenda Azam mara amerudi Simba mara .	he has grown in Yanga and we love hearing him playing for Yanga then suddenly he has gone to Azam and returned to Simba again .
<59>	(340.384-343.170)	sasa tunashindwa kuelewa ule mzunguko .	now we fail to understand that cycle .
<60>	(343.170-350.000)	hoja ya mwisho ili niwape nafasi wachangiaji wengine hoja zilikuwa nyingi <breath> <hes> ni kukubali matokeo .	the last point so that I give a chance to other contributors as these points were many is the acceptance of results .
<61>	(350.000-356.407)	leo hii Manchester akifungwa na timu hata ndogo <no-speech> matokeo yanakaa Kiulaya ulaya unakubali .	today if Manchester is beaten by even a small team the results are European like and Europe accepts .
<62>	(356.407-357.912)	you accept the result .	you accept the result .
<63>	(357.912-366.416)	<breath> lakini Simba akimfunga Yanga au Yanga akamfunga Simba <breath> basi maisha msimbazi maisha jangwani hayapo tena .	but if Simba beat Yanga or Yanga beats Simba then the reptile like and desert life is no more .
<64>	(366.416-369.239)	ni frustration kila upande .	it's frustrations from every side .
<65>	(369.239-377.389)	kwa hiyo hayo ndiyo yangu machache <breath> ambayo na -- nakushukuru sana na -- ndugu yangu Kulujila <sta> tunaendelea -- tunaendelea -- tunaendelea na kurejesha kurunzi michezoni .	therefore those are my sentiments in short and I am very grateful my brother Kulujila we are continuing -- we are continuing -- we are continuing with returning the searchlight .
<66>	(377.389-382.647)	mengi yamezungumzwa lakini nataka nikazie kwenye moja <no-speech> kuhusiana na upendeleo .	much has been said but I want to stress on one in regards to favoritism .
<67>	(382.647-396.352)	na katika swala la upendeleo ni nyinyi kwanza watu wa media kiukweli tukiangalia jinsi mnavyoipa promo Yanga mnavyoipa promo Simba Azam sio sawa na Toto <breath> <int> au timu nyingine ndogo .	and the issue of favoritism is with you media people if you truly look at the way you promote Yanga Simba Azam it is not the same as Toto or another small team .
<68>	(396.352-399.520)	kwa hivyo watu wa media kwanza ndiyo wanatuharibia ligi ya Bongo .	therefore you media are the people destroying the Tanzanian league .
<69>	(399.520-409.670)	watu wa media <breath> kwa sababu utakuta magazeti tu yameandikwa kwa timu tatu <no-speech> kila kona unapoenda ni timu tatu <breath> na kiukweli hizo timu tatu ambazo mnazipa promo ndiyo zinaharibu ligi ya Bongo .	you will find newspapers written by media people on just three teams and it is about these three teams at every corner and for sure the three teams that you give promo to are the ones spoiling the Tanzanian league .
<70>	(409.670-416.103)	kwa sababu utakuta Yanga na Simba <breath> tekniki yao kumshinda <hes> -- ya kumshinda Mtibwa <breath> ni kumnunua mchezaji wake mkali .	because you'll find that Yanga's and Simba's technique of beating -- of beating Mtibwa is by buying its skilled player .
<71>	(416.103-417.150)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<72>	(417.150-426.009)	badala tu ya kufikiria kuanzisha Academy kwa ajili ya kufundisha michezo <breath> unakuta Simba Yanga Azam <breath> wanapanga kuua timu wakinunua mchezaji wake ambaye wanamwaminia .	instead of just thinking of starting an academy for the purpose of training sports you will find that Simba Yanga Azam plan to kill a team when they buy its player whom they trust .
<73>	(426.009-434.489)	kwa hivyo media ndiyo zenyewe zinawabeba zile timu kubwa Yanga na Simba <breath> lakini ukiangalia kwa ligi kama ya Uingereza <breath> timu zote wanazipa hadhi sawa kati vyombo vya habari .	therefore it is the media itself that carries those big teams like Yanga and Simba but if you look at the European leagues all teams are given the same status in the media .
<74>	(434.489-439.310)	hicho ni kitu cha kwanza <breath> lakini kitu cha pili tu kwa haraka -- haraka kama walivyosema wenzangu ni teknolojia .	that is the first thing but the second thing quickly -- quickly as my colleagues said is technology .
<75>	(439.310-444.550)	unakuta sasa hivi kutoka <breath> Mwanza kwenda Uingereza ni karibu kuliko kutoka Mwanza kwenda Dar es Salaam .	you will find that right now from Mwanza to England is nearer than from Mwanza to Dar es Salaam .
<76>	(444.550-453.720)	unakuta ligi nyingi zinachezwa hujui mwisho wa siku <breath> tunakuja tunaonyeshwa ligi ambayo inapendelewa na T_F_F ligi ambayo inapendelewa na media <breath> ligi ambayo inapendelewa na wa- -- na makampuni mbalimbali .	you'll find many leagues being played but what you don't know is that at the end of the day we will be shown a league that is favored by T_F_F a league that is favored by media and a league that is favored by the -- by various companies .
<77>	(453.720-458.987)	unakuta Yanga na Simba <breath> wamepewa mabasi kwa ajili ya kuwachukua wachezaji kutoka sehemu moja mpaka sehemu nyingine .	you'll find that Yanga and Simba have been given buses for the purpose of ferrying the players from one area to another .
<78>	(458.987-460.569)	Mtibwa basi liko wapi ?	where is the bus for Mtibwa ?
<79>	(460.569-461.825)	Kagera basi liko wapi ?	where is the bus for Kagera ?
<80>	(461.825-468.409)	<breath> kwa hivyo moja kwa moja watu wanavutika tu kuangalia zile timu mbili <breath> na ndiyo maana watu wanapenda mechi ya Simba Yanga na Azam .	and therefore people are just directly attracted to watch those two teams and that is why people love the matches by Simba Yanga and Azam .
<81>	(468.409-478.296)	lakini mechi nyingine watu hawaangalii kwa sababu tu ya upendeleo uliopo kwenye T_F_F upendeleo uliopo kwenye media na upendeleo uliopo katika makampuni mbalimbali ambayo kimsingi ndiyo wadhamini wa <int> ligi ya Tanzania .	but people do not watch some matches just because of the favoritism that is in T_F_F favoritism in the media and favoritism in various companies which principally are the sponsors of the Tanzanian league .
<82>	(478.296-486.680)	<breath> kwa kweli teknolojia <breath> na umaskini wetu pia unatupooza kwa sababu kiwango cha makocha tulio nao <breath> sio kiwango kile ambacho makocha wanaofundisha timu za Uingereza .	for sure technology and our poverty is incapacitating us because the standards of the coaches we have are not the standards that coaches training in European teams have .
<83>	(486.680-501.390)	<breath> kutokana na umaskini wetu na kiukweli lazima tupende kitu ambacho kinapendeka <breath> kwa sababu huwezi ukanikalisha mimi nimewacha kazi zangu <breath> nianze kuangalia ligi ambayo inachezwa kama kichwa cha mwendawazimu niache kuangalia ligi ambayo inapigwa vizuri kabisa <breath> unafurahi kwa sababu michezo <breath> ni burudani .	due to our poverty and truthfully we have to love something that is lovable because you can't let me sit after leaving my work to watch a league that is played like a madman's head and fail to watch a league that is well played to my satisfaction because sports is entertainment .
<84>	(501.390-506.390)	mimi nashangilia ligi ya Bongo kwa sababu ya Yanga Yanga ikitoka kwenye ligi ya Bongo mimi sishangilii tena .	I spectate Tanzanian league because of Yanga but if Yanga leaves the league then I won't spectate again .
<85>	(506.390-512.218)	kwa sababu ndiyo timu tu -- ni kwa sababu ya uzalendo <breath> lakini Uingereza naweza nikaangalia timu yoyote mechi yoyote naweza nikaangalia .	because it is the only team -- it's because of patriotism but I can watch any European team and any match .
<86>	(512.218-515.795)	<breath> kwa sababu mchezo unaochezwa kweli unavutia macho na Watanzania tunapenda starehe .	because we Tanzanians love pleasure and the game that is played is attractive to the eyes .
<87>	(515.795-517.193)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<88>	(517.193-527.196)	<sta> asante sana -- asante sana <hes> kwa mchango wako nashukuru sana <hes> mdau ametupiga madogo vyombo vya habari vinafuatilia sana timu au tunapendelea timu .	thank you very much -- thank you very much for your contribution I am so grateful to you that viewer has hit the media about following up a lot and favoring teams .
<89>	(527.196-528.810)	haya <breath> hayo ni maoni yake .	fine those are his sentiments .
<90>	(528.810-534.860)	kitu cha kwanza ambacho naweza kusema kwamba uonyeshaji wa ligi ya Tanzania na uonyeshaji wa timu <breath> ni bovu .	the first thing that I can say is that the showing of the Tanzanian league and the showing of the team is terrible .
<91>	(534.860-536.650)	ambao nikianzia kwa T_F_F .	starting from T_F_F .
<92>	(536.650-546.106)	ambapo unaweza kuta T_F_F kwamba imekariri kwamba timu ya Tanzania hapa hivi zipo Simba na Yanga nimetolea tu mfano <breath> kwa hivyo Simba na Yanga ndiyo timu kongwe hapa Tanzania ambazo zimeanzia mapato .	you can find that T_F_F has insisted that the teams in Tanzania are Simba and Yanga and I am just giving an example therefore Simba and Yanga are the veteran teams here in Tanzania which have started earning .
<93>	(546.106-548.467)	kwa hivyo pi- -- piga au kwa vyovyote vile .	therefore -- fight or by any means .
<94>	(548.467-560.710)	<breath> mambo ambayo watafanya ita- -- ita- -- itakuwa inawafavour Simba na Yanga katika uonyeshaji wao na kitu kingine katika nani kilabu hapa hivi katika ku- -- ku- -- kuendeleza -- kuendeleza mpira katika nchi (()) unaanzia chini .	anything they will do will -- will -- will be favoring Simba and Yanga in their publicity another thing in clubs here in -- in promoting -- promoting football in (()) country starts lowly .
<95>	(560.710-576.735)	na ingawa kuna sheria kwamba ati kila ki- -- kilabu ambayo inashiriki kwenye ligi kuu lazima iwe na Academy lakini kwa -- kwa Bongo hapa hivi yaani hilo swala hapo ni utapeli kwa sababu unaweza kuta timu <breath> sawa -- sawa inaweza kuwa na Academy lakini Academy <breath> ni ya- -- inatokea pale ambapo wanakuja kukaguliwa na- -- kama na T_F_F wengi wao wanahonga .	and even though there are rules that every club that participates in the premier league must have an academy but for -- for Tanzania that is a con issue because you can find a capable team that can have an academy but the academy only resurfaces during the inspection and many of them bribe T_F_F .
<96>	(576.735-578.020)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<97>	(578.020-578.972)	unaona ?	do you understand ?
<98>	(578.972-587.240)	halafu kitu kingine nataka kusema kwamba makocha -- halafu ndiyo upu- -- upungufu wa makocha kwamba yaani uwezo wa makocha katika kucoach -- kucoach nani wachezaji .	then another thing I would like to say is on coaches then yes -- the shortcomings of coaches that is the coaches' capabilities to coach -- coach players .
<99>	(587.240-591.130)	kwa mfano leo -- leo hii Tanzania tuna makocha ambao wanaibua vipaji lakini sio kuendeleza vipaji .	for example today -- today in Tanzania we have coaches who discover talent but not those who can grow the talent .
<100>	(591.130-593.116)	hilo nalo ni tatizo unaona ?	this is also a problem understand ?
<101>	(593.116-603.723)	<breath> kwamba leo hii pia -- wajua kama ligi ya -- ya -- ligi ya nje mfano ligi ya- -- kama Uingereza kuna coaching ambao ameandikwa ajili ya Academy na coaching ambayo imeandikwa dhidi ya timu ya -- ya watu (()) <breath> under -- under twenty one au zaidi ya hapo hivyo .	that today also -- you know like the foreign league for example in England there are coaches employed because of the academy and coaches employed for the purpose of the team of -- of (()) people under -- under twenty one or more there .
<102>	(603.723-610.960)	<breath> lakini leo hii utakuta kocha Watanzania anaye teach Academy leo ameenda tena kufundisha katika timu ya watu wazima <breath> kitu ambacho -- kitu hicho ambacho haki- -- hakipo unaona ?	but today you will find that the Tanzania coach who teaches academy today goes again to train adults something that -- something that isn't there you see ?
<103>	(610.960-611.920)	<no-speech>	<no-speech>
<104>	(611.920-620.440)	halafu kitu ingine mimi nataka kusema kwamba hivi <breath> wachezaji sisi wenyewe tu- -- tujidhamini yaani tuwe -- tuwe na utu tuwe na utaifa ndani yetu na uzalendo tuwe nao .	and then another thing I want to say is that we players should guarantee ourselves we should be kind and have nationalism and patriotism inside us .
<105>	(620.440-626.270)	kwa sababu haiwezekani mimi leo hii kwamba -- sawa mi- -- mimi natambua hii timu ndiyo imenisaidia imenitoa mbali .	because it is not possible that today I recognize this team as having brought me from far .
<106>	(626.270-628.991)	kwa -- kama kwa mfano kama -- kwa mfano Toto (()) Toto .	for -- for example -- for -- for example Toto (()) Toto .
<107>	(628.991-651.150)	mimi nimezaliwa Mwanza nimekulia Toto nikachezea Toto lakini kwa maswala ya pesa ambayo pesa nayo haita- -- (()) chochote kwa maswala ya pesa <breath> unakuta watu wamesajiliwa kwa timu yoyote kwa vile unategemezwa na hii timu wewe unaondoka tu unaenda bila kuangalia nyuma kwamba ninavyoondoka hivi na naenda nabomoa timu yangu (()) na watu wengine maana uzalendo hatuna uzalendo hatuna na mashabiki hatuna <hes> nani uzalendo .	I was born in Mwanza and I have grown up in Toto and played for Toto but the issues of money whereby money won't (()) with anything on money matters you will find people signed up from any team because you're being shielded by the team you just leave without looking back and as I leave I go and start my (()) team with other people because because we have no patriotism we have no fans .
<108>	(651.150-661.170)	kwa sababu kama <breath> -- kama wewe usipende kitu chako hakuna ambaye ata- -- ataamini kitu -- kitu cha mwingine kama wewe umependa ligi ya -- ligi ya -- ya Uingereza haitatokea leo Mwingereza atoke Uingereza aje -- aje aseme ligi yako hicho kitu hakipo <breath> unaona ?	because if you can't love your thing there is no one who will -- will believe a thing -- someone's thing and if you love the England league there won't come an Englishman from England to talk about your league that thing isn't there you see ?
<109>	(661.170-663.120)	kwa hivyo na sisi wa- -- watazamaji tuwe na nini ?	therefore what should we viewers have ?
<110>	(663.120-665.030)	tuwe na uzalendo katika ligi zetu .	we should be patriotic in our leagues .
<111>	(665.030-666.134)	eh ndiyo hayo .	yes that is it .
<112>	(666.134-667.434)	asante sana nashukuru sana asante sana %incomplete	thank you very much I am very grateful %incomplete
