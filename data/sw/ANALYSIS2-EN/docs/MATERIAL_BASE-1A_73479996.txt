<4>	USAFIRI kwa njia ya barabara, umegeuka tishio kwa maisha.	travelling by road has turned out to be dangerous for life.
<5>	Wiki hii zimetokea ajali tofauti ambazo zimesababisha vifo vya zaidi ya watu 20.	this week various accidents have occurred causing the death of more than 20 people.
<6>	Basi la New Force linalofanya safari kati ya Dar es Salaam na Songea mkoa wa Ruvuma, limesababisha vifo vya watu 12 na majeruhi 30 baada ya kuacha njia na kupinduka.	the New Force Bus, which makes the journey between Dar es Salaam and Songea, Ruvuma province, has caused the deaths of 12 people and injured 30 after leaving the road and rolling.
<7>	Ajali nyingine iliyosababisha vifo vya watu wapatao 13 na zaidi ya 10 kujeruhiwa, ilitokana na basi la Super Shem ambalo liligongana na daladala katika kijiji cha Mwamaya katika eneo la Hungumalwa, mkoani Mwanza.	another accident that resulted in the deaths of 13 people and injured more than 10 was caused by the Super Shem bus which collided with a bus in the Mwamaya village in the area of Hungumalwa, Mwanza Province.
<8>	Zinapotokea ajali, mengi husemwa.	whenever accidents occur, a lot is said.
<9>	Kila mtu kwa mtazamo wake, hujaribu kueleza kinachochangia wimbi hili la ajali.	everyone will try to explain this wave contributing to the accidents with their own perspectives.
<10>	Miongoni mwa maoni yanayotolewa hujielekeza kuhoji sababu ya ajali kuendelea kuwapo licha ya wasimamizi wa sheria za barabarani kuwapo.	among the recommendations made is to focus on questioning the cause of these accidents despite traffic law managers being there.
<11>	Wengine hushutumu abiria kwa kutokuwa sehemu ya wadhibiti wa madereva wanaoendesha vyombo vya moto bila uangalifu.	others accuse passengers of not controlling drivers who drive vehicles without being careful.
<12>	Wakati mwendokasi na barabara mbovu vinatajwa kuwa chanzo, inashauriwa mfumo mzima wa uendeshaji kufumuliwa kuanzia aina ya madereva wanaofaa kubeba roho za watu.	while speed and poor roads are mentioned as the source, it is recommended that the entire driving system should be reformed starting with drivers who are entitled to carry humans.
<13>	Wapo wanaoshauri kuwepo sheria ya kulazimisha magari yote kila mwaka kufanyiwa uchunguzi wa kina na pia mabasi yasimamiwe na wataalamu kama vile Chuo cha Usafirishaji kupata leseni za kubeba abiria kwa mwaka huo.	there are those who advise that there should be a law which forces all vehicles to undergo an annual comprehensive inspection and for buses to be managed by professionals who have obtained a license at the college of transportation in order to carry passengers for that year.
<14>	Ajira na mikataba ni suala lingine linalotajwa ikishauriwa usafirishaji abiria usiachwe holela bali ziachiwe kampuni kubwa zenye uwezo na zitakazoweza kutoa huduma kwa wananchi na vyombo vya umma kama ilivyo treni.	jobs and contracts are other issues mentioned with the recommendation that transportation of passengers should not be given carelessly but left to bigger companies that will be able to provide services to citizens similar to the train.
<15>	Ikija suala la uwajibikaji wa abiria kudhibiti madereva, abiria pia wanabebeshwa mzigo kwa kutetea madereva wavunja sheria kwa kigezo cha kuchelewa.	regarding the issue of the passenger's responsibility in controlling drivers, the passengers are also burdened with speaking to drivers who break the law because they are late.
<16>	Mara nyingi, baadhi ya abiria hutetea uovu wa madereva na ajali ikishatokea, ndipo hufunguka kutoa lawama kwamba dereva alikuwa anaendesha vibaya.	many times, some passengers defend the incorrect actions of the drivers and open up to blaming the driver for driving recklessly after an accident happens.
<17>	Kwa ujumla, ajali hizi za mfululizo, zinachanganya akili za watu.	in general, these continuous accidents confuse people's brains.
<18>	Imefika hatua, wengine wamekwenda mbali na kuzihusisha na masuala ya kiimani.	it has reached a point where others have gone as far as relating them with matters of faith.
<19>	Wengine wakidai ni makafara.	others claiming it is sacrifices.
<20>	Wengine wakidai kuna ‘vibwengo’ wanaosababisha ajali.	others claim there are demons causing the accidents.
<21>	Kwa wenye mtazamo wa kiimani, hitimisho lao ni kuomba na kuombea taifa liepukane na janga hili.	for those with a perspective on faith, their conclusion is to pray and pray for the nation to stop this disaster.
<22>	Hata hivyo hakuna maoni ya kupuuza.	however, there are no opinions to ignore.
<23>	Lolote lawezekana.	anything is possible.
<24>	Hata hayo ya kiimani, ingawa ni vigumu kuthibitisha, si vibaya viongozi wa dini na wananchi kwa ujumla, kila mtu kwa imani yake kuomba bila kukoma matukio haya yakome.	even the ones about faith, though hard to confirm, it is not bad for religious leaders and the citizens in general and everyone in their faith to continue praying for these incidents to stop.
<25>	Umefika wakati kwa mamlaka kubana wamiliki kuajiri madereva wanaoeleweka kwa ajili ya mabasi ya abiria.	the time has come for authorities to pressure owners to employ drivers who understand the rules for the sake of these passenger buses.
<26>	Udereva usiishie kwenye kuwasha gari, kushika usukani, kukanyaga mafuta na kushika breki.	driving shouldn't end with starting the car, holding the steering, stepping on the fuel and breaking.
<27>	Bali wawe ni watu wenye utu na ubinadamu utakaowasukuma kuzingatia kanuni za barabarani.	but they should be people with kindness and humanity that can push them to focus on the road rules.
<28>	Dereva lazima aendeshe gari akiwa katika afya nzuri kwa maana asiwe mgonjwa au amechoka.	a driver must drive a vehicle while in good health, meaning he shouldn't be sick or tired.
<29>	Zaidi anashauriwa anapojisikia kuchoka wakati wa kuendesha, atafute sehemu salama ya kusimama na kupumzika.	instead, if he feels tired while driving, he's advised to find a safe place to stop and rest.
<30>	Anapaswa apumzike kwa dakika 30 kila baada ya kuendesha kwa saa tatu.	he's supposed to rest for 30 minutes after every three hours of driving.
<31>	Hapaswi kuendesha kwa zaidi ya saa tisa kwa siku.	he shouldn't drive for more than nine days in a day.
<32>	Jiulize, ni madereva wangapi wa masafa marefu, hasa mabasi ya abiria, wanaozingatia hili?	ask yourself, how many long distant drivers, especially of passenger buses, pay attention to this?
<33>	Mbona yanashuhudiwa mabasi yakiwa na dereva mmoja tangu alfajiri hadi usiku wa manane bila mapumziko.	why are there buses where you can see one driver from morning to midnight without rest.
<34>	Kwa mtindo huo, ajali zitakoma?	with that style, will accidents cease?
<35>	Ajali za mfululizo zilizohusisha mabasi ya abiria, karibu zote uchunguzi wa awali, unabainisha tatizo ni kutozingatia kanuni.	for almost all the investigations done earlier on a series of accidents that involved passenger buses, it was revealed that the problem was not paying attention to rules.
<36>	Ubishi, ubabe na kiburi kwa madereva vimetawala.	arguments, authoritarianism and arrogance in drivers rule.
<37>	Tatizo linakuwa kubwa kutokana na baadhi ya wasimamizi wa Usalama Barabarani kuendekeza vitendo vya rushwa na kutengeneza urafiki usiotoa nafasi ya kuwaadhibu.	the problem becomes a big one because some road safety supervisors promote corrupt actions and create friendships with drivers so that there is no chance to punish them.
<38>	Aidha adhabu zilizowekwa, ni ndogo kiasi cha kutoogopwa.	additionally, the fines in place are to small to be feared.
<39>	Unategemea dereva atakuwa na hofu kama kosa la Usalama Barabarani anatozwa faini ya Sh 100,000!	you can expect a driver to be afraid of being fined if you're fined 100, 000 shillings for a traffic offense!
<40>	Wakati tukiendelea kuomboleza vifo vya wenzetu waliopoteza maisha katika ajali barabarani, umefika wakati pia wa kutafakari sheria za Usalama Barabarani.	while mourning the deaths our colleagues who have lost their lives in road accidents, the time has also come to meditate on the rules of road safety.
<41>	Bila sheria kuangaliwa upya, ushauri kwa madereva kuhakikisha hawanywi pombe na kuendesha, utaendelea kupuuzwa.	without the rules being reviewed afresh, the advice to drivers that they don't drink alcohol and drive will continue being ignored.
<42>	Aidha fujo za madereva kujaribu kupita walio mbele, hazitakoma.	besides, the disorder of drivers trying to overtake those ahead will not stop.
<43>	Hahitaji elimu ya digrii dereva kutambua kwamba kabla ya kupita gari lingine, lazima ajiridhishe kwamba upo upenyo mkubwa wa kutosha mbele ya gari unalotaka kupita.	it doesn't take an educational degree to realize that before overtaking another car, you must be sure there is enough space in front of the car you want to overtake.
<44>	Lakini kiburi na ubabe unaochangiwa pia na ulevi (hususan wa viroba), vimetawala barabarani kiasi cha madereva wengi kutozingatia sheria.	but arrogance and authoritarianism, also contributed to with alcohol (especially parcel liquor), have governed the road to the extent of drivers not following rules.
<45>	Huwa inashangaza kuona dereva akiendesha kwa kasi kwenye kona au juu ya kilele cha mlima ambako ni vigumu kuona iwapo kutakuwapo gari lililoharibika mahali.	it's usually shocking to see a driver driving fast around a corner or on top of a hill where it is hard to see if there is a car that has broken down somewhere.
<46>	Pamoja na madereva, abiria, mamlaka zinazosimamia usalama barabarani, wamiliki wa magari (hasa ya abiria), kuwa sehemu ya sababu za ajali, isisahaulike ubora na uimara wa vipuri vya magari vinavyoingizwa nchini.	together with drivers, passengers, the authorities overseeing road safety and vehicle owners (especially of passengers) being part of the reasons for accidents, the quality of the strength of spares being brought into the country should not be forgotten.
<47>	Udhibiti wa ajali hizi unahitaji ushirikiano wa pamoja chini ya mamlaka zenye dhamana.	the control of these accidents needs unified cooperation under the authorities with securities.
<48>	Ifike wakati, mtu anaposafiri awe na amani tofauti na sasa ambapo ukiwa safarini, roho iko mkononi.	there should be a time, when a person traveling should have a different faith from now where you're heart is in your hands while traveling.
