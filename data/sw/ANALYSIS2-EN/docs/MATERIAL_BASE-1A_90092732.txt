<1>	Umuhimu wa kamera za CCTV	the importance of CCTV cameras
<2>	Siku moja nilikuwa niko safarini nikaona basi lililokuwa linakuja mbele yangu likilipita jingine kwa mwendo wa kasi.	one day, I was on a journey and saw a bus approaching in front of me which was overtaking another at great speed.
<3>	Almanusura basi hilo hilo litugonge, nikatoa taarifa kwa kikosi cha usalama barabarani, walichotaka kutoka kwangu ni kutaja namba za gari, sikuweza kuwapatia licha ya kuwaeleza kuwa basi hilo lilikuwa linaelekea katika mizani ya Vigwaza muda mfupi.	the bus almost hit us, I reported this to the traffic police and what they wanted from me was the vehicle's registration number which I was not able to provide, however, I informed them that the bus was heading towards the weighbridge of Vigwaza moments ago.
<4>	Kwa kawaida kituo cha polisi wa usalama barabarani makao makuu, kilitakiwa kuwa na uwezo wa kuchungulia kamera za mizani pale Vigwaza.	as usual the traffic police station headquarters needed the ability to check their weighbridge cameras at Vigwaza.
<5>	Nilitarajia askari wangewasiliana na watumishi wa mizani ili wapate ruhusa ya kuan galia video ya basi hilo kwa ajili ya kuchukua hatua za kisheria.	I expected the police to communicate with the attendants at the weighbridge to get permission to view the video of the bus so that legal action to be taken.
<6>	Au kama basi hilo lingekuwa na mtambo wa kufuatiliwa na jeshi la polisi, ingekuwa rahisi kujua undani wa kilichotokea.	or if the bus had a gadget that could be monitored by police force, it could be easy to know the reality of what happened.
<7>	Na njia hii ni mwafaka katika kudhibiti madereva wanaoendesha kwa mwendo wa kasi, kwani wanajua wanafuatiliwa.	and this approach would be effective in controlling drivers who speed, since they know they are being monitored.
<8>	Hivi karibuni, rafiki yangu akiwa maeneo ya Oysterbay jijini Dar es Salaam, alishuhudia wezi wakivunja kioo cha gari na kuiba kompyuta ndogo.	recently, while in the Oysterbay area in Dar es Salaam, a friend of mine witnessed thieves breaking the window of a car and stealing a mini laptop.
<9>	Nilimshauri kurudi eneo hilo na kuomba apewe mkanda wa picha zilizopigwa na kamera ili kubaini wezi, kwani walifika eneo la tukio wakiwa na gari.	I advised him to go back to the area and request a video tape taken by the camera to ascertain the theft since they arrived at the location of the car incident.
<10>	Kwa kutumia kamera ni rahisi kubaini gari walilotumia lilikuwa la aina gani na pia kujua namba zake.	using a camera, it is easy to determine what kind of vehicle was used and identify its registration number.
<11>	Matukio ya watu kuibiwa vitu katika magari katika maeneo mbalimbali ya maegesho nchini, ni mengi kwa sasa.	the incidence of items being stolen from individuals' vehicles in various parking lots is currently on the rise around the country.
<12>	Kibaya zaidi maeneo mengi hayana kamera zinazoweza kurekodi matukio yanayofanyika katika eneo husika.	even worse, many areas have no cameras that can record these incidents occurring in concerned areas.
<13>	Kimsingi, hatuwezi kuwa na maeneo yenye mkusanyiko mkubwa wa watu kama viwanja vya mpira, maduka makubwa ya bidhaa kama Mlimani City na maeneo ya burudani, tukashindwa kuweka kamera za ulinzi kubaini wahalifu na kuwachukulia hatua.	fundamentally, we cannot have areas where lots of people gather such as football pitches, big shopping centers like Mlimani City and recreational centers but fail to install CCTV cameras to identify criminals and take action against them.
<14>	Wenzetu Kenya, serikali kwa kushirikiana na kampuni ya Safaricom, wamefunga kamera za usalama kwenye maeneo nyeti ya nchi hiyo.	for our colleagues in Kenya, the government, in partnership with the Safaricom company, have installed security cameras in critical areas around the country.
<15>	Mwaka 2015 nchini Ghana, kulitokea mlipuko wa moto katika kituo cha mafuta jijini Accra.	in 2015 in Ghana, a fire blast erupted at a petrol station in the town of Accra.
<16>	Taarifa za awali zilisema kulikuwa na mvua kubwa, watu wakaenda kujificha kwenye kituo hicho.	earlier reports indicated that there were heavy rains and people went to shelter at that station.
<17>	Kituo hicho kilikuwa kimefungwa kamera za usalama, lakini kompyuta yake ilikuwa hapo hapo ndani, kwa hiyo wakati wa moto nayo iliathirika.	the station had installed security cameras, but its computer was inside there, and so during the inferno it was also burnt.
<18>	Kama kamera za kituo hicho zingekuwa zimeunganishwa na jeshi la polisi, nakala za picha zingepatikana na hatua zingeweza kuchukuliwa haraka kuhusu moto huo.	if the camera of that station could have been linked to the police force, video recordings could have been retrieved and action immediately taken concerning the fire.
<19>	Nadhani ni wakati mwafaka kwa Serikali yetu kupitia Jeshi la Polisi na idara nyingine kubadilisha sheria mbalimbali za ulinzi na usalama, ili ziweke ulazima wa majengo makubwa na maeneo ya mkusanyiko kuwa na kamera hizi ambazo zitaunganishwa na mtandao wa polisi.	I think it is the right time for our government, through the police force and other departments, to change various security and safety laws to make it mandatory for big buildings and crowded places to have these cameras which will be connected to police network.
<20>	Tuamue sasa kuwa eneo lolote linaokusanya watu zaidi ya 300 lifungwe kamera, magari ya abiria yafungwe mitambo maalumu ya ulinzi.	let's decide now that any area that has gatherings of more than 300 individuals should have cameras installed, and public service vehicles should be installed with a special security gadget.
<21>	Kwa kufanya hivi tutaweza kupunguza matukio mengi ya uhalifu yanayolisumbua Taifa kwa sasa.	in doing this, we will be able to reduce many criminal incidences that are currently troubling the nation.
<22>	Hata matukio ya kigaidi yanaweza kuzuilika kwa kuwa na kamera hizi zinazoweza kurekodi mienendo ya watu na magari.	even incidents of terror can be averted by having these cameras which can record movements of people and vehicles.
<23>	Haiwezekani tukawa na majengo makubwa na maeneo yenye mkusanyiko wa watu, lakini hayana mifumo yoyote ya usalama, tuanze sasa.	we cannot have big buildings and crowded areas that do not have any form of security, let's start now.
