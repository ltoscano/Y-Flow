<3>	MAKUBALIANO ya mkataba wa awali (MoU), uliosainiwa hivi karibuni baina ya Rais wa Serikali ya Mapinduzi Zanzibar (SMZ), Dk Ali Mohamed Shein, na kampuni ya kimataifa ya mafuta ya Shell unaohusu utafutaji na hatimaye uchimbaji wa mafuta, umeelezwa kuwa ni mkataba ‘feki’ na usiokuwa na uhalali wowote kisheria.	the initial contract agreement (MoU) that was signed recently between the President of the revolution government of Zanzibar (SMZ), Doctor Ali Mohamed Shem, and the international petroleum company, Shell, concerning searching and mining of oil was explained as a fake agreement without any constitutional legitimacy.
<4>	Magwiji wa sheria na mikataba nchini, Profesa Issa Shivji na Dk Rugemeleza Nshala, kwa nyakati tofauti, wameliambia gazeti hili kuwa hicho kinachodaiwa kusainiwa na Dk Shein na kampuni hiyo ya Shell, hakipo kisheria kwa maelezo kwamba mafuta na gesi asilia ni mambo yaliyo chini ya Muungano, na kwa hiyo mwenye mamlaka ya kusaini mkataba wa aina hiyo kwa niaba ya Serikali ya Tanzania, ni waziri mwenye dhamana kuhusu masuala ya nishati.	contract law experts in the country, Professor Issa Shivji and Doctor Rugemeleza Nshala, have separately told this newspaper that what was claimed to be signed by Doctor Shein and Shell is not constitutional with the explanation that oil and gas are affairs which come under the union, and the person authorized to sign such contracts on behalf of the government of Tanzania is the minister responsible for matters of energy.
<5>	Katika toleo la wiki iliyopita, gazeti hili lilibeba habari kuu iliyokuwa ikielezea namna Dk Shein alivyoingia makubaliano ya awali (MoU) na kampuni kubwa ya kimataifa inayojishughulisha na biashara ya nishati ya mafuta na gesi asilia, Shell, wakati akiwa katika ziara yake ya kiserikali nchini Uholanzi, Agosti mwaka huu.	in last week's edition, this newspaper had a major article that explained how Doctor Shein entered into the initial agreement (MoU) with the largest international company dealing in the energy of oil and natural gas, Shell, while in his official government tour to Holland, in August this year.
<6>	Katika mkataba huo wa makubaliano ya awali, SMZ imeipatia kampuni hiyo ya Shell idhini ya kutafiti na hatimaye kuchimba mafuta katika vitalu vinne, vilivyopo Zanzibar, vilivyopewa majina ya Block 9,10,11 na 12.	in the initial contract agreement, SMZ has given Shell the go ahead to search for and finally mine oil in the four walls located in Zanzibar named Block 9, 10, 11 and 12.
<7>	Akizungumzia hatua hiyo wiki iliyopita akiwa mjini Kilwa Masoko kwa ajili ya kutoa mafunzo yanayohusiana na masuala ya mafuta na gesi kwa wanahabari nchini, yaliyoandaliwa na Baraza la Habari Tanzania (MCT), Profesa Shivji, alisema Dk Shein hana mamlaka yoyote hadi sasa ya kisheria kusaini mkataba wowote unaohusiana na masuala ya mafuta na gesi ndani ya eneo la Jamhuri ya Muungano ya Tanzania.	when talking about that last week while in Kilwa Masoko in order to offer education on issues concerning oil and gas to journalists in the country organized by Tanzanian media cooperation (MCT), Professor Shivji, said that Doctor Shein does not currently have any constitutional authority to sign a contract concerning matters of oil and gas within the land under the united republic of Tanzania.
<8>	Alisema mafuta na gesi ni mambo ya Muungano, na kwa hiyo mamlaka pekee yenye uhalali wa kisheria kusaini mkataba wowote unaohusiana na jambo hilo, ni Serikali ya Jamhuri ya Muungano ya Tanzania.	he said that oil and gas are the affairs of the union and for that the only authority with constitutional legitimacy to sign any contract concerning the matter is the government of the United Republic of Tanzania.
<9>	Aidha, Profesa Shivji aliwataka Watanzania kuwapuuza wote wanaodai kwamba masuala ya mafuta na gesi asilia viliingizwa kinyemela katika mambo yote ya Muungano, akisisitiza kwamba maliasili hiyo iliongezwa kwenye mambo ya Muungano mwaka 1968 wakati wa utawala wa Mzee Abeid Amani Karume.	moreover, Professor Shivji needed Tanzanians to ignore all the claims that matters of oil and natural gas were included in all affairs of the union for selfish gains, emphasizing that those resources were included in the affairs of the union in 1968 during the reign of Mzee Abeid Amani Karume.
<10>	“Masuala ya mafuta na gesi yaliongezwa kwenye mambo ya Muungano na Mzee Karume mwenyewe mwaka 1968.	"matters of oil and gas were added into the affairs of the union by Mzee Karume himself in 1968.
<11>	Zitafuteni Hansard (taarifa mazungumzo yaliyofanyika ndani ya Bunge), zipo.	look for the Hansard (transcriptions that took place in parliament), they are available.
<12>	Hao wanaopiga propaganda kwamba mambo hayo yaliingizwa kinyemela kwenye mambo ya Muungano ni watu wa kupuuzwa,” alisema Profesa Shivji.	those who are spreading propaganda that those matters were included into the affairs of the union for selfish gains are people to be ignored," Professor Shivji said.
<13>	Kwa upande wake, Dk Nshala alisema kwa kusaini makubaliano hayo, si tu kwamba Dk Shein amevunja Katiba, bali hata kampuni yenyewe ya Shell iliyosaini mkataba huo, imesaini mkataba kanyaboya (feki) kutokana na kile alichosema kampuni hiyo imeingia makubaliano na mtu asiyehusika kwa mujibu wa sheria ya sasa ya madini, mafuta na gesi.	on his side, Doctor Nshala said that the signing of the agreements is not simply about  Doctor Shein breaking the constitution but also Shell signed the contract, it signed a fake contract from what he said, and so the company entered into an agreement with a person not involved with oil and gas, according to current mineral laws.
<14>	“Mwenye mamlaka ya kisheria kusaini mkataba wowote unaohusu nishati na madini, kwa mujibu wa Katiba yetu, kwa niaba ya Serikali yetu, ni Waziri wa Nishati na Madini.	"the person with the legal authority to sign any contract concerning energy and minerals according to our constitution, on behalf of our government is the minister of energy and minerals.
<15>	Suala la mafuta na gesi asilia viko chini ya Muungano, Dk Shein hana uhalali wowote wa kusaini mkataba wa mafuta, gesi wala madini…unajua kuna watu wanataka kutumia kipindi hiki ambacho tuko kwenye mchakato wa kuandika Katiba Mpya kuvuruga Muungano,” anasema Dk Nshala ambaye amebobea katika masuala ya mikataba ya madini, mafuta na gesi.	the matters of oil and natural gas are under the union, Doctor Shein has no authority to sign oil, gas or minerals contracts... you there are people who want to use this period when we are in the process of writing a new constitution to disrupt the union," says Doctor Nshala who is specialized in issues of mineral, oil and gas contracts.
<16>	Raia Mwema linafahamu kwamba ingawa MoU inaonyesha kwamba walioingia makubaliano ni Shein na Mtendaji Mkuu wa Shell, Peter Voser, aliyesaini mkataba huo kwa niaba ya Shein ni Waziri wa Nishati wa SMZ, Ramadhan Abdallah Shaaban.	Raia Mwema understands that even though the MoU shows that those who entered into the agreement are Shein and the Chief Executive Officer of Shell, Peter Voser, the person who signed the contract on behalf of Shein was the SMZ Minister of energy, Ramadhan Abdalla Shaaban.
<17>	Hata hivyo, kwa mujibu wa Katiba na maelezo ya Prof. Shivji na Dk. Nshalla, aliyepaswa kusaini makubaliano kama hayo kwa sasa ni Waziri wa Nishati na Madini, Prof. Sospeter Muhongo.	even so, in accordance with the constitution and the explanation of Professor Shivji and Doctor Nshalla, currently, the person supposed to sign contracts like that is the minister of energy and minerals, Professor Sospeter Muhongo.
