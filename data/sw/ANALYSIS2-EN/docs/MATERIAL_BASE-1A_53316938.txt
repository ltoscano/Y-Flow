<4>	WAKATI zoezi la sensa ya watu na makazi likiendelea nchini kote wakazi wa kijiji cha Myunga kata ya Myunga wilayani Momba mkoani Mbeya wamesisitiza azma yao ya kutohesabiwa hadi pale serikali itakapotoa tamko juu ya kulindwa kwa mtuhumiwa wa mauaji ya njia za ushirikina yaliyodaiwa kufanywa na mfanyabiashara mmoja kijijini hapo.	while the population and housing shelter census exercise is ongoing across the whole country, residents of Myunga village in Myunga Division, Momba district, in Mbeya province, have asserted their desire to not be counted until the government issues a statement about the protection of a witchcraft murder suspect that was alleged to have been committed by one businessman in the village.
<5>	Wananchi hao walizungumza katika kikao maalumu cha kutathmini mauaji yaliyotokea kijijini hapo na kusababisha uvunjifu wa amani uliotokana na kuuawa kwa wakazi wa kijiji hicho na kunyofolewa sehemu za siri ambapo hata hivyo mtuhumiwa wa mauaji hayo alitimuliwa kijijini hapo baada ya wananchi wenye hasira kubomoa na kuchoma nyumba yake.	the citizens were speaking in a special session to evaluate the killings that happened in the village, which resulted in a disturbance of peace caused by the murder of some villagers, who had their private parts dismembered. however, the murder suspect was chased from the village after angry citizens demolished and burnt his house.
<6>	Madai ya kuwepo kwa mauaji ya kishirikina yaliibuliwa mwezi Machi mwaka huu ambapo jumla ya watu saba waliuawa na miili yao kukutwa pembezoni mwa mto Momba ambapo mara baada ya wananchi hao kupiga kura walimbaini mfanyabiashara huyo (jina tunalo) kuwa anahusika na mauaji hayo.	allegations of there being superstition-related killings emerged in March of this year, when a total of seven people were killed and their bodies found on the banks of Momba river. the citizens took a vote and determined that the businessman (we have the name) was linked to the killings.
<7>	Wakielezea ushahidi wa kuthibitisha kuhusishwa kwa mfanyabiashara huyo wakazi wa kijiji hicho walisema kuwa baadhi ya nguo za watu waliouawa zilikutwa nyumbani kwa mfanyabiashara huyo zikiwa zimetapakaa damu huku kukiwa na baadhi ya silaha kama vile visu na mapanga ambayo yanadaiwa kutumika kufanya mauaji.	while explaining the evidence to prove the involvement of the businessman, the residents of the village said that some of the victims' clothes were found in the businessman's home with blood stains on them, and there were also some weapons such as knives and machetes, which are claimed to have been used to carry out the murders.
<8>	Jofrey Simwanza mkazi wa kijiji cha Lwasho katika kata ya Myunga alisema kuwa mmoja wa vijana waliouawa aliyefahamika kwa jina la Shati Sichula mwili wake ulikutwa chini ya daraja la mto Momba huku mwili wake ukiwa umeondolewa baadhi ya viungo kama vile sehemu za siri, macho na ulimi.	Jofrey Simwanza, a resident of Lwasho village in Myunga division, said that the body of one of the youths who were killed, known as Shati Sichula, was found under the bridge of river Momba. his body had been dismembered of several organs such as private parts, eyes and tongue.
<9>	Alisema kuwa matukio ya mauaji hayo yaliendelea ambapo mwezi Juni mwili wa msichana mmoja ulikutwa ukielea katika mto Momba huku ukiwa umekatwa matiti na kunyofolewa ulimi,macho na sehemu za siri ambapo matukio hayo yalisababisha wananchi kuhoji sababu za mfanyabiashara huyo kutochukuliwa hatua za kisheria.	he said that these killing incidents continued when in June one girl's body was found floating in river Momba with the breasts removed and the tongue, eyes and private parts dismembered. these incidents resulted in the villagers questioning the reasons why legal proceedings have not been taken against the businessman.
<10>	Akizungumzia matukio hayo kijijini hapo Ofisa mtendaji wa kata hiyo Salum Jonas alisema kuwa kata hiyo yenye wakazi wanaokadiriwa kufikia 1,200 na kaya 200 wanaishi katika hofu kutokana na mauaji yaliyotokea ambayo yanahusishwa na imani za ushirikina hali ambayo inawafanya wakimbie nyumba zao na kuishi porini.	speaking about the incidents in the village, the executive Officer for the division, Salum Jonas, said that the division of approximately 1,200 residents and 200 homes live in fear from the killings that have happened which are associated with superstitious beliefs, a situation that has made them run from their houses and live in the wild.
<11>	Alisema kuwa mara baada ya kutokea kwa mauaji hayo wananchi walivamia nyumba tatu za watu wanaohisiwa kuwa ni wauaji na kuzichoma moto na kisha kubomoa na kusababisha upotevu wa mali zilizokuwemo katika nyumba hizo.	he said that soon after the occurrence of those killings, the villagers attacked three houses belonging to people who are suspected to be killers and set them on fire and then demolished them and caused loss of the property that was in those houses.
<12>	Alisema kuwa hatua hiyo ilisababisha jeshi la polisi kuwakamata wananchi wapatao 45 wakiwemo wafanyakazi wanaojenga barabara ya Tunduma- Sumbawanga ambao wanaishi kijijini hapo na kwamba hata hivyo baadhi yao waliachiwa huru na kubakizwa watuhumiwa 13 ambao wanahusishwa na kosa la jinai la kuvunja na kuiba.	he said that this caused the police force to arrest about 45 residents, including workers who are building the Tunduma-Sumbawanga road, who live in the village and that, however, some of them were set free and remained with about 13 suspects, who are associated with the felony of burglary and theft.
<13>	Kwa upande wao wananchi wa kijiji hicho walidai kuwa utaratibu uliotumika kuwakamata watuhumiwa hao haukuwa wa kibinadamu kwa kuwa askari waliotumwa kuwakamata walivamia nyumba na kubomoa milango na kuwakamata baadhi ya akina mama wakiwa uchi na kuwapakiza katika gari la polisi nyakati za usiku.	on their part, the residents of that village claimed that the procedure used to arrest the suspects was inhumane, as the police who were sent to arrest them attacked the houses and broke down doors and arrested some women while they were naked and loaded them in the police vehicle during the nighttime.
<14>	Walisema kuwa kitendo hicho kinashindwa kuwabaini watu wema na wahalifu ambapo hata watu watakaokuja kuhesabu sense wanadaiwa kuja nyakati za usiku hali ambayo bado itajenga hofu kwa wao kutoa ushirikiano kwa makarani wa sensa.	they said the act is unable to differentiate between the innocent and criminals in that even the people who will come to conduct the census are claimed to come at night, a situation that will still make the residents fearful to giving cooperation to the census clerks.
<15>	Mmoja wa akina mama hao aliyejitambulisha kwa jina la Anna Nakamanga alisema kuwa askari walivamia nyumbani nyakati za usiku na kuwatoa nje wakiwa uchi kisha kuwatandika viboko na kusema kuwa kitendo hicho ni udhalilishaji mkubwa uliofanywa na askari polisi kwa raia wasio na hatia.	one of the women, who identified herself as Anna Nakamanga, said that the police attacked her home at night and took them outside when they were naked and then flogged them. they said that the act done by the police to innocent residents is extremely demeaning.
<16>	Naye kiongozi wa Kanisa la Pentekostal la kijijini hapo aliyejitambulisha kwa jina la Mchungaji Nsokolo alisema kuwa matatizo yaliyopo kijijini hapo yamesababishwa na mauaji ya kinyama yaliyofanywa na mfanyabiashara huyo ambaye pamoja na kupatikana kwa vidhibiti juu ya mauaji aliyoyafanya jeshi la polisi limemuachia huru bila kumchukulia hatua za kisheria.	and the Pentecostal church leader in the village, who identified himself as Pastor Nsokolo, said that the problems in the village have been caused by the brutal murders that were committed by the businessman who, as well as being found with evidence of the murders he committed, has been left free by the police force, without any legal action taken.
<17>	Akizungumzia tukio hilo kwa njia ya simu kamanda wa polisi mkoani Mbeya Diwani Athuman alisema kuwa alifikishiwa taarifa za wizi na uharibifu wa mali na mmoja wa wafanyabiashara wa eneo hilo ambapo alichokifanya ni kuamuru wahusika wakamatwe kwa kuwa walifanya kosa na kwamba hakuna taarifa zilizofika kwake zinazohusu mauaji dhidi ya wananchi kwa imani za ushirikina.	speaking about the incident via the phone, police commander in Mbeya province, Diwani Athuman, said that he was given a report of theft and destruction of property by one of the businessmen from the region, and he ordered that the perpetrators be arrested and said that they made a mistake, and that there are no reports that have reached him about killing residents because of superstitious beliefs.
<18>	Aidha taarifa za awali zilidai kuwa mara baada ya mfanyabiashara huyo kukutwa na vidhibiti vya nguo zenye damu na silaha zinazodaiwa kutumika katika kutekeleza mauaji hayo aliachiliwa huru kwa kile kilichoelezwa kuwa aliwahonga fedha baadhi ya viongozi wa polisi wa wilaya ili kuficha ukweli wa tukio hilo.	moreover, earlier reports claimed that soon after the businessman was found with the evidence of bloody clothing and the weapons claimed to have been used to carry out the killing, he was set free for what was explained as bribery, giving cash to some of the district's police to cover the facts of the incident.
