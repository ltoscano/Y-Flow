<4>	KATIKA siku za hivi karibuni Wilaya ya Mkuranga mkoani Pwani, imepata umaarufu kutokana matukio ya kihalifu, ambapo tumeshuhudia na kusikia matukio mengi ya kutisha ya kihalifu yakitokea kwenye eneo hilo.	in recent days, Mkuranga in the province of Pwani has gotten a reputation as a result of criminal incidents, and we have witnessed and heard of many horrifying criminal incidents happening in the area.
<5>	Matukio yanayotokea huko si ya kitoto, ni yale yanayohusisha silaha za moto ambapo wahalifu waliopo humo inaonekana ni wale wenye ujuzi wa mbinu za kijeshi na kuua kwao ni jambo dogo.	the incidents happening there are no child's play; they involve fiery weapons and criminals who appear to have expertise in military strategies and to whom killing is a minor thing.
<6>	Juzi tu, Jeshi la Polisi lilitoa taarifa za kujibizana kwa risasi na watu wanaosadikiwa kuwa majambazi waliokuwa kwenye nyumba moja ambayo imezungushiwa ukuta, lakini watu wake wanakaa ndani na hawajichanganyi na wakazi wa eneo hilo.	just the other day, the military police reported an exchange of fire with people believed to be criminals who lived in a fenced house, but stayed indoors and didn't mix with the residents of the area.
<7>	Katika tukio hilo, majambazi wanne waliuawa na polisi mmoja alijeruhiwa, huku silaha kadhaa zikikamatwa ikiwemo bunduki yenye namba MV.	in that incident, four criminals were killed and one police officer injured, with several weapons captured, including a gun number MV.
<8>	51516 R na risasi tano ndani ya magazini yake.	51516R and five bullets were found inside its magazine.
<9>	Risasi nyingine sita za bunduki zilikutwa ndani ya mfuko wa plastiki pamoja na risasi nane za bastola.	six more gun bullets were found inside a plastic bag together with four other rifle bullets.
<10>	Mbali na tukio hilo, pia kulisharipotiwa matukio kama hayo ya majambazi kurushiana risasi na polisi katika eneo la Vikindu huko Mkuranga na wahalifu hao ikaelezwa walikuwa wakijifungia kwenye nyumba isiyoisha yaani pagala na hawajichanganyi na majirani.	apart from this incident, there have also been reports of criminals exchanging gun fire with police in Vikindu, Mkuranga have also been reported, with the criminals locking themselves inside empty half-finished houses and not mixing with neighbors.
<11>	Mkuranga hiyohiyo kuliripotiwa kuuawa kwa polisi mmoja na wengine wawili kujeruhiwa katika kituo cha Polisi cha Mkamba na watu wanaodhaniwa kuwa majambazi na kupora bunduki tano na risasi 30.	in the same Mkuranga area, one police officer was reported to be killed and two others injured at the Mkamba Police Station by people thought to be criminals, who also stole five guns and 30 bullets.
<12>	Kukaripotiwa pia kuuawa kwa askari wa Jeshi la Polisi Kikosi cha Usalama Barabarani, Sajini Ally Salum maarufu Kinyogori, kwa kupigwa risasi na watu wasiojulikana nyumbani kwake Mkuranga.	it was also reported that the the military police officer, Sergeant Ally Salum (famous as Kinyogori of the road safety), was shot and killed by unknown people in his home in Mkuranga. 
<13>	Mkuranga hiyo pia, aliyekuwa askari magereza wa Gereza la Dondwe, Juma Rashid alitumika kuchora ramani yote ya uvamizi na mauaji ya askari wa Kituo cha Polisi Stakishari, Dar es Salaam.	in Mkuranga, the former Dondwe Prison's officer, Juma Rashid, was used to draw the map to attack and kill police in the Stakishari Police Station, Dar es Salaam.
<14>	Hata hivyo baadaye aliuawa.	however, he was later killed.
<15>	Mauaji mengine yakaripotiwa tena ya askari mmoja na wengine wawili kuuawa na baadaye majambazi kupora bunduki na mamilioni ya fedha kwenye Benki ya NMB, tawi la Mkuranga.	there were also reports of criminals killing a police officer and two others and then robbing guns and money worth millions from the Mkuranga branch of the NMB Bank. 
<16>	Matukio hayo ya kiuhalifu ya kuhusisha mauaji ya kutumia silaha yameonekana ni kitu cha kawaida wilayani Mkuranga, hali inayotufanya tulisihi Jeshi la Polisi kuiangalia wilaya ya Mkuranga kwa jicho la pekee.	as these criminal incidents involving people being killed by weapons appear to be a normal thing in Mkuranga District, we are pleading with the military police to investigate the Mkuranga District in a unique way.
<17>	Wilayani humo kunaonekana ndiyo maficho ya wahalifu iwe kwenye misitu, porini na hata kwenye nyumba hasa mapagala, hivyo Jeshi la Polisi lisichukulie mzaha bali liongeze nguvu na kufanya operesheni za mfululizo kwenye wilaya hiyo.	given that the forests, bushes and houses (especially incomplete ones) of the district seems to be the hideout of the criminals, the military police should not take this lightly but should instead increase their efforts and conduct continuous operations in that district.
<18>	Tunajua Polisi wanajitahidi kupambana na uhalifu, lakini tunaamini bado juhudi na nguvu zinahitajika kuongezwa kwani wahalifu hawa wanavyozidi kupata nafasi ya kujiimarisha ndivyo jamii inaumia zaidi.	we know that the police are working hard to fight crime, but we believe they should increase their efforts, because the more the criminals get a chance to stabilize themselves, the more the community suffers.
<19>	Ni vema pia wananchi wakapewa elimu ya kutosha kubaini wahalifu pamoja na kuchunguzana wenyewe kwa wenyewe na pale wanapopata mashaka na majirani zao kuwa wepesi kutoa taarifa za siri polisi.	it is good for citizens to learn how to identify criminals, investigate others, and quickly and discreetly report to the police whenever they have any doubts about their neighbors.
<20>	Wahalifu tunaishi nao na kwa sasa imeonekana wanatumia mbinu za kuishi nje ya mji kwani huwa hakuna mwingiliano, hivyo nyendo zao zinaweza zisifahamike lakini wananchi wakishirikiana na polisi ni rahisi kuwabaini na kuwaondoa wahalifu hao.	we live with the criminals, and for now, it appears they are living outside the town where their activities usually remain unknown and can be conducted without interference, but if the citizens cooperate with police it is easy to find and remove these criminals.
<21>	Sasa hivi hali imekuwa mbaya zaidi, wahalifu wanathubutu kuingia hadi kwenye nyumba za ibada na kujifanya waumini wazuri kumbe wanatumika kama kichaka cha kufanya uhalifu wao, hivyo maeneo hayo nako tusioneane aibu na kila mtu awe mpelelezi wa mwenzake kujua shughuli anayofanya na nyendo zake kiujumla.	at the moment, the situation is worse as criminals dare to enter houses of worship and pretend to be good believers as a way to hide their crimes, so we should not be ashamed to monitor others and their behavior in these spaces.
<22>	Haiwezekani mtaani kwako watu wanaishi kwenye nyumba ambako hawaonekani kutoka kwenda kwenye shughuli ya kuwaingizia kipato nawe jirani hujiulizi huyu mtu anapata wapi mlo wake na familia yake.	it is impossible that there are people who live in a house in your street and are not seen going out to earn income, and you as a neighbor don't ask yourself how that person gets a meal for himself and his family.
<23>	Tunaamini Jeshi la Polisi likijipanga vizuri kwa kushirkiana na wananchi wahalifu hawa wanaoitia doa nchi yetu wataondolewa.	we believe if the military police plans well by cooperating with citizens, these criminals tarnishing our country will be eliminated.
