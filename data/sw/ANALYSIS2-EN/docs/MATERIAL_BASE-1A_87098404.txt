<1>	MWANAMKE ALIYE PANGA NJAMA ZA KUMUUA MUMEWE ILI AFAIDI MALI ZAKE AENDELEA KUSOTA RUMANDE	a woman who had made plans to kill her husband so she could benefit from his assets continues to suffer in remand.
<2>	MAHAKAMA Kuu Kanda ya Arusha jana imekataa ombi la hati ya dharura ya dhamana ya mke wa mfanyabiashara maarufu wa madini mkoani Arusha, Janeth Jackson (32), anayedaiwa kupanga njama za kumuua mumewe wa ndoa.	the Arusha Regional High Court yesterday refused an emergency plea for bail by the wife of the famous mining businessman in Arusha Province, Janeth Jackson (32), who is alleged to have made plans to kill her husband.
<3>	Janeth na mshitakiwa wa pili, Novatus Elias kupitia Wakili wao, Samsoni Rumende waliwasilisha hati hiyo katika Mahakama Kuu, kuomba dhamana baada ya mahakama ya wilaya ya Arusha iliyoko Sekei, kuwanyima dhamana.	Janeth, as well as the second accused, Novatus Elias, submitted a certificate to the High Court through their lawyer, Samson Rumende, to request for release on bail after the Arusha District Court in Sekei denied them bail.
<4>	Mahakama iliwanyima dhamana washitakiwa hao, kwa maelezo kuwa kufanya hivyo ni kuharibu kesi, kwani kuna watuhumiwa wengine hawajakamatwa.	the court denied the accused bail, explaining that doing so would spoil the case because there are other suspects who have not been arrested.
<5>	Hata hivyo, Jaji Mary Moshi alikataa kumjumuisha mshitakiwa wa pili katika hati hiyo, kwa maelezo kuwa wakili hakumjumuisha katika hati.	however, Judge Mary Moshi refused to include the second accused in the certificate, explaining that the lawyer did not include him in the request.
<6>	‘’Katika hati ya dharura, naona jina la mshitakiwa wa kwanza tu ndiye anayeombewa dhamana, lakini jina la mshitakiwa wa pili, Elias, haliko hivyo siwezi kusikiliza kwa kuwa ni kinyume na utaratibu,’’ alisema Jaji Moshi.	"in the emergency plea, I see the name of the first accused only in the request for bail, but the name of the second accused, Elias, is not there, and I cannot therefore listen to it because it is against the procedures," said Judge Moshi.
<7>	Pamoja na hayo, Jaji Moshi alimnyima dhamana Janeth kwa maelezo kuwa Wakili Rumende amefanya makosa ya kisheria, kwani alipaswa kukata rufaa kupinga uamuzi wa Mahakama ya wilaya wa kumnyima dhamana mteja wake.	Judge Moshi also denied Janeth bail, explaining that lawyer Rumende had conducted a legal offense, because he was meant to appeal against the decision of the district court to deny his client bail.
<8>	Alisema kuomba hati ya dharura ya kuomba dhamana, sio utaratibu wa kisheria na kutokana na hali hiyo, alimtaka wakili huyo kwenda kujipanga upya .	she said that requesting a certificate of emergency plea for bail is not a legal procedure and because of that situation, she wanted the lawyer to make a new plan.
<9>	Awali akizungumza mahakamani hapo, Rumende alimwomba Jaji Moshi kumpa dhamana mteja wake, kwani ana mtoto mchanga wa miezi mitano.	earlier while speaking at the court, Rumende asked Judge Moshi to give his client bail, because she has a young five-month-old child.
<10>	Rumende alidai kuwa dhamana ni haki ya msingi ya mteja wake na hawezi kuathiri mwenendo wa kesi na atatii masharti ya dhamana kwa jamii, inayomzunguka bila ya wasiwasi wowote.	Rumende claimed that bail is a basic right of his client and she could not affect the trend of the case and she would abide by the instructions of the bail to the community surrounding her without any concern.
<11>	Hoja hizo zilipingwa vikali na Wakili wa Serikali, Edana Kasala aliyedai kuwa utaratibu umekiukwa na pili mahakama ya wilaya iko sahihi kuwanyima dhamana washitakiwa hao.	these points were opposed vehemently by the government's lawyer Edana Kasala, who claimed that the procedure was violated and secondly that the district court was right in denying the accused bail.
<12>	Janeth ambaye ni mkazi wa Moshono, jijini Arusha pamoja na Novatus Elias, katika kesi hiyo katika mahakama ya wilaya, wanashitakiwa kwa kula njama ya kutaka kumwua Jackson Manjuru ambaye ni mume wa Janeth.	Janeth, who is a resident of Moshono in Arusha city, and Novatus Elias, are accused in this case in the district court of plotting to kill Jackson Manjuru, who is Janeth's husband.
<13>	Washitakiwa wote wawili pia wanadaiwa kutenda kosa la kula njama na kutaka kumwua Desderi Sabas, anayeishi Bukoba mkoani Kagera, ambaye ni mtoto wa nje wa mume huyo.	both the accused are also alleged to have committed the offense of plotting to kill Desderi Sabas, who lives in Bukoba Province, Kagera, and is a child sired out of wedlock by the husband.
<14>	Washitakiwa wote hawakutakiwa kujibu lolote mahakamani hapo, kwa sababu Mahakama hiyo kisheria haina mamlaka ya kusikiliza kesi za mauaji.	neither of the accused were required to respond to anything in court, because the court legally does not have the authority to hear murder cases.
