<1>	“Bado Yanga ina nafasi ya kutetea ubingwa”- Cannavaro	"Yanga still has a chance to defend the title" - Cannavaro
<2>	Nahodha wa Yanga, Nadir Haroub ‘Cannavaro’ amewataka mashabiki wa klabu hiyo kuendelea kuwasapoti kwa kwenda viwanjani katika michezo yao na kuwashangilia kwani bado wana matumaini ya kutwaa ubingwa wa Ligi Kuu ya Vodacom 2016/2017.	"Yanga captain Nadir Haroub 'Cannavaro' has asked club fans to continue supporting them by going to the stadiums for their games and cheering them on since they have hopes of clinching the Vodacom Premier League title for 2016/2017."
<3>	Cannavaro aliyasema hayo baada ya kumalizika kwa mchezo wa VPL kati ya Yanga na Mtibwa ambao ulimalizika kwa sare ya bila kufungana na kuongeza kuwa bado wana michezo mingi hivyo wakitumia michezo hiyo vyema wanaweza kutetea ubingwa wa VPL kwa mara nyingine.	Cannavaro said this after the end of the VPL match between Yanga and Mtibwa which ended in a barren draw and added that they still have many games and so if they play the games well they can defend the VPL title for another year.
<4>	“Niwapongeze Mtibwa wamecheza vizuri hata timu yangu imecheza vizuri pia, tumetengeza nafasi nyingi, tumepata penati lakini hatukufanikiwa kupata goli, bado tunaendelea na mapambano, tuna michezo mingi ya nyumbani na tuna nafasi ya kutetea ubingwa,	"let me praise Mtibwa they have played well and my team has played well too, we have created many opportunities, we got a penalty but we did not manage to get a goal, we are continuing this battle, we have many games at home and we have a chance of defending the title,
<5>	Yanga ina kikosi kikubwa ambacho kinawachezaji wengi wenye uwezo, haimtegemei mtu na hata vijana wanapewa nafasi … bado tuna nafasi mechi sita ni nyingi sana, kwangu bado nafasi ipo ya kutetea ubingwa,” alisema Cannavaro.	Yanga has a big team which has many capable players, it does not depend on anyone and even the youths are given a chance... we still have a chance, six games are a lot and, to me, the chance to defend the title is still there," said Cannavaro.
