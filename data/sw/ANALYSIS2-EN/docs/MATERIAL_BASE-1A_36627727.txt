<4>	ZAIDI ya kampuni 35,000 ziko hatarini kufutiwa leseni na wahusika kufikishwa mahakamani kwa kutofuata sheria za uendeshaji biashara nchini.	the licenses of more than 35,000 companies risk being revoked and the parties arraigned in court for noncompliance with the country's business operation laws.
<5>	Mtendaji Mkuu wa Wakala wa Usajili wa Leseni na Biashara (BRELA), Frank Kanyusi, amesema jana mjini Mwanza baada ya miezi mitatu kuanzia sasa kampuni hizo zitaanza kufutwa.	the Chief Executive Officer of the Business Registration and Licensing Agency (BRELA), Frank Kanyusi, said yesterday at Mwanza town that three months from now, these companies will be abolished.
<6>	"Tunatoa miezi mitatu kuanzia sasa kwa wamiliki wa kampuni kuhakikisha wanakamilisha taratibu za uendeshaji wa kampuni zao," amesema.	"we are giving the company owners three months from now to ensure that they comply with procedures of operating their companies," he said.
<7>	Ametoa mwito kwa wanaoziendesha kuwasilisha taarifa za kampuni zao kila mwaka pamoja na nakala ya mkaguzi wa fedha, na kwamba kutofanya hivyo kusababisha kufungwa kwa kampuni na kufikishwa mahakamani kwa kukiuka sheria.	he has requested those operating the businesses to present the reports of their companies every year, together with the financial auditor's report. failure to do so will cause the company to be closed down and arraigned in court for noncompliance with the law.
<8>	"Zaidi ya kampuni 35, 000 zitafutwa na kufunguliwa kesi kwa kutotii sheria na kanuni za uwasilishaji wa taarifa za kampuni kila mwaka," Kanyusi aliwaeleza waandishi wa habari wakati wa usajili wa majina ya biashara na kampuni mkoani hapa.	"over 35,000 companies will be revoked and a case opened against them for noncompliance to the rules and regulations on presenting the company's reports every year," Kanyusi told the press during the registration of business and company names in the district.
<9>	Amewataka wafanyabiashara na wajasiriamali nchini kutumia fursa ya uwepo wake kurasimisha biashara zao ili serikali iwatambue na kutoa ushirikiano katika kufanya biashara.	he has requested that traders and entrepreneurs in the country utilize his availability to ratify their businesses so that the government recognizes them and offers cooperation in their business ventures.
<10>	Kwa mujibu wake, mwitikio wa watu katika zoezi hilo ni mkubwa kwani wameweza kusajili majina ya biashara 150 na kampuni 100 kwa siku sita kutokana na semina elekezi iliyotolewa kuhusu umuhimu wa kurasimisha biashara.	according to him, the people's response to the exercise has been huge, since they have managed to register the names of 150 businesses and 100 companies in six days, following an awareness seminar that was given about the importance of formalizing business.
<11>	Alisema wakala unatambua changamoto iliyopo ya upatikanaji wa elimu ya huduma wanazotoa na ndio sababu wameanza ziara ya kutembea mikoa kwa lengo la kutoa elimu kwa wananchi juu ya huduma za Brela na umuhimu wa kurasimisha biashara.	he said that the agency knows the challenges of getting information on the services they offer, and that is why they have started a mission of touring districts with the goal of providing education to residents concerning Brela services and the importance of formalizing business.
<12>	Alifafanua kwa sasa vyombo vya fedha vinaweza kupata taarifa za uhalali wa biashara ya mteja anayetaka kufungua akaunti kupitia mtandao wa Brela.	he explained that for now, financial systems can get legitimate business information about a customer who wants to open an account through the network of Brela.
<13>	"Hii itasaidia kuboresha mazingira ya biashara nchini kwani itampa nafuu mteja muda wa kufanya shughuli nyingine za maendeleo," alisema Kanyusi.	"this will help improve the business environment in the country, since it will save the customer's time, which can be spent on undertaking other development activities," said Kanyusi.
<14>	Alisisitiza kuwa Brela itazindua mfumo wa usajili wa kampuni Machi mwakani ambao utahusisha taasisi nyingine za serikali kama Mamlaka ya Mapato (TRA) ili kurahisisha urasimishaji wa kampuni, ikiwa ni jitihada za kuweka mazingira bora ya biashara nchini.	he insisted that Brela will unveil the company registration system in March this year, which will involve other governmental organizations like Revenue Authority (TRA), in order to simplify the company registration, in an effort to develop better business environment in the country.
<15>	Alifafanua kuwa mteja atakapowasilisha maombi ya kufungua kampuni, mfumo utamuunganisha na TRA kupata namba ya utambulisho wa mlipa kodi (TIN) kwa muda mfupi na mteja atakuwa amekamilisha taratibu na kuendelea na biashara.	he explained that when a customer presents a request to open a company, the system will connect him with TRA to get a tax payer identification number (TIN) within a short time, and the customer will have completed the procedure and continue with business.
<16>	Mmoja wa wajasiriamali aliyejitokeza, Gerald Malamba aliwataka wajasiriamali wenzake kurasimisha biashara zao ili kutengeneza mazingira mazuri ya kufanya biashara na pia serikali kuweza kutambua walipa kodi wake.	one of the entrepreneurs who showed up, Gerald Malamba, wanted his fellow entrepreneurs to make their businesses official to cultivate a good business environment, and also for the government to be able to recognize its taxpayers.
<17>	Mjasiriamali, Anitha Samson alisema ni faraja kwake kwa Brela kufika Mwanza kwani wamepata elimu juu ya umuhimu wa kurasimisha biashara na kutoa mwito kwa wakala kufungua ofisi za kanda ili kutoa huduma kwa ufanishi zaidi.	entrepreneur Anitha Samson said it's a joy to her for Brela to reach Mwanza, since they have received an education on the importance of formalizing business, and she appealed to agents to open regional offices in order to provide services with more success.
