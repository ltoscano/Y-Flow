<3>	UAMUZI wa Kamati Kuu ya Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM) wa kuazimia kutwaa viwanda vilivyouzwa ama kubinafsishwa kwa baadhi ya wafanyabiashara ambao wameshindwa kumudu masharti ya mkataba, kwa mara ya kwanza, utawanasa baadhi ya makada waandamizi wa chama hicho, Raia Mwema linaripoti.	the decision from the executive committee of revolutionary party (CCM), intending to take over factories that had been privatized or sold to some businessmen who have failed to maintain the terms of the contract, will, for the first time, catch some of the senior cadres of the party, Raia Mwema reports.
<4>	Kwa mujibu wa taarifa rasmi ambazo gazeti hili limezipata, uamuzi huo moja kwa moja unaathiri baadhi ya makada waandamizi wa CCM ambao ni pamoja na aliyepata kuwa Mbunge wa Igunga na Mweka Hazina (taifa) wa zamani wa CCM, ambaye pia ni Mfanyabiashara maarufu, Rostam Aziz sambamba na Mbunge wa sasa wa Morogoro Mjini, Aboud Azizi.	according to official reports received by this newspaper, the decision directly affects some of the senior members of CCM including the former Igunga member of parliament and former CCM treasurer (national), who is also a famous businessman, Rostam Aziz, alongside Morogoro member of parliament, Aboud Azizi.
<5>	Wengine ni pamoja na Mbunge wa zamani wa Bukoba Vijijini kupitia Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM), Nazir Karamagi na mmoja wa vigogo waandamizi katika Awamu ya Tatu iliyokuwa ikiongozwa na Rais Benjamin Mkapa, Nsa Kaisi.	others include the former Bukoba member of parliament of CCM, Nazir Karamagi, and one of the bigwig successors in the third term of president Benjamin Mkapa, Nsa Kaisi.
<6>	Kwa wakati tofauti, makada hao na wengine wamepata kubinafsishwa viwanda na kushindwa kukidhi matakwa ya baadhi ya mikataba kati ya viwanda walivyobinafsishiwa.	at various times, those members and others have privatized factories and failed to fulfill the demands of some contracts in some of the privatized factories.
<7>	Viwanda hivyo ni pamoja na vya korosho katika mikoa ya kusini na vingine katika maeneo mbaimbali nchini, ikiwamo mkoani Morogoro.	the factories include cashew nuts in the southern province and others in different regions of the country, including the Morogoro district.
<8>	“Kuna baadhi ya wafanyabiashara ambao walipewa viwanda kwa mikataba ya ama mauziano au uendeshaji tu.	"there are some businessmen who were given factories on contracts of either sale or just running.
<9>	Mikataba hii ilikuwa na masharti kadhaa ikiwa ni pamoja na kuendeleza uzalishaji wa kiwanda husika kama awali, kwa bahati mbaya, wamegeuza baadhi ya viwanda walivyotwaa kuwa maghala au kwingine wanaendesha shughuli zao tofauti na matakwa ya mikataba ya ubinafsishaji,” kinaeleza chanzo chetu cha habari.	these contracts had several rules including the continuation of production in the respective industry like before, unfortunately, they have converted the factories they took to be warehouses or elsewhere, they have run their own businesses different from the requirements of the privatization contracts," explains our source of information.
<10>	Kwa mfano, katika Mkoa wa Morogoro, viwanda ambavyo vilibinafsishwa na ambavyo bado vinaendelea kufanya kazi ni pamoja na Tanzania Packaging Manufactures (1998 Ltd) kinachotengeneza magunia; kiwanda cha Tanzania Tobacco Processor kinachochakata tumbaku; Pollytex (21st Century Textile Mills 1998 Ltd) kinachotengeneza nguo na kiwanda cha Morogoro Tanneries (Ace Hides Ltd), kinachotengeneza ngozi.	for example, in the Morogoro district, factories that were privatized and are still working include Tanzania Packaging Manufacturers (1998 Limited) that makes bags, Tanzania tobacco processor that processes tobacco, Pollytex (21st Century Textile Mills 1998 Limited) that makes clothes and Morogoro Tanneries (Ace Hides Limited) that makes leather.
<11>	Viwanda vingine ni Mtibwa Sugar Estate (1998) Ltd kinachozalisha sukari, Kilombero Sugar Company – ILLOVO (K1) kinachozalisha sukari; Kilombero Plantation Ltd (KPL) kinachohusika na uzalishaji mchele na Kilombero Sugar Company – ILLOVO (K2) kinachozalisha sukari.	other factories are Mtibwa Sugar Estate (1998) Limited that produces sugar, Kilombero Sugar Company - ILLOVO (K1) that produces sugar, Kilombero Plantation Limited (KPL) that is associated with rice production with the Kilombero Sugar Company - Illovo (K2) that produces sugar.
<12>	Lakini kwa upande wa viwanda visivyoendelea na uzalishaji licha ya ubinafsishaji ambao kwa wakati huo ulikuwa ukisimamia na aliyekuwa Waziri wa Ubinafishaji Dk.	however, for the factories that do not continue its production despite privatization which, at the time, was headed by former privatization minister Doctor
<13>	Abdallah Kigoda ambaye ndiye Waziri wa sasa wa Viwanda na Biashara ni pamoja na Morogoro Ceramic Wares Ltd, Tanzania Leather Goods Industry, Kilosa Carpets Ltd, Moro Shoes Ltd (G & T Shoe Company), Moproco na kiwanda maarufu cha Morogoro Canvas Mills (1998) Ltd, kilichokuwa kikitengeneza maturubai.

<14>	Kutokuendelea kufanya kazi kwa viwanda hivyo kumesababisha changamoto kadhaa ambazo ni pamoja na ukosefu wa ajira, hasa kwa vijana mkoani Morogoro, pigo ambalo linazidi kukiadhibu chama tawala, CCM miongoni mwa makundi ya vijana.	discontinuation of work in the factories has caused several challenges including unemployment, particularly to the youths in the Morogoro province, a blow that continues to punish the ruling party, CCM, among youth groups.
<15>	Kwa sasa taarifa kuhusu hali ya viwanda nchini inabainisha ya kwamba kwa mwaka 2008, idadi ya viwanda vilivyokuwa vinafanyakazi kwa upande wa Tanzania Bara ni 729.	right now, news about the state of factories in the country ascertains that in the year of 2008, the number of factories that were working in the Tanzania mainland was 729.
<16>	Kati ya idadi hiyo ya viwanda, vilivyokuwa katika Jiji la Dar es Salaam ni 383; Arusha 51, Mwanza 39, Singida 27, Tanga 27, Kagera 26 na Kilimanjaro 24.	among that number of factories, those in Dar es Salaam was 383, Arusha 51, Mwanza 39, Singida 27, Tanga 27, Kagera 26 and Kilimanjaro 24.
<17>	Kati ya viwanda hivyo vilivyokuwapo mwaka 2008, viwanda 643 vinatajwa kumilikiwa na watu binafsi na viwanda 72 vikimilikiwa na serikali wakati vilivyobaki 14, vinamilikiwa kwa pamoja kati ya serikali na sekta binafsi.	among the factories that were there in 2008, 643 factories are mentioned to have been owned by private people and 72 factories by the government while the other 14 are owned jointly between the government and the private sector.
<18>	Kwa mujibu wa takwimu hizo za viwanda kutoka serikalini, viwanda 549 vinamilikiwa kwa asilimia 100 na wazawa wakati 121 vinamilikiwa na wageni kutoka nje ya nchi.	according to the statistics of the factories from the government, 549 factories are 100 percent owned by locals while 121 are owned by visitors from outside the country.
<19>	Vingine vipatavyo 59 vinamilikiwa kwa ubia kati ya serikali na watu binafsi au kati ya wageni na wazawa.	almost 59 others are owned in partnership between the government and private people or between visitors and locals.
<20>	Inaelezwa ya kwamba kati ya viwanda 729 vilivyokuwapo mwaka 2008, asilimia 93 au viwanda 680 ni viwanda vya uzalishaji bidhaa, kati ya hivyo asilimia 93, yaani viwanda 240 vinajihusisha na uzalishaji bidhaa za chakula,vinywaji pamoja na tumbaku na mashine za kusaga nafaka 61.	it is explained that among 729 factories that were there in the year 2008, 93 percent or 680 factories are factories that produce goods. of that, 93 percent, meaning 240 factories, are factories that produce food or drinks along with tobacco and grain milling machines.
<21>	Uchunguzi zaidi wa gazeti hili unabainisha ya kwamba licha ya kuwapo kwa viwanda hivyo nchini sehemu kubwa ya bidhaa zinazozalishwa na baadhi ya viwanda hivyo bado zinaagizwa kutoka nje ya nchi, hali inayotia shaka kuhusu uratibu wa Wizara ya Viwanda na Biashara, inayoongozwa na Mbunge wa Handeni, Waziri Dk. Abdallah Kigoda ambaye hata hivyo, hadi tunakwenda mitambano hakuweza kupatikana, simu yake ya mkononi ikiita bila kujibiwa.	more investigation by this newspaper shows that despite there being these industries in the country, a large portion of the products from some of these industries are still imported, something that brings fear about the organization of the ministry of industries and business, led by Handeni member of parliament, minister Doctor Abdallah Kigoda, who was not available even through the internet, with his cell phone ringing and going unanswered.
