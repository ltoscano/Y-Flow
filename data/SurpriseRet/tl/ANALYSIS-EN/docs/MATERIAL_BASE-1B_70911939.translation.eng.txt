many has taken notice how the sweet gestures of Alden Richards and Maine Mendoza are for cinematic purposes only in Destined To Be Yours.
it has a huge effect for viewers.
it was obvious how the actor has no feelings of love for Maine.
many advised the young lady to open up her eyes and find someone who would truly love her.
sometimes it is hard to believe someone super handsome like Alden would love the young lady.
to give an example is the relationship between Erich Gonzales and Daniel Matsunaga, did it not also end in separation?
the couple's love affair did not last.
in the television series of Alden and Maine, television viewers mentioned how they have already seen the wood chopping and water fetching of Alden.
the scene they have watched was unrealistic.
and how could they say that the scene was shot set during the old times when hair of the mother is dyed red, as played by Janice de Belen.
it is a symbol of modern times.
