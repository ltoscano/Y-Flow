an official of Malacañang denied they were connected to the arrested Lieutenant Colonel Ferdinand Marcelino.
the Palace made the announcement in the midst of news that Marcelino is connected to the office led by Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa.
according to Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) executive director Reginald Villasanta, their office has no ongoing operation together with Marcelino.
Villasanta even insisted, the apprehended official of the Philippine Marines has never been an operative of their office.
the information started after PDEA director general Dionisio Santiago said that Marcelino directly reports to Ochoa.
supposedly there were instances too when Marcelino himself gave briefings of his operations to President Benigno Aquino III.
despite this Santiago said that up to now he does not know if Marcelino is still connected to the office of Ochoa.
Marcelino was apprehended yesterday inside a clandestine shabu den by the members of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) and Philippine National Police (PNP) in Sta. Cruz, Manila.
Marcelino earlier said that he was in the area where the PDEA operated to gather information.
according to him, he supposedly can prove that his mission in the area was legitimate.
earlier Marcelino was placed under inquest proceeding in the Department of Justice together with a Chinese he was with when he was apprehended.
they were charged with violation of RA 9165 or violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. -DCR
