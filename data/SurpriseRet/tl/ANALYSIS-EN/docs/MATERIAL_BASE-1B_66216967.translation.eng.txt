never ending grief
the rainbow is not going to surface without clouds and storm.
whenever you'll notice yourself lonesome in grief, this is a sign of emotional failure.
the conscience is being oppressed with the mistakes done without forgiveness, dreams which have been postponed that can no longer be finished, and sentences which can no longer be uttered.
if an ordinary mistake comes with a tear, grief has a pitiable wail.
while still just by your side, this is being neglected; but if gone and left, this is being remembered and will never be forgotten.
a thing that you have not loved and neglected, you will be left behind.
if you are consciously lazy to think, no zeal and slow in making change, has cowardice in accepting the truth, you cannot achieve the poetry and happiness that you are anticipating in any time.
we have two ears and a mouth; evidence that we need to listen carefully and speak slightly.
in a peaceful home, a croak not cackle reigns.
animals have abilities which are better than us - they do not know paradise and hell.
whatever you tell them, they do not have care and time to be serious and take these things personally.
and when they are delighted and very happy, they are moving their tails and not tongues to make a fool out of your head.
a way for you to love more is to accept the truth that everything is only transient, and at any moment this is going to end.
life has no certainty, if you are not going to give importance to it, this will leave you full of regret and grief.
in getting married, choose the woman you are going to marry as a close friend as if she has been a male.
because if your spouse is good, your life together is exemplary.
and if your spouse is evil and a nagger, you are going to be a philosopher of life.
usual pleasure brings happiness.
usual sorrow brings grief.
