Josephine Medina is also qualified to receive P1 million, after winning the bronze medal in Class 8 table tennis in Rio 2016 Paralympic Games, according to Senator Juan Edgardo Angara.
the Senator explained that the cash incentive is not just for those who win medals in Summer Olympics, but also for the Paralympic Games, a contest for the disabled.
"this is truly one of the noblest intentions of the law - to include our winning athletes with disabilities in the grant of cash awards from the government."
the term 'national athletes' should encompass all athletes including those who are differently-abled, as they undoubtedly deserve bigger incentives and benefits," said Angara, author and sponsor of Republic Act 10699.
Medina, 46-year-old flag bearer of the country in Games, is the second to win the Paralympic medal for the Philippines, after powerlifter, Adeline Dumapong who won bronze last 2000 in Sydney.
but RA 10699 was not yet implemented before, Dumapong Ancheta only received token incentives worth P200, 000 from the Philippine Sports Commission and P300,000 from President Joseph Estrada.
under the new law, winner of gold in the Paralympics will be given P5 million, P2.5 million for silver, and P1 million for bronze.
coach will also receive cash incentive worth half the amount the winner will receive.
last month, Rio Olympics silver medalist weightlifter, Hidilyn Diaz, received the equivalent amount,
