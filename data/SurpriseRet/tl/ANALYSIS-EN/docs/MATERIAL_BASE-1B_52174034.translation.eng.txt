carrying their babies more mothers went to health centers .
because it's national immunization day on Wednesday .
most of the mothers on queue are hoping there's Pentavalent vaccine already .
but they are dismayed in knowing that until now there is still no Pentavalent vaccine in health centers .
so Christy is worrying .
her baby is already seven months and until now this is still not vaccinated with Penta .
<foreign><foreign> there may be no Pentavalent vaccine but patiently waiting in line are the mothers .
instead of Pentavalent the baby is given pneumococcal vaccine .
<foreign> later we will still be back if there is Pentavalent .
explains the city health office because there is no Pentavalent they can temporarily give Pneumococcal vaccine to the infants .
they can be separate they can also be taken together .
meaning if we have sufficient P_C_V thirteen and pentavalent they can be given together .
one hundred infants are the target of every health center to get vaccinated with pentavalent vaccine every Wednesday .
but because there is a shortage of supply those who were vaccinated last week did not reach twenty .
the transition at the national headquarters of the department of health is one of the pinpointed reasons why their is a shortage in supply of Pentavalent vaccine .
do not be scared please or do not be worried that your children will not be provided with pentavalent .
definitely we are pursuing that they will not reach eleven months old without being given the vaccine .
meaning they still have -- we have still time to pursue them .
today came the supply of vaccine from D_O_H Manila .
this Friday the city health office will be taking supplies at the regional center of D_O_H .
that is why next week city health ensures that they can give pentavalent vaccine to infants .
