did you encounter a Ranger?
the Scout Rangers are widely known for their stealth, cunning and ferocity in combat.
the unit's mascot is the Black Panther (also referred to as the local Musang).
there are several records about the Rangers' accomplishments in military operations starting from the Huk campaign, the Muslim rebellion in the 1970's and the current operations against various threats.
due to their superb skills in small-unit operations, the Scout Rangers are able to capitalize on stealth movement and the element of surprise, making them the enemies' worst nightmare.
did you encounter a Ranger?
the line, "did you encounter a Ranger?"
got famous from drinking sessions and teasing among soldiers.
in the original idea, this refers to the enemy who lost in battle.
for example, after one success of the 4th Scout Ranger Company led by Sergeant Sabellina in Davao, this is what soldiers say to the NPA: "see, you won't surrender so you encountered a Ranger!"
this is also used by Rangers who are courting someone.
as Brigadier General Benjamin Duque (senior class 08) jokingly taught, Scout Rangers should show their musang patch when courting in order to gain the affection of their loved one right away.
if the girlfriend of a Scout Ranger is pretty, some, especially non-Rangers, say: "that one encountered a Ranger!"
once, this also became a reason for fighting among soldiers.
in one instance, there was a missing cellphone in the Army Shooting Team and it could not be determined who took it.
when there was an investigation, one soldier said: "sir, it looks like that cellphone was 'Rangered'!"
and because of what he said, one muscular Ranger angrily confronted him and said: "you brute! just because you're a non-Ranger what do you think of us Rangers? thieves?
let's just box!".
I was able to restrain them, though.
because of this, use the said terminology properly. otherwise, we might get "Ranger-ed".
