in his job interview in Wanted President of G_M_A News and Public Affairs Roxas will continue the things P_Noy started .
first of all job .
second is hope future .
we will ensure the next generation will be able to start in a more organized more beautiful level instead of what we have arrived at present .
and third all those support services .
and for these to be achieved .
let us lower the electric charges .
we will flourish the agriculture center through investments .
I will broaden this Four Ps Program of ours right support for each family right ?
in healthcare .
though there are successes already reached in traversing the Right Path there are still challenges that need to be overcame .
why are there still many left in dire poverty ?
you know in the lowest -- lowest rank of society .
with the gravity of the problem we can never finish all of that .
now we have reached far and we can even reach farther we still have many things to do .
the controversy caused by the encounter in Mamasapano .
the President mandated to coordinate .
<no-speech>
no coordination happened so in your question if I the President I will also mandate that .
Roxas was also stormed with criticism when the super typhoon Yolanda lashed out .
the response was slow and -- of help by the government .
that even came from ah at United -- at Rapporteur for the Human Rights right ?
but the Rapporteur also said that the government response was outstanding relative to the size of the problem .
even before Yolanda arrived I was already there to help in the preparation .
back when Yolanda came I was there I did not leave .
but despite the issues he said he can be proud of the more than twenty-two years of service in the government .
we reached this because our system is we are solving the problem and not only putting on a face or photo opportunity only .
you are pictured what is that you is you at the marketplace carrying sack of rice and many more .
which begs to question are those sincere ?
if sometimes we are there at the market the photographer tells you sir can you do this or how about this can you do it ?
but I can do it .
maybe -- it was only misinterpreted by the people .
there was nothing -- I was not pretending to be a porter of -- of sacks of rice right .
(()) already clear where my beginnings are .
