mirror of life
mirror of life
by Apolinario B Villalobos
a person cannot see his face unless he looks at a mirror.
he will be able to see his whole face only in that way, that he has dirt he needs to wipe in order to be removed... that he has a mole under his left eye... that he has uneven teeth... that he has a sweet smile, etc.
in our everyday life, we also need to have a "mirror" in order to know if we are doing something not good, vulgar, or kind.
in this occasion, our "mirror" is our fellowman.
through them we will see and know that we have done vulgar things so we can avoid repeating them.
through their actions we will also be able to see the kindness we have done, but are not aware of.
but using our fellowman as a mirror is effective only if we can accept our faults.
until we cannot do this, we are limited to giving compliments when we see our fellowmen doing something good and condemning them if they do something bad - that we have done as well.
because of that looking through a mirror via our fellowman is useless.
in instances where we should have learned something but let it pass, we have no one to blame but ourselves - if we are suffering because of frequent shortage of money, disobedient children, loss of work, separation of spouse, etc.
we may regret it... but it is too late.
