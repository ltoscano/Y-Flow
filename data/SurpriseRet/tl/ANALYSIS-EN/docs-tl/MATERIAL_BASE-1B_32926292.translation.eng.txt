George good afternoon to you .

<no-speech>
good afternoon Kirby at this time aside from the one hundred and seventeen that you mentioned is in total is one hundred and fifty one already including the first ones who were freed and those who were freed by way of the calibrated response of the joint force of A_F_P and of the Philippine National Police .
the one hundred and seventeen was -- just last night in the early -- one consecutive operations carried out by the authorities .
first of that is the minimum aerial strike that was carried out yesterday by the flight of the government's N_G_five twenty and three times -- raining on the groups of the Moro National Liberation Front Misuari faction .
meanwhile we're receiving a flash report now Kirby that aside from having or despite having released one hundred and seventeen hostages this morning until starting last night Zamboanga City Chief of Police Police Senior Superintendent Chiquito Malayo has been kidnapped .
Colonel Malayo was said to be abducted by a number of members of the M_N_L_F in the Arena Blanco area in Sitio Arena Blanco in Mampang Municipality here in Zamboanga City .
along with Colonel Malayo are three members of the Zamboanga City Police as well when -- they were abducted past eleven o'clock just a while ago .
they were carrying out -- and they were carrying out clearing operations A_F_P will say that almost seventy percent of their previously cleared areas that were first infested by these M_N_L_F members have been passed to the M_N_L -- or to -- passed to the P_N_P for clearing operations hopefully .
and you can see in the video some of the members of the Moro National Liberation Front who were killed in the conducted operation of the combined forces of A_F_P and the Philippine National Police .
these are currently still in the corner of Veteran Avenue .
and earlier this morning like what you can see in your video now the hostages are being retrieved one by one were the first freed in the part of Barrio Santa Barbara .
many of them are middle aged women and men and I also saw an almost nine children in ages thirteen below .
but what D_I_L_G Secretary Mar Roxas ensures is that they will undergo debriefing and and -- or to totally eliminate their trauma after eight days of being held hostages in the hands of M_N_L_F member Misuari faction .
with the initiative of D_S_W_D's Secretary Dinky Soliman who personally monitored the administration of debriefing sessions to the hostage victims they will lead the restoration of peace in these first hostages .
we even saw that one of them was almost crying when he saw his relative inside the bus at was brought here inside Camp Batalla or formerly known as Camp Cawa-Cawa here in Zamboanga City .
because the debriefing sessions for them are being held there .
and and also one of those whom I talked to which is Neri Lumen he is a father who lost a child after the M_N_L_F member the members shot his twenty year old child .
but fortunately according to him his wife and other -- child have escaped after the being captured by the group of M_N_L_F Misuari faction .
so there are the latest updates from here in Zamboanga City for the television of the nation together of course with R_T_V George Bandola .
George can you still hear us ?
<no-speech>
okay George I only have a question it has been appearing in the news that yes go ahead Kirby yes it has been appearing in the news that after the -- rescue here of our fellow citizens who were held hostage by the M_N_L_F there has already been a moping up and clearance operations there in the part of Santa Catalina in Zamboanga .
how is it going now George these moping up operations ?
<no-speech>
actually in these times Kirby we still don't have an idea but because the A_F_P has been persistently reminding the groups of journalists that the group of media are not allowed to come with the clearing operations that are being conducted .
Lieutenant Colonel Ramon Sagala has been mentioning since yesterday that within seventy percent of those areas infected by M_N_L_F are retrieved and are already being passed to P_N_P automatically for the clearing operations being conducted .
Philippine National Police has sent -- even on the first day of the siege forces from Region three and Region ten from Negros .
they were those who will conduct the clearing operations and mopping up operations and hopefully (()) there would be no like the kidnappings of the Zamboanga City Police Chief himself that will happen in the following hours .
