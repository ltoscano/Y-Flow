because we are only poor.
as long as you say these words nothing will change, and the world will continue to bring this upon you.
you can say instead that, "we are rich, problem is we don't want to act and get the blessing that are destined for us."
why are we poor?
and whatever state we are in, is it not nice that we are calm about it?
even though we are continuously bothered by our needs in life, everything is still good.
there is no longer excitement to take risks, to try and fight in life.
we are comfortable with that we have in front of us.
we are at peace and we have reasons; "endure when the viand is anchovy."
"curl when the blanket is short."
"even if the roof has its patches and walls are made of cartons, we will make it through."
"we could get by drinking alcohol"
"whatever"
useless words that are really off the mark and do not align with the goal to succeed in life.
the most dangerous for all of us is not that we have aimed so high and failed, but worse is that we aimed low and succeeded, and there in the ground where we step on, and only the worms are what we are left with.
