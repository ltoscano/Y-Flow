editorial: the style needs to be changed December 20, 2016 the message is clear in the last public survey: Pinoys want the iron hand and serious war against illegal drugs but they don't want the killings left and right that are happening.
the non-stop operation of the police against drug personalities is right but they should be caught alive, prosecuted and sentenced to be punished for being involved in illegal drugs.
life should never be easily wasted.
the majority of Pinoys believe that everybody has a chance to change and this chance should not be removed by anyone.
even a popular leader like President Digong Duterte.
even if the justice system in the country has many holes and bluffs, Pinoys would still like to undergo this process of convicting drug suspects.
here in this current system of "killings", no proof, no clear process by law, even the voices of the witnesses are drowned by loud words and declaration of the President that says, "drugs is a pest and protecting and rescuing the next generation is what I am doing."
he repeatedly says that the killings will continue until there is a drug dealer and pusher standing in street.
but what the people doesn't understand is why Peter Lim which he named himself (President Duterte) as one of the big-time drug lords in the Philippines and also said that he himself will kill him at the moment the moment he would step foot in the airport in the Philippines, until now freely enjoys his life
when he met with the President, President Duterte said himself "help us help you clear your name".
words that the President does not say to the ordinary drug suspects in the streets.
those who do not have "access" to speak with him.
those who only wear slippers, naked while paddling a pedicab or the ones covered with tattoos who were caught with a pack of meth.
in such cases, people are thinking why is there a difference on how the President treats drug personalities.
