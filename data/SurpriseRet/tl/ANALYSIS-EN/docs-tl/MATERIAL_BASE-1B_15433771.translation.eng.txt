even if it was crowded everybody was happy with the twenty-two floats that paraded in Session Road yesterday .
there were different themes and design which were divided in three categories .
the non-competing small and large float category .
the non-competing float of Baguio Country Club was inspired by Game of Thrones wherein its black dragon goes up and down because of hydraulics .
peacock rhinoceros zebra tiger and elephant were featured in the safari-inspired float of Manila North Tollways Corporation or NLEX .
Coach Yeng Guiao and the NLEX cager Asi Taulava who was very participative and is bonding with the crowd were also present .

the celebrities in the floats also added to the cheer factor .
Bagio locals like Carrot Man who went viral in social media because of his good looks were also featured .
the twenty sixteen Miss International Kylie Versoza was also present in another float .
I remember the times when I was there I was making my way in the crowd to watch and now I'm here on the float that's why it feels very -- it feels like such an honor such a privilege to be here .
the crowd cheered when Alden Richards and Maine Mendoza waved .
Bea Alonzo and Enchong Dee competed as they danced the running man challenge in their float .
