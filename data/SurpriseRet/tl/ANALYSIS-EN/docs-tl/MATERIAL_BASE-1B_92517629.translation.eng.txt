pronouncements versus
body language
Durian shake by Edith R. Regalado
the rumor that Davao City Mayor Rodriguo Duterte will possibly run for president in the coming 2016 national elections has been spreading.
but Duterte has repeatedly emphasized he has no plans, he is not interested, and he is not qualified to become the president of the country.
in every interview he has with the media, he says he does not want and he really has no plans to run for president.
this is despite of the persistence of some individuals and organizations persuading him to run.
but in spite of his pronouncements, Duterte's body language says otherwise.
Duterte's work has been different these past few days.
Duterte now goes to early engagements whereas before he does not wake up early.
if before he does not accept speaking engagements, now Duterte attends almost all national conventions here and in different parts of the country.
and it is a miracle that Duterte accepted the invitation of the military and even the Philippine National Police to be a speaker in their events in Camp Aguinaldo and Camp Crame.
what is it really, Mayor Duterte? will you run or not?
never mind, October 2015 is just a few months away. this is the time given to file the certificate of candidacy of those who have plans to run for national offices such as the president and the vice-president.
and when the time comes, Duterte's plans will be known. whether he will run for president or not.
