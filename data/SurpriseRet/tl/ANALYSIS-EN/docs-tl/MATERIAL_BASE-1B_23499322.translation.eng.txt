it's not that easy to give to others the houses for the soldiers and police like what President Duterte did .
that is according to the National Housing Authority it is stated by law who will be the beneficiaries of the housing project .
a news brought by China Gaston .
<no-speech>
the husband of Rhodalyn has been a soldier for twenty years but they are still renting an apartment in Quezon City .
the husband who's a technical sergeant at the Philippine Army has not really applied for a housing .
aside from the far distance of the housing projects for the military there are no means of earning there .
it is too far then we do not have a source of income there .
they are not feeling ill about the occupation done by the members of the Union of Sympathizers for the Poor or KADAMAY in almost six hundred housing units in Pandi Bulacan for the soldiers .
it was not given to others also to the poor so it is okay for us because for us we have salaries what is just disheartening if these are given to those who already have livelihood .
for the A_F_P this is not an issue that would cause the disheartening of the soldiers .
in general more than thirty thousand housing units are allocated for the soldiers in the whole country .
because the space hoped to be given which is twenty-two square meters is not enough for a growing family so the quality of life is affected so the appeal of our military is they are willing to pay an additional amount just accommodate the larger space %incomplete
but the National Housing Authority or N_H_A said that the action of the President has a major legal obstruction .
the General Appropriations Act or the annual national budget made by the Congress into a law .
it is very specific that the target beneficiaries are the A_F_P P_N_P and then all of a sudden you are reallocation or realigning to other beneficiaries outside the targeted group .
