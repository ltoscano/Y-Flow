in this place my brothers last September -- or September three -- September three eighteen ninety seven the members of the gathering including Teodorico Luna Novicio Antero Amatorio Norberto Valenzuela or Isabelo Palispis and others who signed the manifesto expressing their opposition to the powerful Spanish regime .
in this event my brothers the Philippine revolution against the Spaniards started in the Prince district or more known today as the town of Aurora .
aah so that is formerly called prince .
but now that is Aurora .

now you know ?
if you are heading there in Baler Aurora go to this Dikaloyungan that is one historical place because here residence certificates were torn by our Katipuneros who sacrificed their lives which is why we now have this so called freedom .
if not for their sacrifices .
