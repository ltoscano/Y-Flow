if you see a guitar in your dream, this represents about passion and emotion.
this may be also be related to sexual connotations and may possibly signal an erotic or sensual dream.
if the guitar is broken or has its strings removed, this possibly relates to disappointment in romance.
if you dream about a celebrity, this possibly represents a desire to find happiness and entertainment or pleasure.
Your admiration for a particular celebrity or artist may trigger getting some of their physical or personality traits.
these celebrities should be observed and evaluated, especially the characteristics of theirs that you may associate with your own personality.
this is because it's possible that these characteristics may be similar to things that you should identify with or incorporate into yourself.
there may also be a relationship between you and the roles or role being played by the celebrities that you see in your dreams.
even though you don't personally know the famous celebrities you see in your dreams, the roles they take on that you watch or your view and perception of their character may give you a clue to or understanding your connection to your dreams.
on the other hand, this may just be the result of what you see on TV or movies or stories that you've read about celebrities in tabloids and showbiz magazines, causing them to show up in your dreams.
if that's the case, then these celebrities don't have any significant meaning to you and their entry into your dreams is purely incidental.
