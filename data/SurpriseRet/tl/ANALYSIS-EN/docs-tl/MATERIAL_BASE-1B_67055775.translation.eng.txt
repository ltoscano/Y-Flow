Kim, crawled on Vhong by Allan Diones
January 7, 2017
the all-out support for Vhong Navarro not only by his companions in It's Showtime but also the other artists in ABS-CBN is gladdening.
Vhong is well-loved and has many friends in Channel Two so his film Mang Kepweng Returns is supported by them.
for the love of Vhong they plug it on social media, which surely helped because reportedly it reached P8.
8M in the film's opening day on Wednesday.
Vhong also has a different appeal especially to the youth because his antics in Mang Kepweng Retuns are really a hit with them.
when we watched it in Trinoma the laughter of the kids in the audience is loud and they react to the antics of Vhong.
the magical bandana worn by Mang Keps when he heals is a hit.
we saw many young people wearing cloth with polka dots that they put on the head ala Mang Kepweng.
because of Vhong it seems like that bandana has become a fashion statement, which in the movie has fantastic magical and healing powers.
the leading lady of Vhong Kim Domingo was not portrayed sexily in the film, but because her chest is overflowing the sexiness of the Kapuso star appears voluntarily.
their kissing scenes are always halted, but there is a scene where Kim crawled on and topped Vhong while he was sleeping.
you will not place malice on that scene because Kim is 'possessed' and her appearance suddenly changes while she is on top of Vhong.
the film is for children and families so you will not feel indecent about Kim topping Mang Keps.
Vhong's birthday wish is for his movie to earn, which seems like it will be given to him.
in fairness the ward of Director Chito Ro√±o is hardworking and kind, 2017 welcomed him beautifully because we heard Mang Kepweng returns already has a sequel.
the producer of Cineko Productions said, The Adventures of Mang Kepweng is the title of the next installment of the movie remake.
