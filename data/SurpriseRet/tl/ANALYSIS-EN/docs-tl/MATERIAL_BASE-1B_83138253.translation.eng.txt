directly do
anyone can do whatever he likes for himself, and if this is what he truly desires and directly wants to accomplish.
all of us has the ability to create great things, however, we hesitate to perform it.
the reason, we take priority over what others have to say, thinking we will be insulted if we fail.
there are a lot of speculations that we are trying to put emphasis on instead to apply the characteristics we possess in ourselves.
as long as we listen to the suggestions of others and get swayed by their surges and tampering, we become twisted and the road that we tread upon becomes complicated.
the direction that we are going gets blurry.
and in the long run, we lose our strength to persevere further ...
until we lose hope, finally surrender, and accept any event.
this is the fate of losers; they accepted and got used to the absence of hope, the absence of the ability and enthusiasm to carry on.
it's not surprising why their misery, suffering, and restlessness continues.
all of us have the power to choose, and to choose what is right.
prosperity or misery?
pleasure or sadness?
happiness or sorrow?
whatever you choose, is your destiny.
only you, the only one and greatly knows what is the true reason why yo continue to do what you do now.
because if you don't like your state now, there is no one that can stop you from fulfilling your dreams.
this is if you directly desire for your life to be changed.
anyone will surely be extraordinary and noticeable when he openly achieves his dreams.
when he's faith in himself to succeed is deep and earnest, he can overcome any barrier, he can resolve any problem, and there is no impossible thing that he cannot achieved.
if he will openly do it.
