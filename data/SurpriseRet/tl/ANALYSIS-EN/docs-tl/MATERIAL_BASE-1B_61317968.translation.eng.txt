November 24, 2015
on Friday two of the 12 in total FA 50 Golden Eagle fighter jets the country bought from South Korea will arrive.
this day is historic for the Philippine Air Force (PAF) because this is the first time since 2005 that the country will have fighter jets again.
"this is historic because this is the first time we will have jet fighters since we decommissioned our jets in 2005.
it will be the first time we will have a supersonic capability," declared Air Force spokesperson Colonel
Enrico Canaya.
the government spent up to P18.9 billion for buying the said war planes.
the step is still part of the Armed Forces of the Philippines modernization program.
year 2005 was when the PAF retired its F5 jets.
the new jets are set to arrive at Clark Air Base in Pampanga carrying its South Korean pilots.
before the formal turnover of the two jets they will first pass through a series of examinations and test flight.
the step to further strengthen the forces and competence of the AFP is happening in the midst of the hot discussion about the territorial issue in the West Philippine Sea.
earlier the Philippine Navy got new ships wherein the latest of these are getting BRP Ramon Alcaraz and BRP Gregorio Del Pilar aside from the landing ships from Australia.
in the recently finished visit to the country of US President Barack Obama he also reported the gifting of America of two additional ships to strengthen the navy forces of the country. -DCR
