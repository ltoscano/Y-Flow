many have said that when courting do everything for the beloved .
but the twenty-five year old who is Nelson David of Quezon City even risked his life .
according to his cousin David was only supposed to get mangoes from the tree to give to the girl he is courting but instead of mangoes his gaff struck an electric cable .
he asked permission from me to get mangoes .
he went here ?
actually he is our gardener sir .
the electricity sparked in the place that is why his cousin went out .
but the burnt body of the victim appeared to him .
his head was even slammed on a rock .
the rope and supposedly the container for the mangoes were still beside David .
when I heard the um of the electricity so I peeked I opened the window from there at the second floor .
then I really saw him .
then when I went down I saw him already fell sir .
David has not able to survive .
he was sent directly to the funeral parlor .
the owner of the compound decided to cut the hooked electricity wires so it will not cause accidents anymore .
