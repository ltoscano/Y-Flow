no doubt Pampanga is the culinary capital of the country .
in the midst of the sprout of modern recipes some are still making foods which have Kapampangan trademark alive since the time of war .
here is my assignment .
<no-speech>
Japanese Korean Mongolian Italian American .
seems all international cuisine could be found here in Pampanga .
along with the flock of tourists various foreign dishes are sprouting on both sides .
in fact almost sixty percent of guest arrivals in Angeles City last year were foreigners .
it has rooted from what was that the presence of the military bases right so well of course -- if that is like that you would know that there are a lot of -- a lot of foreigners .
some of the traditional Kapampangan dishes seemed to have finally buried in forgetfulness .
so this is what the seventy-five year old Atching Lilian tries to resurrect .
she has researched for six years to recover some of the vanishing dishes of Pampanga .
just similar with Quisa which was often cooked at the time of war .
this made with mixed products in Pampanga like peanuts sweet potato and corn cooked with the boiled rice .
this recipe is called Ikim Baka only a few knows .
adapted to a Spanish dish mixed with pork sausage potato tomato and cow tail .
we should be proud of what our ancestors have planted .
I call those first cooks the unsung heroes of the kitchen .
because they weren't known but Pampanga was known because of them .
not only his dishes are antique but also his things in the kitchen that was strengthened by many years .
<foreign><foreign> we can see the things of my ancestors aging two centuries .
who else will inherit the traditional Pampangan recipe but the youth .
that's why here in Angeles City even at a young age children are already trained in cooking .
Pampanga has to keep up it's reputation because they're Pampangan they have to know where they came from .
their specialty this day is their pride the Kapampangan sisig .
the -- our cooking is so yummy .
it's delicious .
we cook and cut food .
there is nothing wrong with progress and coming of different influences of food .
but in the middle of modernization let's not forget the dishes that made our culture and history delicious .
the formula there is to balance right ?
while -- while there are some new things that come out along the way we are still with the campaign of promoting our local cuisine that should not be lost .
