Rhian cried fabulously by Allan Diones December 23, 2016 Rhian Ramos is emotional after the press preview of her 2016 MMFF movie Saving Sally.
because finally, after more than 7 years since she made the movie, it will be released to the cinema and will be watched by the public.
"I don't want to highlight our movie so much, but it is really tear-jerking. because, I am so happy with the result and it was everything I hoped it would be and more," Rhian expressed happily, Saving Sally was made during the time of Zorro (2009) by Richard Gutierrez of GMA.
"it has been so long since I did this and before, in the past I sneaked out just to have an audition for this movie, this is the result I have in mind. actually, the animation part is nicer than I pictured. because, the curiosity of me, it built up as years passed by. and then, of course, we were asking when it would be shown. but it was still not okay for the standard of director Avid (Liongoren), so, it's like he worked on the movie and reworked on it again and again.
it became layered. at first, like regular cartoons. then, there was more details. then more and more details year after year until this became the result. when I was watching it, I really enjoyed it for the innocence of the project. you will really feel that it has a happy, innocent vibe that is not intimidating. it's like having a conversation with a kid with a huge imagination, excitedly telling a story.
"in those things," assertively said by the 26-year old Kapuso actress.
