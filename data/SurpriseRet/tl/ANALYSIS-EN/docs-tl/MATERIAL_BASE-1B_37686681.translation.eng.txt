preparations for the feast of Black Nazarene this Saturday is continuous .
because more than ten million devotees are expected to attend the procession .
Rommel Lopez is taking action .
the inside and outside of the minor basilica of the Black Nazarene in Quiapo Manila is being painted .
this is part of the preparation for the parade of the Black Nazarene this coming Saturday .
hosts are the men who guard the stand for the saints in the procession .
our devotion our vow is what we need to do .
tomorrow the final route of the procession will be released but this won't be any different from last year .
from Quirino grand stand the parade will pass Jones bridge on the way back to Quiapo .
that's the road around Quiapo which is under construction by D_P_W_H .
especially because the influx is expected to not be less than three million devotees.
every year we have an increase of twenty percent .
the feast of Black Nazarene will be an international pilgrimage of the Black Nazarene .
we're international now that's why we're expecting more foreigners coming in .
the Manila police district has also prepared and started to roam for security .
at present we haven't received any threats for the celebration .
the men has reminded those in bad condition to not join the crowd .
also avoid the filing on stands .
because sometimes accidents happen there .
the Nazarene is always here right ?
hence all chances are there for them .
hopefully not the procession .
on Thursday procession for replicates of Nazarene will start .
this Friday on the other hand Quiapo church will bring out the Black Nazarene to take to the Quirino grand stand for the kissing and overnight vigil .
Rommel in action .
