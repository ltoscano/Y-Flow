even if modern wrestling is now popularized among natives of Ifugao they don't forget their traditional wrestling the Bultong .
their own kind of wrestling is done to resolve to land disputes .
let's hear from Victoria Tulad .
<no-speech>
an Ifugao forcefully knocked down the other by clinging on to his loin cloth .
it seems like that the two Ifugaos are fighting but in reality they're just doing the traditional Bultong .
this is the traditional wrestling of Ifugaos done to resolve land disputes .
Marvin's father won the land where his house stands now in Bultong .
I think this is the land he won .
this was a cogon before but it was renovated because we're already modernized now .
that's how Marvin's family gives importance to Bultong hence aside from his brothers he also teaches his nephews Bultong .
so that it won't be forgotten -- by our race .
that is our culture that may -- until the end until now it cannot be removed .
Bultong that is witnessed in feasts has been an inspiration to grade ten students Arselina and Geoff to join modern wrestling .
I was at grade eight when I started to join wrestling .
I had an intention because we could also show our strengths there .
in Hungduan National High School there are many like them that develops the discipline and courage when training after class .
with their help I tried modern wrestling .
so now Arci will teach us the basic techniques of modern wrestling .
what do we do first Arsi ?
first sir so in the warm up sir to avoid sir the injury like that sir .
what Arsi and the others do everyday is not a joke especially when sparring .

although we are not in the modern time and many have developed interest in modern wrestling Ifugaos still believe that Bultong will not be forgotten because this tradition is the foundation of everything they have today .
