(()) aside from volleyball what do you like doing in your past time ?
if you have any past time .
in Tagalog past time %incomplete
what do you like to do ?
I blog .
story short stories anything blog (()) .
located in my twitter account is my blog .
and also I like to watch series T_V series like the revenge vampire diaries gossip girl glee those kind .
<no-speech>
really girlish right those ones okay ?
yes a real girl outside the court .
because before -- I was accustomed in La Salle of not having T_V there .
it is not allowed because you really need -- to focus with your studies and the laptop only .
what you entered isn't that a precinct ?
you are not allowed to have a boyfriend no T_V .
it's like a prison probably %incomplete
no sir .
huh ?
okay (()) .
okay with us .
for -- for us it is really okay having no T_V .
ah .
indeed even %incomplete
there's a cellphone right ?
cellphone .
is there also something where you get to call once every day ?
what is the %incomplete
none .
if we have a game there is a need to confiscate those phone .
why what is the philosophy behind having no T_V ?
because if you have T_V and then you have -- you have lessons you cannot focus in your studies .
even now when we are only talking and we kept on studying it is already hard to balance really .
and your level in Candy Crush will not increase if and you cannot play -- move away from Crossy Road .

the mailman seems to be taking long .
that -- that's it .
from Jeff or .
that is hard to answer because well we are not allowed -- to well choose sides well because they are both my friend and my teammates .
they are like my sisters those two .
Ate Cha really she became my team mate for three years in La Salle so she is one of the seniors I look up to .
she is like a mentor %incomplete
she was also my team captain for two years so it's really there it was built up our the sisterhood for the two of us .
okay .
Phil on the other hand we're teammates in Meralco and Petron .
I knew him better as I can prove the people that what they're saying is wrong what you're saying to -- the athletes that we're arrogant persnickety snob because we like what happened to Phil you can really -- prove that this person is kind I'm really happy that we're teammates because it's not -- not just in La Salle that you'll meet friends .
outside outside La Salle you'll have -- meet plenty of people that will be your teammates like Phil .
kind person good to work with to play with in the court and -- a good athlete that will push you to be the best in your field .
another question do we more questions ?
okay how is Ara Galang and Camille Cruz ?
there so far Ara and Camille I can say that these -- two girls are strong hence don't worry because they are fighters not just in court but in real life as well .
whatever they're going through now they're really fighting it .
and -- they have big faith on God God is working on something better for them .
and now I don't know when's Camille's surgery but I know that Ara's is if not this week maybe next week she'll be undergoing -- she'll undergo -- surgery for her uh .
Camille ?
for Camille three on the right knee are A_C_L or L_C_L I think and bone bruise .
also I mean they're still young healing process is faster .
I had A_C_L before I was just nineteen then .
nineteen .
but at that time there was no arthroscopic surgery yet .
not yet .
<no-speech>
no doctors yet ?
