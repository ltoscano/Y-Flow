the taxpayers with individual tax due of over two thousand were allowed to pay their taxes in installment .
the first installment is on the day of filing with a deadline last April fifteen and the second installment with a deadline this July fifteen .
once you pay your second installment after July fifteen there is an additional penalty which is the surcharge of twenty-five per cent J and then there is also -- twenty per cent interest per annum .
so it is a big thing if the taxes this July will be collected .
it is also the deadline of the monthly percentage tax for the non-VAT taxpayers on July twenty .
and July twenty-five is the deadline for the quarterly vat returns .
if all this are collected by B_I_R possibly after July their collection will hit more than one billion pesos .
they target to collect a two point zero eight billion pesos this year .
but if it would be based on the collection this May the collection of the department fell short of thirty million pesos .
they are positive to reach the target .
this is despite the explosion of the controversial pork barrel scam where the officials of the government are accused of squandered or pocketed billions of taxes of the citizens .
it is slowly discovered where your payments are going I hope that you will not be discouraged because that is already here that is already discovered perhaps next year or their future .
our payments is costly in the right way .
for Ma'am Virginia the citizens should benefit from the taxes paid through hard work .
those taxpayers they worked hard to pay the tax .
then it won't be returned to them the %incomplete
B_I_R said the problem is not with them because they are remitting all the collected taxes to the national treasury .
so the taxes will be used in funding the projects of the government .
