in memory of her
in memory of her (Luke 8: 1-30
in churches we can always see old women ministering.
they are the women whom we cannot remember when they became part of the church.
they are also the women always present even when the priest is replaced.
whatever the personality of the priest, despite how many times they cry and suffer, you can still see them inside the church ministering silently.
it seems there is nothing that can stop them so they have become the image of the church... as if the image of the church is incomplete if there is no space for them.
they may be in the choir that is why their voices seem to have become the official voice of the mass.
they are also lectors and commentators who, due to the length of their service, seem to make the celebration incomplete if they are missing.
they are also the collectors that, even with eyes closed, are probably very familiar with their duty.
they are also the ushers who guide churchgoers whenever there is mass.
and if you will look at what is inside the church during mass, majority of those are women.
what will be the image of the Church if women are not around?
it is gratifying because the gospel mentioned the women who accompanied Jesus in his proclamation of the word of God.
they are Mary Magdalene, Juana, and Susana.
even if their actions are not recorded here, we know that behind the work of Jesus and his disciples, women cannot be absent.
they did not become famous but it was their joy to help Jesus.
Pope Francis said: "women in the church have had and have a special role in opening the doors to the Lord, in following him, in communicating his message."
the role of women in church is really big.
which is why every time we go to church, do not forget to thank them.
and let us always remember, the church is not only for men... women always have an important role in the growth of the church...
