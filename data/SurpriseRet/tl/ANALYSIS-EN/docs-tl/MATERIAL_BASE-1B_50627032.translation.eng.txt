eye-ball: best 4 in the NCAA by @dbuzzketball
September 22, 2016
our RP national volleyball team led by Mika Reyes practices in Arellano gym.
that is supposedly assistance from Arellano to our national team.
Arellano U is fabulous!
Arellano, San Beda, Mapua and Perpetual Help.
the best 4 in the NCAA.
that will surely be a lively fight in the Final 4 that will be held in MOA Arena.
in the junior division - San Beda, Arellano, CSB Greenhills and Mapua.
that will surely be a death match because everyone wants to break the 7-peat of San Beda.
Kiefer Ravena just got back from the US but he is already on a connecting flight to Singapore.
so he has almost no time here in Manila because it all just seems like a stopover.
Kiefer's passion for his game is extreme.
Kiefer will play for the Mighty Sports team in Singapore.
an NCAA college team seems to be wooing the brother of a famous PBA player for its campaign next year.
will he accept the offer?
