Duterte is not convinced of his child's story
April 21, 2016
seems that Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte did not take the revelation of his daughter Sara Duterte that she was a rape victim.
in her social media account, Sara said, "not a joke.
I am a rape victim but I will still vote for President Rodrigo Duterte," followed by Day 14.
finally said it.
good morning."
it is believed that Sara made the statement to stop the anger of the public towards her father for joking, "the mayor should be the first in queue" in raping Jacqueline Hamil by an Australian missionary.
Duterte directly said that he does not believe what her daughter Sara said.
this is impossible to happen because Sara has a gun.
"she can't be raped, she carries a gun," the mayor said.
in his speech in the University of Visayas, Duterte said that his daughter is a drama queen so she tells that kind of thing.
Duterte refused to ask for a sorry for the words he uttered about Hamil.
