Miss U bets, let's make them happy!
candidates of Miss Universe were made completely happy this past week because they were absolutely admired by the Filipino people.
wherever different groups of the 65th Miss U contestants visited, they were warmly welcomed by the people, waiting for several hours just to see and be waved at.
several candidates almost cried when they saw the children and elderly waiting on the streets in Caticlan, Boracay, Vigan City, Baguio City, Batangas and Davao City.
why are we so happy when some visit our country and homes, and we accommodate, feed and entertain them?
"that is the famous Filipino hospitality that can never be forgotten and will be missed by the Miss U candidates when they go home to their own countries," said Undersecretary Kat de Castro of the Department of Tourism.
what else but our offer of friendship.
we respect and admire these 86 beautiful, smart and talented young women.
that is contrary to what several groups are whining about, that beauty contestants are being treated like sex objects.
well those who are saying that seem to be lacking in attention, that even a prestigious beauty competition won by three great Filipinas is being politicized.
it's good to just ignore those people who are lacking in attention.
let us just make sure that our guests are safe from any kind of harm and offer them an experience that they will never ever forget.
