Lovi, was able to write a song from so much inspiration by Allan Diones
September 5, 2016
Lovi Poe was too inspired in her new Kapuso drama series co-starring with Tom Rodriguez so she was able to write a song.
after the press conference of Someone to Watch Over Me Lovi was inspired by her character Joanna who is the wife of TJ (Tom), who had early-onset Alzheimer's disease, so she was able to write her song Sana'y Maalala.
the Kapuso actress said, even if Someone to Watch Over Me is the title of a song it will not be used as the theme song of the series, so there is a chance that her own composition will become its theme song.
it is also possible that there is already a song chosen to be used as the official theme song of the said Kapuso drama and Lovi's Sana'y Maalala will become the second theme song, that in fairness is perfect for the theme of the soap opera, that Tom's memory is gradually disappearing due to Alzheimer's.
even Tom is so happy and excited at the song Lovi made.
Lovi has enjoyed writing songs for some time, since she was in grade school, so she has accumulated quite a lot of her own compositions.
the pilot telecast of Someone to Watch Over Me is tonight on GMA Telebabad after the Descendants of the Sun.
as a married couple who are really in love with each other Lovi and Tom have a lot of kissing scenes here.
they also have love scenes, which is preferred by Director Maryo J.
de los Reyes to appear realistic and convincing to viewers that they are really in love.
