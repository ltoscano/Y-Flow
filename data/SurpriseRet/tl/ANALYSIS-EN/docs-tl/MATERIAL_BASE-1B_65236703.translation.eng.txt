frightening .
experts are now having a new debate on where Jesus Christ was really born ?
<no-speech>
according to the shocking research there were two places in Israel which were called Bethlehem .
there was a small town there called Galilee .
in traditional Christmas celebrations of the birth of Jesus we were already accustomed to the fact that he was born in a manger in Bethlehem West Bank in the country of Israel .
but there is supposedly a second Bethlehem which is a small village one thousand miles away from the north of Bethlehem .
this is allegedly the real place where Mary gave birth to his son Jesus .
<no-speech>
Aviram Oshri an official of the Israel Antiquities Authority said he believes that there is indeed a second Bethlehem and the life of Jesus was spent in Galilee and Kinneret .
the distance of the village from Nazareth is eight miles which is why it is impossible for Mary to walk to a place that far .
that would be hard because she is pregnant and it would take days to reach Nazareth if she would give birth to Christ there .
doctor Oshri said that Maria rode a donkey upon giving birth Maria was cuddling Jesus during those times .
but it is curious what are the chances that the infant Jesus would live while riding a donkey from Bethlehem to Judea .

someone said that Jesus was born at Nazareth .
said by doctor Uzi Dahari an archaeologist in the Roman times when Jesus lived people were prohibited to transfer from place to place back then .
<no-speech>
because the whole family of Jesus came from Nazareth the archaeologist believes that here in Nazareth Jesus was born .
but in the present time what is given importance are the things done by Jesus upon birth and not where he was born .
Jesus Christ is important to many because he is a good example of a human being in the world .

so what is the meaning of celebrating his birthday if the one whose birthday is not happy with the unruliness of many .
the reason for his birth is to continue the teachings he started .
the teaching of true love between people .
