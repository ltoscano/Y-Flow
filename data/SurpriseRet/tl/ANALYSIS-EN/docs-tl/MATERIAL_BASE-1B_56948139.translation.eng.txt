new tax bill, ready as well by Aries Cano July 2, 2016 Marikina representative Miro Quimbo proposed a new and improved income tax measure.
under his proposal House Bill 20 more than six million Filipino workers are expected to be given individual income tax brackets adjustments according to inflation and lowering of tax burdens.
despite the previous congress failing to approve the proposal to lower the tax charged to ordinary workers due to the opposition of the Department of Finance (DOF) Quimbo is more determined to push for the reform of the current income tax system.
the proposal he submitted is simpler, efficient and an equitable tax system especially now that the Duterte administration has expressed support for the proposal in accordance with its 10-point economic agenda too.
