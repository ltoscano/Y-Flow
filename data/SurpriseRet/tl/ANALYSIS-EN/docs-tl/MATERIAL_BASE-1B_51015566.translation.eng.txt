flare: 2 bosses impossible by Al S. Mendoza.
August 12, 2016
Manny Pacquiao confirmed his fight against Jessie Vargas on November 6 (PHL time).
and he said that this will not interfere with his promise that he will focus on his job in the Senate.
he's supposedly a senator by day, a boxer by night.
which means, he is knee-deep in proposed laws when the sun rises.
when darkness falls, we have practice runs and training in the gym.
that twin-strategy was molded after his meeting with Bob Arum.
Arum, the American promoter of Pacquiao, immediately came to the Philippines after he has set the Pacquiao-Vargas fight in Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas.
I have said here many times that when Arum decides, Pacquiao just obeys.
that is a relationship that was set in stone way back in 2006.
there is no problem if Pacquiao returns to the fight after his retirement.
in my opinion, it's almost impossible - if not really impossible - the tactics prepared by Pacquiao.
Senate in the morning, boxing at night.
two faiths.
two boss-chief.
that's too tight.
there's a saying in English: "you can't serve two masters at the same time."
you cannot please both masters that you serve.
the result was jealousy.
in short, Pacquiao takes a vacation from the senate and concentrates again to boxing.
that is the key to success.
only one master.
there is only one God.
