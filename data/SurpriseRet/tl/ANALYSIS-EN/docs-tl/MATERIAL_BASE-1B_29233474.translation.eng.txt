World War II
World War II (Mark 3:22-30)
second world war
people saw the consequence of fighting among nations.
the people experienced the difficulty of being divided and misunderstanding.
many died.
many buildings were destroyed.
many dreams did not come true.
because of this experience, many leaders of the countries talked and discussed on how this huge conflict will not be repeated again.
this was when the United Nations was formed on October 24, 1945 that will give a peaceful arrangement in instances where nations are in conflict.
this will also help those countries experiencing calamity and poverty.
this is the result of nations seeking for unity for the people.
this is also what Jesus wants for the people... that all will be one just like he and the Father are one.
Jesus was accused that the healing he does comes from evil.
but Jesus said that this is not possible because if a demon will go against a demon too, they will be divided and they will be destroyed.
Jesus brought healing because this is what cures wounds caused by sins.
in the home, when members of the family are fighting and clashing, the family does not cause happiness and instead leads them to become more distant to each other.
in a country where the people especially the leaders are not united, the nation also does not grow instead it pulls each one down.
it is likewise with the church.
if the members of the Church are jealous of each other, gossip, and do not trust the ability of each one, its growth will also be not good.
if all of us have our own selfish agenda, the Church will surely go nowhere.
if we are always fighting surely our destination will be the swamps.
let us unite under the one banner of love!
