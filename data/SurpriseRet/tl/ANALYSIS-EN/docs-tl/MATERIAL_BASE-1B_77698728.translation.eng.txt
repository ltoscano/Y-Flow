I got acquainted with mister Gin who formerly dives to catch aquarium fish .
<no-speech>
pineapple fish .
yes this is rare .
maybe it's been along time for me ten years I have seen something like this only today .
it is hard to -- the fish it is only expensive as long as you dive deep the fish that will be caught is really beautiful .
if only manually the butterflies the -- those things only even something like this you will not find anything even if you dive for how many years well you will not see it manually .
<no-speech>
mister Gin has already left diving with the kids such as Alfie .
now he is the one buying their catch .
<no-speech>
the patron divers of mister Gin were also the ones that serve as porters on their transport of the fishes .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
the sun is about to set when mister Gin and his wife transported the aquarium fishes which were for sale across the island of Masinloc .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
after getting back to the opposite shore mister Gin and his porters immediately started gathering fish .
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
<no-speech>
approximately sixty thousand is the capital of mister Gin every time he travels .
the seven thousand and five hundred rent for the jeep is still not included here .
<no-speech>
nobody monitors or inspects the fishes being transported by mister Gin .
because the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources or BFAR has no capability to do this .
<no-speech>
but the worry of the residents of barangay San Salvador is the foreboding prohibition of aquarium fishing in their place by the local government of Masinloc and BFAR .
if this happened those who are similar with Alfie and Rosemarie will lose a livelihood .
there are still no endangered species shown in the sites .
we have no like monitoring system on how to have monitored that aquarium fishing that one .
<no-speech>
should be that should be regulated because those other species are somewhat lessening .
BFAR is forming a program to teach them .
<no-speech>
only during vacations when Alfie's voyage goes often .
he is not neglecting his studies .
even if he needs to work hard for his family .
in fact he is actually the second honor of their school .
when I graduated elementary this is what I got in (()) .
this is the latest the Math .
until now I am still the top two in first year .
I want to finish studying and look for a job .
I am going to be an engineer if -- I would be able to study in college .
I will work very hard dive and save to if if to sell more can save .
that's it I will try to -- study .
<no-speech>
but while it is vacation Alfie is not minding his dream to become an engineer yet .
it is more important for him to dive for fishes to sell especially that he has a sibling who needs medication .
instead of becoming a burden on your family you are not doing anything .
you -- are just wandering off there if you have something to help your family you help .
because it is difficult now that life is like only money is operating the people now .
money if you do not have money like now you are not going to live .
<no-speech>
while Rosemarie is still waiting for the day to arrive she will be allowed to go with her parents to the middle of the sea .
<no-speech>
but for now Rosemarie cannot do anything but to hope that like the colorful fishes they are catching their life will also become beautiful .
<no-speech>
Alfie and Rosemarie are the two youth in San Salvador .
two young kids who are dreaming that one day they will be free from the face of poverty in the island .
children who have dreams to fulfill and hoping they will not remain as fishes continuously swimming wherever the flow of fate carries them .
