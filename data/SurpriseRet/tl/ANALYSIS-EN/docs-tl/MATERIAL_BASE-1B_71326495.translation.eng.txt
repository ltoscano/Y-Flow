Pong Biazon in the senate. it is only right to bring back the loyal and principled senator Pong Biazon in the Senate.
the man has a unique style in public service even in exposing the issues in the Higher and Lower Congress.
aside from the inherent charisma, the old Biazon has also an extraordinary style that even if you are already angry, you cannot be ill-tempered with the former general of the country.
unlike now that instead of rising, the rating of Senator Alan Cayetano and Antonio Trillanes from the people has fallen down because the citizens know their motives and most of all, the masses do not want a bullying style.
it is clear that the track record of Pong Biazon in the Senate is good and that is proven by the laws he created such as the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act; law on the reformation in renting; law for the modernization of the Armed Forces; law on the amendment of the membership of the Pag-IBIG Fund, law on building UP Mindanao, law that strengthens the Caraga Region and others.
Pong Biazon is clear in advocacy that he addresses all problems and that is the primary reason to bring him back to the Senate.
coming from the poor and knows the life of the poor so he understands the problem of the children of the sweat should be made a priority of the government.
even in being a soldier, even if a class goat in his classes at the PMA, he has proven that he can lead the whole Armed Forces of the Philippines which brought him to the Senate because of defending the former president Cory Aquino against Coup d'Ã©tat.
it is clear that the old Biazon has dedication and courage for right aspiration and that should be hold on to for us to bring him back to the Higher Congress.
the old Biazon lacks money and we should help for that because the old wise man is the real public servant.
