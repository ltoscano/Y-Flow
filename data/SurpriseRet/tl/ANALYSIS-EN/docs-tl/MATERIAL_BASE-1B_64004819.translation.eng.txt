September 05, 2016
Koronadal City, South Cotabato, September 6 (PIA) - the continuing growth of the coffee industry in the province of South Cotabato is expected, according to an official here.
in a recent press conference, South Cotobato Provincial Agriculturist Justina Navarrete confirmed that the head of the Philippine Rural Development Project gave a "No Objection Letter" to the proposed "Enhancement of Production and Marketing of Dried Green Coffee" project of South Cotabato.
the 14 million-peso project will be led by Tupi Coffee Growers Association, Incorporated (TUCOGAI) which is based in the town of Tupi together with other cooperatives of coffee farmers in the Upper Valley and Lower Valley of South Cotabato.
TUCOGAI estimated that through the project the coffee production in South Cotabato will increase by 10 percent in six years.
the income of the coffee farmers in the province will also increase because TUCOGAI pays more for the coffee products of the farmers: Php 12 per kilo of fresh coffee berries and Php 63 per kilo of dried green coffee beans.
the green coffee bean project of TUCOGAI is the fifth project approved by PRDP for the SOCCSKARGEN region.
before this, the PRDP also approved the 39.4 million-peso Production of Cassava Granules and Marketing project of South Cotabato; the 35.7 million-peso Enhancement of Production, Processing and Marketing to High Quality Abaca Fiber of Sarangani; the 43.4 million-peso Virgin Coconut Oil Processing project of Sarangani and the 14.9 million-peso Rubber Sheet Processing and Marketing of North Cotabato.
Navarrete is expecting that all documents for the dried green coffee project will be completed before the end of the year so it can begin by January of 2017.
