90 children in Sarangani have undergone the feeding program
May 25, 2016 City of Koronadal, South Cotabato, May 25 (PIA) - up to 90 malnourished children in Alabel, Sarangani, including around 20 child laborers are the current beneficiaries of a feeding program by the Department of Labor and Employment Sarangani Field Office.
the RS Po Foundation of Century Pacific Food is helping DOLE-Sarangani in implementing the feeding program in Pag-asa Integrated Elementary School in Barangay Pag-asa in the town of Alabel.
the first round of the feeding program will last 45 and was started this vacation to prepare the children for school.
aside from the feeding program, the DOLE Sarangani Field Office also helped the parents of 20 child laborers to be given temporary livelihood under the DOLE-Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa Ating Disadvantaged Workers (DOLE-TUPAD) program.
according to Sarangani Field Office OIC head Alma Borela, Barangay Pag-asa is one of the most affected by El Nino, causing the parents to lose livelihood; some of them were forced to make their children work.
the reason for the increase of malnourished children in the said area is also attributed to El Nino.
Borela reminded the parents, the children should be going to school and not allowed to work to earn for the family.
