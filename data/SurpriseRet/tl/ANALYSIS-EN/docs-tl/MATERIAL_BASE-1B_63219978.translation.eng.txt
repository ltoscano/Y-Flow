meanwhile the high school student in Cebu who was earlier prohibited by her school because of a bikini picture in Facebook will be able to march on her graduation .

<no-speech>
with the effect of the order of the court the student of Saint Theresa's College in Cebu will be able to march tomorrow on her graduation who was first prohibited because of her picture in a bikini posted on Facebook .
the court also ordered that she be allowed to join practice her complete name be called in the ceremony and be allowed to receive the diploma .
included in the basis of the decision is not giving due process to the student before her punishment was decided .
in the order of the judge -- of the court they will just restrain the imposition of the sanction .
it's a temporary in nature then after trial on the merit then there will be a final or permanent injunction .
the S_T_C Cebu refused to give a statement when G_M_A news came to them earlier .
but yesterday its management reasoned that the restriction is a school obligation as a Catholic school .
like the S_T_C Cebu the Catholic school of Jo not her true name is also strict .
those who will post a picture in bikini will be end up in the guidance office .
and in order to avoid unpleasant pictures it is said that someone is monitoring their Facebook accounts .
what I only hear from our school that they remind students not to post it because it's internet .
someone can see it and then they can edit it and then post to another website .
they may also not be allowed to join the graduation rites if they will receive a low grade of D in deportment or carrying one's self .
but for the mother of Jo this strictness doesn't matter .
I enrolled my child to a Catholic school to be God-fearing and then her education is much better .
according to DepEd although strict and outdated for others they respect the procedures of Catholic schools .
however they already sent staff from the division to investigate the incident in Saint Theresa's College Cebu .
the department recognizes the rights of private schools to give procedures if the punishment to be imposed will violate our laws then DepEd can intervene there .
but if not then that we recognize .
I am Victoria Tulad your witness .
