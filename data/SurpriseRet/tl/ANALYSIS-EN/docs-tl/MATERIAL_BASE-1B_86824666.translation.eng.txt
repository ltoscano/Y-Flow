curses of Digong, need to be addressed by Aries Cano
June 7, 2016
Buhay Party-list Representative Lito Atienza emphasized that President-elect Rodrigo Duterte cursing others will not do any good.
"cursing your fellowmen and not just the media for that matter.
a priest bishop or common person should not be cursed.
if he (President-elect Duterte) does not correct his ways he will realize many problems unattended and even worsening if he does not give it immediate attention," added Atienza.
lastly, "this is unsolicited advice, let us first fix the big problems before we argue with anyone," he finished.
Duterte challenging the media is supposedly even a display of his character that he does not want to be called out.
