the upcoming recognition of Janell Mae Frayna to be the first Filipino Chess Grandmaster is a success for women .
news brought to you by Chino Trinidad .
after seven years of thoroughly studying sports which is thought to be just for men Janell finally reached her first target the grandmaster norm .
however the psychology major from Far Eastern University knows that this is just a start of her big mission .
-- not only my personal achievement .
as for me I want something similar to what you have said I want to become an ambassador for women chess now .
Janell is molded with the help of the Filipino grandmasters together with her discover and coach Grandmaster Jason Gonzales .
at a younger age before of thirteen Grandmaster Gonzales had already seen the important elemental foundation of a World Class Chess Player in Janell .
that was one element so in becoming a grandmaster .
that I have not seen in the length of my teaching .
and even with my colleagues in others are already grandmasters or else I'm not so hardworking in studying .
she might have a high confidence now of her abilities Janell does not stop studying who is set to finish B_S Psychology as cum laude this coming May .
even if she has defeated a lot of men Janell accepts that there are still more -- lacking in her chess game .
we are so emotional especially when playing .
like instead of being objective in the position .
despite of that we can expect that Janell can reach higher whose new challenge to the self is for her to be able to the top ten World Chess Ratings .
I always tell people that nobody is born a genius .
and in my perspective for me that is very applicable that because all I am doing even in chess I really know I have worked hard for it .
