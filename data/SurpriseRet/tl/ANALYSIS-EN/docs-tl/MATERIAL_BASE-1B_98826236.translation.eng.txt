it was in eightieth decade when Julio Diaz or Mariano de Leon in real life entered the world of showbiz .
<no-speech>
ninth of April twenty sixteen one event put Julio in the brink of danger .
three days before the I was socialized in a you know whatever prohibited medicine we say .
<no-speech>
there was an argument between Julio and his staff .
<no-speech>
his head was getting hot followed by weakness of his body .
<no-speech>
he thought it was a simple ill feeling there was already a serious reason .
he had a condition called brain aneurysm .
<no-speech>
Julio's condition in the intensive care unit or I_C_U became critical because of the eruption of his aneurysm .
brain or cerebral aneurysm is the swelling of weak parts of walls of the artery or veins where blood flows to our hearts .
factors that can increase its eruption with the increase of blood pressure or or high cholesterol or blood sugar because it weakens veins right ?
<no-speech>
with the continuous development of the aneurysm or swelling of veins the artery walls become more thin which can eventually lead to burst eruption or rupture .
<no-speech>
in the case of Julio his aneurysm burst which caused the bleeding of his brain which we call subarachnoid hemorrhage .
that means Julio got a stroke .
his aneurysm is in the anterior communicating artery .
so it's relatively in front but it's still in the middle of the brain .
if it bursts in other words the blood covers the -- covers the surface of the brain .
brain aneurysm is usually asymptomatic or has no certain symptoms .
but according to experts if aneurysm bursts the patient usually experience severe headaches high blood pressure dizziness and vomiting and loss of consciousness .
Julio was in comatose for ten days and to save his life he underwent an expensive and sensitive operation called endovascular treatment or curling procedure .
usually we inject on the common femoral artery which is the vein in the groin area .
in the insertion of tube or catheter it will be bridged inside the vein and that small catheter will be extended up to the inside of the aneurysm .
.
if you are inside the aneurysm I will draw out a coil through that catheter that to clog the aneurysm from the inside so the blood will not enter it .
<no-speech>
according to studies most of those who have aneurysm are those in the age of thirty-five until sixty but children are not also safe from this .
women have more chances to have this than men .
in whole world an estimation of half a million every year have died because of this illness .
