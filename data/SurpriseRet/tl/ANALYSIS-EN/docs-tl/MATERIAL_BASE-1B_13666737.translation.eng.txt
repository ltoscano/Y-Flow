Marjorie also noticed that the fruits and vegetables that she buys from Farmer's Market takes longer to rot .
it's really for one week it hasn't spoiled yet .

storekeeper Teresita is happy because their simple display of organic food became a hit in GenSan .
that is why they make sure that they do not use pesticides in their products .
nothing beats the natural .
when we eat natural so when we say natural it means that it's only what we created for -- a natural spray -- just spray that's the only thing we use that's what the D_A taught us .
organic food are foods like vegetables fruits or meat where no pesticides or chemicals were used .
it is rich with nutrients and is a good prevention against cancer that is commonly acquired in foods that have pesticides or with preservatives .
this is an advocacy by not only by me but to all the people that has hearts for those small farmers and home producers .
for them to have the opportunity to have -- a livelihood too .
aside from the cheap and healthy food featured in the Farmer's Market is the techno-demo like how to make the famous Maguindanaon delicacy known as Tinagtag .
it's because it was dismissed the recipe of (()) ours and that's only rice and sugar .
for those who want to buy the organic food they can visit the Farmer's Market every Sunday in Ramas residences at Tiongson extension in Baranggay Lagaw .
