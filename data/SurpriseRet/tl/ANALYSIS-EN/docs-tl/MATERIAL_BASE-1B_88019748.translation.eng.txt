drug test for athletes, coaches, and sports officials is pending by Ramil Cruz.
September 19, 2016
in obedience to the strict campaign of anti-drug users and pushers by President Rodrigo Duterte, mandatory drug testing is on the radar of the Philippine Sports Commission for national athletes, coaches and even officials of around 53 national sports associations (NSA's).
this is one of the plans of PSC Chairman William Ramirez at the PSC executive board and NSA's presidents/secretary generals meeting tomorrow, September 20 at the Century Park Hotel in Malate, Manila.
"it is one of the agenda but we have to talk about it deeply with the NSA's because there could be rights that we might step on or laws on individual personalities that we might break," said Ramirez before the weekend.
this measure was thought of by Ramirez and commissioners Arnold Agustin, Charley Raymond Maxey, Ramon Fernandez and Fatima Celia Kiram after one athlete of the Philippine Amateur Sepak Takraw Association (PASTA) tested positive during the first week of this month.
a way for him to be kicked out by PASTA and PSC and even the one who enlisted him in the Philippine Navy (PN).
if officials of each NSA agree, the scheduled measure of the government sports agency will be included by giving players and coaches a contract, in the PSC's desire to take good care of players and coaches.
in explaining, the PSC will be joined by the person due to be seated as the Philippine Sports Institute (PSI) national training director, Marc Velasco.
