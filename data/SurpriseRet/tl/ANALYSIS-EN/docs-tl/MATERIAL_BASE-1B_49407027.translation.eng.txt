focusing is the start
anything we pay with attention and make a habit of improving is the one that decides our actions.
our joy and grief are based on this habit.
whatever of these two is chosen will decide our fate.
it is much better to have a positive outlook every day.
teach yourself to care for and treasure a cheerful heart, maintain a bright and happy temperament, and your life is a non-stop celebration and full of prosperity.
only one thing is needed to be changed in ourselves; to discover and enjoy happiness in our life.
what makes us happy is wherever our attention is focused on.
because if not for it, we have long stopped and focused our time on others.
as long as we continue with our habits or likes, it is what entertains and what we do.
your situation and personality now is a reflection of things you are accustomed to and continue to do.
if you observe yourself in the mirror, and examine deeply the person in front of you; what attitudes does this person have?
are they helpful or destructive?
a solution or a problem?
selfish or with concern for others?
happy or sad?
only you know the answers.
because whatever you are doing now; it is your world that makes you move.
remain focused on desires so your actions will have direction.
