December 30, 2016
the approved/disapproved list has become our tradition every year.
we do it after Christmas, before New Year.
in the list, the approved are those who gave a positive contribution to our industry.
they are those with stories of inspiration and good effort.
the disapproved are those NI ... needs improvement.
those that lack impact despite how very hard they tried.
hopefully, your celebration of Christmas is approved.
and hopefully, we will not be disapproved in the New Year.
approved: Charo Santos-Concio (for beautiful projects since her retirement in ABS-CBN.
kudos to Ang Babaeng Humayo). disapproved: Nora Aunor (hopefully Ate Guy will choose already the next movie she will do.
she no longer has anything to prove with her acting so hopefully, she will get to work with good projects and talented directors only.
) approved: Sharon Cuneta.
after the The Voice Kids and a successful 2-night concert in Solaire, we can really feel the return of the Megastar in showbiz with Your Face Sounds Familiar Kids and her reunion movie with Gabby Concepcion.
she also has a Cinemalaya film waiting.
disapproved: Kris Aquino.
from queen of all media, she has become the queen of social media.
like other say, showbiz, is just like politics.

approved: Judy Ann Santos.
Juday chooses no time.
even without a regular show on TV, her endorsements continue because of her good example to the people.
she was honored as an Anak TV Hall of Famer this year and recognized for her skill in the Cinemalaya entry Kusina.
she and Ryan Agoncillo renewed their wedding vows after they were blessed with their third child Luna at the start of the year.
