I will try Alex .
the question is is it the end of the famous Gangnam Style as we enter the year twenty thirteen ?
this seems to be what the Korean Pop star Psy is referring to in his official Twitter account with the hashtag Gangnam finale .
Psy posted on his Twitter account after his performance at Times Square in New York along with M_C Hammer .
he has already mentioned this in an interview for a music channel .
Psy said that he needs to write a new single especially since Gangnam Style was so famous but he said he will still dance Gangnam in Paris and China .
he is also set to have a concert in the Philippines in February .
