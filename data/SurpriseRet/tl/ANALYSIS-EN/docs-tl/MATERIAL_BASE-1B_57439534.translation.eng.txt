the straight path is slowly breaking down.
What has happened to the Righteous Path?
it seems to be falling apart.
It's falling apart in its own rust and it doesn't need to be broken for it to completely fall apart.
well, dude, two high-ranking officials and leaders of important government agencies are currently the hot topic.
first, about Arthur Juan, boss of the National Food Authority.
Juan and his ally, Attorney Patricia Galang, allegedly extorted 15 million pesos from an alleged rice hoarder who was caught.
during the raid of Juan, along with Interior Secretary Mar Roxas and Agriculture Modernization Secretary Kiko Pangilinan, Jomerito "Jojo" Soliman's 32,000 sacks of rice, which were mixed with animal feeds but were being sold as high quality rice, were allegedly found in Bulacan.
The NBI says that there is proof in Juan's cellphone and text messages that he asked for money from Soliman in exchange for not pressing charges and returning his business license.
second, two plunder cases were filed against PNP Chief Alan Purisima based on his unclear properties.
they were unclear because only limited information regarding his long list of properties was given in his Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth.
as we recall, President Noynoy himself ordered the investigation on Juan and he always said the truth would come out of the investigation, including those being carried out against his KKK.
for me, my man, let's give PNoy the benefit of the doubt.
who knows? despite defending his staff, there is also his acceptance of the truth that there are really those who don't follow the righteous path.
if he can expose his political enemies, he can also do the same to his allies.
