fire truck: P1 million, P9 million, P20 million
the weather is getting hotter and hotter though there are still some rainy days.
because of this, let's expect a frequent occurrence of fire everywhere from Batanes to Tawi-Tawi.
the question is: where are the fire trucks of firefighters?
according to the Bureau of Fire Department, especially the Department of Interior and Local Government, republic of Juan lacks 1,600 fire trucks.
wow, that's possible.
because there's more than 1,500 municipalities, and many doesn't have fire trucks.
not including the cities and provinces some of which do not have fire trucks yet.
if there were, it's outdated or defective and can almost be sold to a junk shop.
oOo
before Christmas last year, the plan of DILG to buy 76 fire trucks fumed and flared.
but they wanted imported ones that cost P20 million each.
this is where the local makers of fire trucks, that sells each unit for P9 million, complained.
it is puzzling that DILG wanted to import instead of buying local.
we don't know the outcome of this controversy.
all of those in DILG and BFP are silent.
and the mischievous only depends on diligence and skills of fire volunteers that are usually composed of Tsinoy siblings and the barangay.
oOo
here, we also remember the offer of fire truck by the fire volunteers.
they said, with P1 million, you can already have it, and a complete set of things for five to six firefighters.
if we buy 1,000 fire trucks, P1.3 billion which the DILG wants to spend for only 76 units is more than enough.
PNoy, please look at the nonsense of DILG.
