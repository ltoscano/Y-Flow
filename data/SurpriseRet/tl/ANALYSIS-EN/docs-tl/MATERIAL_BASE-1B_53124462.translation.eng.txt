Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, May 5 (PIA) - employees of the Nueva Vizcaya Electric Cooperative (NUVELCO) here are very ready to give proper and continuous flow of electricity in the coming election on Monday.
Said by Engineer Narciso Salunat, NUVELCO manager, power interruption will not occur starting May 6 until one week after the election so there will be continuous flow of electricity needed in the transmission of election results.
"we carried out the power interruptions to not disrupt the flow of elections and to prepare our facilities for the coming elections on Monday," said by Salunat.
according also to the NUVELCO manager, the electricity flowing to the province is at a stable level and it is not in danger of decreasing and lacking in the coming days.
according also to Salunat, they also dispersed their technicians to various places to provide help and service in case a problem occurs with the lines of NUVELCO including the posts and its facilities.
"Our performance is good with regard to paying for electricity to the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) which is why we can ask for additional electricity if there is a time the flow of electricity to the province decreases," Salunat added. (ALM/BME/PIA-2 Nueva Vizcaya)
