the retouched photos of Jinky Pacquiao and Charice in two fashion magazines is a hot topic now in Twitter and Facebook .
so was this really photoshopped or not ?
M_J Marfori tell the story .
classy and (()) sexy that is the former model in the cover of the latest issue in one fashion magazine .
but do you know that is Jinky Pacquiao ?
<no-speech>
in one magazine on the other hand the face of the cover girl is so young and small .
will you ever think that is actually Charice ?
shown in this video how Jinky was photographed all angles were taken hair was fixed dress as well as make-up .
so this kind of result was achieved .
a combination of make-up light and angle is the reason why this has become the image of Charice in the cover of the magazine .
we just photographed her we found her angle .
we put on the right clothes to elongate her .
like that was really it we didn't do very much .
but on social networking sites the sentiment that prevailed was that the pictures of Jinky and Charice were edited excessively on Photoshop .
countered by the creative director of fashion magazines .
yes you know there is Photoshop .
