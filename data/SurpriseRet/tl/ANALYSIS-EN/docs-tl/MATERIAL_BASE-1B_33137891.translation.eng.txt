philanthropist Ben Uri, praiseworthy!
today, April 5, the basketball game will be held by Mister Ben Uri, a famous business man and philanthropist in the city of Batangas.
it will be attended by 20 teams who are going to fight for the trophies and cash that will be given by Mister Uri. this is a one-month tournament called "Bolbok Basketball for a Cause."
this will be held at the new basketball court on the 2.5 hectare compound of the Tree House Restaurant, Hotel and Resorts which can be found on Diversion Road, Bolbok, Batangas, owned by Mister Uri.
a splendid P.5 million was spent in the court construction, and Mister Uri is going to spend another P.5M for the realization of the said basketball competition.
Mister Uri is a famous game fowl breeder and cocker who had the players uniform made to be used in the competition which will be finished on May 22 and by chance is also a fiesta in Barangay Bolbok.
the game is an offering of Mister Uri to the many youth and residents of Bolbok who like sports, according to our friend Cris Ibon.
similar to Mister Uri, Mister Ibon, a veteran journalist and businessman, is also a known game breeder and cocker in Batangas.
Mister Uri took the services of Councilor Veksler Jason Andal and Rey Persincula, supervisor of the Tree House Restaurant, Hotel and Resorts as basketball coordinators.
surely, the fiesta in Bolbok will be fun because Mister Uri will also get famous bands who are going to have a free live show on May 20 and coronation night on May 21.
the 12-man team Team CIA Orig was led by Cristuz Vivo V. Ibon, an OFW and youngest child of the journalist and businessman Cris Ibon-Aclan, is one of the participants and considered as the dark horse of the tournament.
Mister Ibon who is a resident of Bolbok have spent the entry of the CIA as a support to the sports advocacy of Mister Uri for his fellowman in Barangay Bolbok.
the outreach program of Mister Uri is praiseworthy.
