-the fast-paced change and added definitions of words greatly affects the improvement of Filipino dictionaries.
this is the center of discussion attended by some teachers, lexicographers, and academics of the University of the Philippines last 23rd of November.
"participation of people in the editorial practiced in imparting the meaning of polysemous words (of many definitions) can never be replaced," said Arthur Cassanova, a Tomasite lexicographer or expert in linguistics and creating dictionaries, in the said event.
he added, dictionary is a great instrument to preserve the awareness of proper pronunciation, proper spelling, and meaning of the words with added definitions in the future.
because of this, experts are being tested in implementing the new definitions of words used even before.
according to Evelyn Lanuza, professor of Leyte Normal University, there are times where the different use of terms according to origin is confusing.
she emphasizes the importance of dictionaries undergoing careful review before it's edited and produced.
