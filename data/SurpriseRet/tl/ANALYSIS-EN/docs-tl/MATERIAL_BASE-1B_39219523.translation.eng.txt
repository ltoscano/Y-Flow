before he passed away comedy king Dolphy wished to come home from the hospital .
that is why at two in the afternoon yesterday the convoy of his carcass passed from Heritage Park to his house in Marina Bay Parañaque as fulfillment of one of his last wishes .
you'll see him mouthing the word home .
it's clear to read home .
but the family only lasted ten minutes in Parañaque .
after this the convoy proceeded to the known second home of Dolphy A_B_S-C_B_N .
the fans of the king of comedy waited at EDSA .
some even stayed at the overpass of highway just to see their idol .
upon reaching A_B_S-C_B_N Kapamilyas greeted him .
