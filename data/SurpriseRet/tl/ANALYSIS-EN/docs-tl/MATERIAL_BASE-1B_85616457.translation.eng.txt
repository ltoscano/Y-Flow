see you this August!
aside from teaching two classes this sem, I agreed to different interviews this August (and there are some that had to be turned down because I can only take so much).
the month started for me with an interview about writing for Ateneo Junior High School, particularly with the members of the Loyola Book Club, on August 3.
I am still surprised at the interest of the children, and their questions and wonder.
and as a book club, really almost all of them came to the room carrying each of the different books they read.
now, in the last ten days of the month, here are the final four interviews I will give.
hopefully we see each other in any of these.
21 August/ whole afternoon interview and workshop together with the students of PHINMA - University of Pangasinan in Dagupan City.
I will travel to Dagupan on Sunday and stay overnight there to accommodate the interview from 8 o'clock to 5 o'clock, Q&A, and workshop to what they said are more or less 70 students.
27 August/ Bookuwentuhan about Janus Silang together with the students of Lourdes School in Quezon City.
I will be with Adarna House here starting one o'clock in the afternoon.
27 August /
after the Bookuwentuhan in Lourdes School, I will immediately travel up to Baguio for the interview the next day with Libro Ilokano 2016: 2nd Ilokano Book Fair that is a project of GUMIL and established by the NBDB.
on the morning of August 27 is my interview together with Allan Popa.
we will talk about my "seven reminders in writing a novel."
28 August / after the interview in Baguio, I will immediately go down to Manila for the panel discussion the next day on the final day of the The Philippine Readers & Writers Festival 2016 in Raffles Makati.
with me in the panel about writing for children are Mary Gigi Constantino and Xi Zuq.
will you be able to go to any of these?
or do you want to invite me to give an interview with you?
just contact me here.
