just sports! : a good send-off gift by Zaldy Perez
July 20, 2016 President Rodrigo Duterte gave a good send-off gift to our 2016 Rio Olympics-bound athletes.
in the courtesy call of the national athletes to the president in Malaca√±ang two days ago, President Duterte surprised them by announcing that their former allowance of US$1,000 will become $3,000.
even officials were included because from $3,000 their allowance became $5,000.
but, wish President Duterte just switched it around so that athletes got $5,000 and he made real the joke that officials are rich so they only get P500 peso.
still, because of what President Digong did, the athletes had additional inspiration for their participation in the Olympics.
in the 12 athletes that will participate in the Olympics that will start on August
5 and end on August 21 only six were able to come to the send off.
it is gladdening that the president of the country also has the welfare of athletes in mind.
he also announced that he will support the training of national athletes and the money his administration will use will be the collection from tax evaders.
but it is probably better if President Duterte will just include the funds for supporting our national athletes into the 2017 national budget.
through this, our national athletes will be ensured of funds from our government every year.
