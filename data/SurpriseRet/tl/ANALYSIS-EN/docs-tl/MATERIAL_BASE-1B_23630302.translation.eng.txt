part of Gran Copa by Andy Sevilla November 21, 2016 last Friday morning, we received a sad news about the death of the Australian race caller, Peter Morrison.
Peter had a huge participation in the racing industry in the country especially when talking about his contributions.
for the veteran racers, Peter became one of the faces of Gran Copa de Manila, an annual blockbuster event in the past, which is now an icon of the industry, even if it has long been gone.
he was already a part of it since the beginning through calling or race-calling of the races due to former Manila Mayor Ramon Bagatsing, who is named as the Father of Gran Copa de Manila.
they were guests then at the former San Lazaro Hippodrome in Manila when they were suddenly summoned by Mayor Bagatsing and was asked to call out the races that day.
that was the start but not the end of his participation at the aforementioned event including the racing industry because almost every year Peter has been a guest of the races.
nearly everyone in the industry considered Peter as a friend while the others considered him as a mentor because over time he taught valuable lessons to majority of the race callers today.
together with Doctor Norberto Quisumbing Junior, we visited Peter at the Makati Medical Center when he became ill suddenly before leaving the country early this year.
his sickness was already terminal and he needed to be immediately returned by his friend and companion, Glenn Ponabone to Australia .
following this, Peter continued to send emails before it stopped a few weeks ago.
until we were informed that he passed away last Friday morning.
goodbye, Peter!
